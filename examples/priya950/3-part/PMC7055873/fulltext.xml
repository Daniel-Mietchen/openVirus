We investigated the circulation patterns, antigenicity, and drug resistance of 2017 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from Myanmar and characterized the full genome of influenza virus strains in Myanmar from in-patients and out-patients to assess the pathogenicity of the viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from out-patients and in-patients with acute respiratory tract infections in Yangon and Pyinmana City in Myanmar during January-December 2017. A total of 215 out-patients and 18 in-patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detected by virus isolation and real-time RT-PCR. Among the positive patients, 90.6% were less than 14 years old. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Myanmar were similar to the recommended Japanese influenza vaccine strain for 2017&#x02013;2018 seasons (A/Singapore/GP1908/2015) and WHO recommended 2017 southern hemisphere vaccine component (A/Michigan/45/2015). Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin sequence showed that the Myanmar strains belonged to the genetic subclade 6B.1, possessing mutations of S162N and S164T at potential antigenic sites. However, the amino acid mutation at position 222, which may enhance the severity of disease and mortality, was not found. One case with no prior history of oseltamivir treatment possessed H275Y mutated virus in neuraminidase (NA), which confers resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir with elevated IC<sub>50</sub> values. The full genome sequence of Myanmar strains showed no difference between samples from in-patients and out-patients, suggesting no additional viral mutations associated with patient severity. Several amino acid changes were observed in PB2, PB1, and M2 of Myanmar strains when compared to the vaccine strain and other Asian strains. However, no mutations associated with pathogenicity were found in the Myanmar strains, suggesting that viral factors cannot explain the underlying reasons of the massive outbreak in Myanmar. This study reported the first detection of an oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus in Myanmar, highlighting the importance of continuous antiviral monitoring and genetic characterization of the influenza virus in Myanmar.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>the International Development Strategy Program for Infectious Diseases Research (J-GRID) of AMED (Japan Medical Research and Development Organization) (15fm0108009h0001-19fm0108009h0005)</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="6"/><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza outbreaks occur mainly during winter in temperate areas of the northern and southern hemispheres; however, influenza outbreaks in tropical areas around the equator may occur at any time of the year [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which emerged in 2009 and caused a global influenza pandemic, is now a seasonal influenza virus that co-circulates with another seasonal influenza (H3N2) and influenza B viruses. Worldwide circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has raised concerns about genotypic diversity that enhances virus transmissibility and pathogenicity and affects vaccine efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In 2008, Myanmar established a National Influenza Centre (NIC) at the National Health Laboratory in Yangon, which has been sharing data with the WHO by sending influenza isolates twice annually to the WHO collaborating center for new vaccine development, influenza genotyping, antiviral susceptibility, monitoring Influenza-like illness (ILI), and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance. However, influenza surveillance efforts in Myanmar are limited.

proteins of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses</title><p>The HA and NA genes of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in samples selected from 18 out-patients and 12 in-patients, including two cases with fatal outcomes, A/Myanmar/17MP009/2017 and A/Myanmar/17MP015/2017, were genetically characterized. To match the age group with in-patients, test samples of out-patients were randomly selected from children in the same age group (&#x0003c; 5 years old) for better comparison. We failed to sequence six out of 18 viruses from in-patients. All the analyzed Myanmar viruses belonged to genetic clade 6B.1 with amino acid substitutions of S84N, S162N, and I216T in HA [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229601.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The majority (26, 87%) of viruses possessed S164T in HA and formed a clade with the Indian 2017 and Japanese 2017&#x02013;2018 strains. Among them, 13 viruses from out-patients and 11 viruses from in-patients possessed a T314I substitution in HA. It was a unique amino acid substitution common among the Myanmar sequences. Two Myanmar out-patient viruses (A/Myanmar/17M204/2017 and A/Myanmar/17M307/2017) did not belong to these clusters but were closely related to Indian strains in the same year, 2017. Three out-patient viruses (A/Myanmar/17M109/2017, A/Myanmar/17M309/2017, and A/Myanmar/17M310/2017) and one in-patient virus (A/Myanmar/17MP001/2017) shared A215G and S297P substitutions and formed a group with the Japanese strains in 2016 and 2017, having a bootstrap value of over 90%.</p><fig id="pone.0229601.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0229601.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>HA and NA phylogeny of influenza A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic isolates in Myanmar in 2017.</title><p>Trees were constructed by the maximum likelihood method using MEGA software (version 6.06).

Around 60% of Myanmar out-patient viruses and all in-patient viruses shared the R173K amino acid substitution. Among the viruses from this cluster, two out-patient viruses possessed T438A substitution. H275Y mutation on neuraminidase was found in one A(H1N1)pdm09 strain (A/Myanmar/17M307/2017), which was from an out-patient with no prior history of anti-viral treatment. This resistant virus and another sensitive out-patient virus exhibited P93H substitution in NA. Three out-patient viruses and one in-patient virus exhibited the D451G substitution, which formed a small separate cluster as HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229601.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Internal gene analysis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses</title><p>We further characterized the amino acid substitutions in the remaining six segments of 25 Myanmar influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains, 13 out-patients including a case with NA/H275Y mutation and 12 in-patients, using next-generation sequencing.

All these mutations were frequently observed (10/13, 77%) in Myanmar out-patient strains. A/Myanmar/17MP009/2017 and A/Myanmar/17MP015/2017 strains from two fatal cases possessed the same amino acid mutations found in out-patients and in-patients who recovered from the disease (<xref rid="pone.0229601.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). A number of new mutations were observed in PB2 and PB1 in low frequencies, but none are indicated to have significant effect by FluSurver. Only sporadic mutations were found in PA and M1, NP and there was no common mutation in NS2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229601.s003">S3 Table</xref>).

The viruses involved in this outbreak were genetically very similar to A(H1N1)pdm09 strains circulating in Asia and other countries during the same year. There were no differences in the genetic characteristics of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza viruses collected from out-patients and in-patients, including cases with fatal outcomes. The antigenicity of the Myanmar viruses was similar to the vaccine strain. In addition, the first case of oseltamivir-resistant virus in Myanmar without prior oseltamivir treatment was detected in our study.</p><p>In Myanmar, the peak of influenza virus activity coincides with the rainy season. Myanmar has a tropical monsoon climate with three seasons: winter (November&#x02014;February), summer (March&#x02014;Mid May), and rainy (Mid May&#x02014;October) seasons, based on the analysis of pressure, rainfall, and temperature [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The study showed that the circulation of influenza viruses peaked in July, which is consistent with previous studies showing that the influenza season in Myanmar peaked in July or August, during the rainy season [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This observation is also similar to the national surveillance data reported to the regional and global influenza surveillance platform (FluNET), which showed that the regional influenza outbreak started during the rainy season from July (week 29) to September (week 36), and influenza virus activity peaked in August with 369 flu-positive cases during the reported weeks 31&#x02013;35 in 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Nationally, an increasing number of influenza cases was notified in July, and the large number of samples for influenza testing became a burden to NIC, which resulted in a restriction on sample handling in our study sites. Therefore, influenza detection was decreased in August at study sites compared to the national influenza peak period.</p><p>Antigenic analysis using the HI test showed that Myanmar strains in 2017 were similar to the vaccine strain A/Singapore/GP1908/2015, a vaccine component for the Japanese inactivated vaccine for the 2017/2018 season [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 belonged to 6B.1 clade and is antigenically similar to A/Michigan/45/2015, a vaccine component for the Southern hemisphere in 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Northern hemisphere in 2017/2018 [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, the HI results of the isolated viruses that reacted to the antisera raised against the vaccine strain had higher titer by 2&#x02013;4 fold increase than the homologous titer of the vaccine strain virus. The higher HI titer of test viruses than vaccine viruses is often observed in the circulating strains, and it merely shows an antigenic match with the vaccine strains. Indeed, a recent report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control shows that the HI titer of the circulating viruses was 2&#x02013;4 fold higher, indicating a match with the vaccine and the reference viruses [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. WHO changed the vaccine component from A/California/7/2009 to A/Michigan/45/2015 for the Southern hemisphere vaccine in 2017 because of the increasing number of clade 6B.1 viruses observed at the beginning of 2016. Clade 6B.1 viruses were reported to show similar antigenicity to ferret antisera against A/California/7/2009 when tested by the HI test, but they reacted poorly with pediatric, adult, and older adult pre- and post-vaccination sera [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, WHO changed the vaccine component into A/Michigan/45/2015 from the 2017 southern hemisphere vaccine. In this outbreak, Myanmar experienced severe cases of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 in 2017; however, it turned out that these viruses matched with the vaccine strain.</p><p>According to the phylogenetic analysis, the 2017 Myanmar influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains belonged to clade 6B.1 and were closely related to the strains that circulated in India and other countries during the same period. India reported several outbreaks and severe cases caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 of Clade 6B and 6B.1 during 2015&#x02013;2017 [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We suspect the possibility of transmission from India or other countries situated to the west of Myanmar because early cases of this outbreak were reported from Chin State, which shares its western border with Bangladesh. The analyzed strains in this study are genetically similar to the vaccine viruses, A/Michigan/45/2015 and A/Singapore/GP1908/2015. It was known that S74R, I295V mutations in HA protein were recently acquired by the virus; this mutation has high frequency of detection (66%) globally [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, about 32% of global strains had the S164T mutation, and it is reported as the most recent mutation observed among 2017 strains [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similarly, these mutations were highly detected (87%) in Myanmar strains. In contrast to Myanmar strains, amino acid substitutions A73V, V321I, T508A, and I510T, were reported from Central India sequences in 2017 with low global occurrence [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Another known important amino acid change, D222N/G in HA, was not detected in viruses from Myanmar in-patients. This mutation affects virus tropism and enhances the severity of disease and mortality by assisting viral binding to &#x003b1;-2,3 receptors, which are mainly present in the lower respiratory tract with the occurrence of 0.4% frequency at global level [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In NA phylogeny, amino acid substitutions V13I, I34V, and I314M were found in all Myanmar strains. These substitutions were also detected in Indian and Nepalese A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak strains in early 2015, which suggests the coevolution of HA and NA [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. According to our investigation (unpublished data), influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses, which were the predominant circulating strains in Myanmar during 2016, could be a possible reason for this big outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm09 and it may be responsible for the reduced herd immunity against A(H1N1)pdm09, when the new 6B.1 clade virus was introduced in Myanmar in 2017.</p><p>Genetic characterization of six internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP, and NS) showed that there were no marked genetic changes related to increased pathogenicity. Several complex factors are associated with severe pneumonia: viral factors, such as mutations in the polymerase, HA, PB1-F2, polymerase acidic protein frameshift, and host factors, such as comorbidities, single-nucleotide polymorphism, inflammation, high cytokines and chemokines; bacterial factors, such as function of attachment, replication, and loss of repair can result in secondary bacterial infections [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. No significant genetic differences were found between 13 viruses collected from out-patients and 12 viruses from in-patients. It was, thus, suggested that the severity of illness is not caused by the differences of virus strains between in-patients and out-patients but characteristics of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 causing viral pneumonia [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this study, internal genes of Indian strains and Myanmar strains were compared. The local circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 was observed from 2016 to 2017 in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh prior to the outbreaks in Myanmar [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Among the four mutation differences between Myanmar and Indian strains, the only functional significance was at position 27 in the M2 segment that confers resistance to amantadine. Adamantane-resistant influenza variants have been circulating in the world for decades [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. M2 gene mutations associated with resistance to amantadine were found in only about 1% of V27A mutations compared to 95% of S31N mutation [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, all of Myanmar and Indian strains in this study also possessed S31N mutation. It is highly presumable that strains from the two countries shared the same source of origin because Myanmar and Indian strains shared higher percentage of sequence identity. No additional viral genetic changes associated with disease severity were identified so far.</p><p>Here, we report the identification and detection of a H275Y mutation in NA that confer resistant to oseltamivir from an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolate in community samples of Myanmar, which was detected for the first time in Myanmar; however, its detection rate was low at only 0.5%. In Myanmar, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was first detected in 2009 and the oseltamivir-resistant H275Y variant has not been detected in specimens, either from the community or hospitalized patients since then, although all isolates tested showed the S31N mutation in M2 that conferred resistance to amantadine [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Oseltamivir was not previously used for the treatment of influenza in Myanmar, but at the time of the outbreak in 2017, it was supplied by the WHO as an emergency control measure. The drug was administered to the admitted patients with severe cases of influenza infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229601.s004">S1 File</xref>), but the number of prescribed courses for estimating the effect on the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant strain is not available. It was already reported worldwide that oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections were detected in community settings with no known exposure to oseltamivir and the resistant virus spread within the community even in the absence of drug-selective pressure [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This fact suggests that there is a possibility of rapid transmission of resistant strains from patients, who were already treated with oseltamivir, in a short period after prescribing the antiviral drug in Myanmar. Moreover, this virus showed high reduced inhibition (HRI) with high fold-increase in IC<sub>50</sub> (198 and 274) to two NAIs, oseltamivir and peramivir. Global analysis on the susceptibility of human influenza viruses to the NAI reported that the most common NA amino acid substitution was H275Y in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, which confers HRI by oseltamivir and peramivir [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] without affecting the susceptibility to zanamivir and laninamivir [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Despite the low prevalence of oseltamivir-resistance according to our study data, it highlights the necessity for continuous monitoring of the influenza virus and close surveillance of antiviral drug resistance in Myanmar.</p><p>There were no known fatal cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 reported in Myanmar until 2017. Indeed 2 of our pediatric in-patients who underwent drug susceptibility and genetic sequencing were death cases. Moreover, detailed characterization of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses is very limited [<xref rid="pone.0229601.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and whole-genome sequencing of Myanmar influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains have not been characterized before our study.</p><p>Nonetheless, this study has several limitations. The samples tested herein were collected from two surveillance sites for out-patients and from one children hospital for in-patients. Due to the limitations of human resources in Myanmar, there was no hospital to collect samples from in-patients and out-patients in the same surveillance site within the study period. Therefore, we decided to select two hospitals for out-patients and one hospital for in-patients. Moreover, influenza-positive sample size of in-patients was quite small compared to out-patients even though we collected 288 in-patients. We detected the first oseltamivir-resistant strain in Myanmar, but the epidemiological link of the patient was unclear. Besides, we could analyze only two out-patients in Pyinmana by NGS. It would be more useful if we could increase the number of samples for sequencing for a more comprehensive analysis. Analysis of NGS data is still ongoing, and the results will be published elsewhere.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we characterized the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains that circulated in Myanmar during the 2017 outbreak and attempted to identify factors that are responsible for the virulence of the virus, which may cause the severity of influenza among in-patients by comparing with the out-patient strains. Although viral genome features responsible for the differential severity of influenza between in-patients and out-patients could not be thoroughly elucidated, we present the first-time characterization of Myanmar influenza viruses by the full genome sequencing. This study demonstrates the importance of continuing antiviral monitoring, epidemiological investigations, and genetic characterization in the data-limited country like Myanmar.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0229601.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Details of whole genomes of Myanmar influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 used in this study.</title><p>All the data are registered to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0229601.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0229601.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Details of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, HA and NA sequences used in the phylogenetic tree in this study.</title><p>All the data are registered to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0229601.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0229601.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Detail of amino acid substitutions found in PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP, and NS protein of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected from out-patients and in-patients in Myanmar compared with viruses from India in 2017.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0229601.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0229601.s004"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Influenza (H1N1)pdm infection.</title><p>Management Protocol and Case Report Form.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: This is a descriptive study on H1N1 influenza viruses isolated from in-patients and out-patients (mostly less than 14 years old) in Myanmar in 2017. It was motivated following a community outbreak during this year and declaration a high level of alert.</p><p>The authors investigated the circulation patterns, distribution of influenza subtypes, antigenic and genetic characterization of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors.</p><p>The virus circulating in Myanmar was found to have several HA mutations including S84N, S162N and I216T; and NA mutations including V13I, I34V and I314M substitutions which placed the circulating H1N1 virus in the 6.1B clade.</p><p>Minor concerns</p><p>1. The introduction is well written, encompasses some aspects of influenza virology relevant to surveillance and focused properly on the work done here.</p><p>2. In M&#x00026; M, Neuraminidase assay section can be written better. It is somehow confusing. For instance in three sequential sentences &#x0201c;FOUR KINDS OF NAI&#x0201d; was repeated.</p><p>3. In line 196 (pdf version), &#x0201c;The HA and NA proteins of selected A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;The HA and NA genes of selected A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses&#x0201d;.</p><p>4. In results, some data presented in table 1 are repeated in the text unnecessarily, also, demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of A(H1N1)pdm09 patients are clearly explained in table 2 and no need for more explanation. Please present the data just one time; table or text.</p><p>5. In table 6, please refer to appropriate article when mention to play a role in viral oligomerization interfaces and binding of small ligands/ to be related to virulence when combined with V3 and N328K for an avian virus A/quail/Vietnam/36/04 (H5N1) and to be related to drug resistance to amantadine.(line 452 -455 pdf version)</p><p>6. Please explain why did you Sanger sequencing while you could obtain the same data from NGS.</p><p>Major concern:</p><p>How you can explain HI results? The isolated viruses reacted to antisera raised against vaccine strain even more than the vaccine strain virus!! It should be Vice Versa. Do you think the data presented in this part is reasonable? Please clearly argue about this issue in discussion.</p><p>Reviewer #2: MAJOR POINTS</p><p>1. Title. I would suggest changing the title to something like &#x02013; influenza full-genome sequencing for surveillance of pathogenic markers and antiviral resistance during the 2017 season in Myanmar.</p><p>2. Abstract. There is no mention on the in-patients here</p><p>3. L121. Please specify location of the YKCH Hospital (Myanmar, I guess)</p><p>4. Besides, one of the problems with this paper is that in-patients were selected from a different center from that of out-patients. Why only 12? This limitation needs to be acknowledged in the discussion. Why did you not include as in-patients those patients who were finally admitted in the two surveillance hospitals? The comparison of mild/severe cases from different sites needs an explanation.</p><p>5. L164-165. Please provide a table with the sequences for the primers and probes, or an adequate reference for the work describing those.</p><p>6. L218. Please, specify details on the software: what is type of treatment to the NGS raw data? What is the output? Only consensus files? Coverage, and variant tables?</p><p>7. L231. The authors used MEGA for the phylogenetic analysis but, what was the evolutionary model best fitting the data (for every segment and for the whole genome)? Dis you consider that in the phylogenetic analysis?</p><p>8. L282. For the patients included, did you collect the previous vaccination status?</p><p>9. L415 segments, no proteins</p><p>10. L420. For the NGS whole-genome sequence there are no details on the results obtained (i.e. mean coverage per segment, depth per nucleotide, variants per segment (synonymous, non-synonymous, major and minor) etc.</p><p>11. Besides, the analyses performed on NGS data seem limited to the consensus sequences. The authors do not provide a (major and minor) variant analysis for the 8 genome segments, table S3 seems just a summary of alignments using consensus sequences. It would be interesting to see if minor variants were more/less abundant in patients with severe outcome.</p><p>12. Further, there is no phylogenetic analysis on the other segments different from HA or NA&#x02026;nor using the complete genome, data that may be also useful to look for reassortment/recombination.</p><p>13. L434-436. I believe this last sentence may be not relevant for the reader.</p><p>14. L533.

We have checked and corrected the manuscript according to PLOS ONE&#x02019;s format.</p><p>We have done 3 major changes in the revised manuscript. One of the authors has changed from Nobuhiro Takemae to Yuko Uchida due to the mistake of a person who conducted the NGS. We elaborated the information for the in-patients and added the clinical characteristics of the in-patients. Additionally, we also added the internal genes sequence of the H275Y mutated virus analyzed by NGS. </p><p>Academic Editor&#x02019;s Comments </p><p>1. Line 58, replace "HI" with "Hemagglutination inhibition (HI)"</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 56-59, page 3: We changed as &#x0201c;Hemagglutination inhibition (HI)&#x0201d; and modified the sentence. </p><p>2. Line 121, please provide more information regarding in-patients, how many samples? Are they similar to out-patients in characteristics, etc.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 131-132, 136-140, page 7: We provided more information regarding in-patients including sample collection site, patient symptoms with inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p>Line 272-306, page 13-15: We also revised and modified Table 1 and Table 2 providing more information of in-patients. </p><p>Line 558-563, page 28-29: We reported our study limitations about in-patients in the discussion part. </p><p>3. Line 184: replace "MUNANA" with "2&#x02032;-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-&#x003b1;-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA)".</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 204-205, page 10: We replaced "2&#x02032;-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-&#x003b1;-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA)" instead of MUNANA.</p><p>4.

Line 194 -195, suggest removing "using Sanger Method" from the title</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 235-238, page 11-12: We deleted the whole paragraph &#x0201c;Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase gene sequencing using Sanger Method&#x0201d; and incorporated into the paragraph &#x0201c;Phylogenetic analysis&#x0201d; to reflect the suggestion from reviewer 1, comment 6.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Minor concerns</p><p>1. The introduction is well written, encompasses some aspects of influenza virology relevant to surveillance and focused properly on the work done here.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Thank you very much for your comment. </p><p>2. In M&#x00026; M, Neuraminidase assay section can be written better. It is somehow confusing. For instance in three sequential sentences &#x0201c;FOUR KINDS OF NAI&#x0201d; was repeated.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 198-204, page 10: We changed repeated words &#x0201c;FOUR KINDS OF NAI&#x0201d; and made some changes on Neuraminidase assay section to be better and clear.</p><p>3. In line 196 (pdf version), &#x0201c;The HA and NA proteins of selected A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;The HA and NA genes of selected A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses&#x0201d;.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>The sentence was deleted during revision as per response to reviewer 1, comment 6.</p><p>4. In results, some data presented in table 1 are repeated in the text unnecessarily, also, demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of A(H1N1)pdm09 patients are clearly explained in table 2 and no need for more explanation. Please present the data just one time; table or text.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 272-306, page 13-15: We presented the data one time mainly in Tables (both Table 1 and 2) and removed duplicate data from text under result section in revised manuscript. </p><p>We modified Table 1 and 2 and provided more information about in-patients as suggested by academic editor and reviewer 2. </p><p>5. In table 6, please refer to appropriate article when mention to play a role in viral oligomerization interfaces and binding of small ligands/ to be related to virulence when combined with V3 and N328K for an avian virus A/quail/Vietnam/36/04 (H5N1) and to be related to drug resistance to amantadine.(line 452 -455 pdf version)</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>We deleted the irrelevant sentence and reference (line 434-436 of original version) as suggested by reviewer 2, comment 13. </p><p>Line 433, page 22: We added the appropriate article related to drug resistance to amantadine. </p><p>Line 421-435, page 21-22: We summarized the internal gene analysis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and added the result of oseltamivir-resistant Myanmar out-patient strain (A/Myanmar/17M307/2017) in Table 6 of revised manuscript.</p><p> 6. Please explain why did you Sanger sequencing while you could obtain the same data from NGS.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 235-238, page 11-12: In previous manuscript, we did not sequence the oseltamivir-resistant case in NGS but in Sanger method. In revised manuscript, we have done NGS to the oseltamivir-resistant case. As a consequence, the paragraph &#x0201c;Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase gene sequencing using Sanger Method&#x0201d; incorporated in the paragraph &#x0201c;Phylogenetic analysis&#x0201d; in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Major concern:</p><p> How you can explain HI results? The isolated viruses reacted to antisera raised against vaccine strain even more than the vaccine strain virus!! It should be Vice Versa. Do you think the data presented in this part is reasonable? Please clearly argue about this issue in discussion.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 469-475, page 25: We added the explanation about this in discussion. </p><p>Reviewer #2: </p><p>Major points</p><p>1. Title. I would suggest changing the title to something like &#x02013; influenza full-genome sequencing for surveillance of pathogenic markers and antiviral resistance during the 2017 season in Myanmar.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Thank you so much for your kind suggestion to change the title. However, we would like to highlight the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during the 2017 season in Myanmar and focus the first case of antiviral resistance not only full-genome sequencing analysis in our MS. We kindly request you to accept the MS title to remain as before; &#x0201c;Epidemic of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 analyzed by full genome sequences and a first case of oseltamivir-resistant strain in Myanmar 2017&#x0201d;.</p><p>2. Abstract. There is no mention on the in-patients here</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Lines 52-54, page 3: The information is added in the abstract.</p><p>3. L121. Please specify location of the YKCH Hospital (Myanmar, I guess)</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 132, page 7: We specified the location of YKCH hospital in revised text.</p><p>4. Besides, one of the problems with this paper is that in-patients were selected from a different center from that of out-patients. Why only 12? This limitation needs to be acknowledged in the discussion. Why did you not include as in-patients those patients who were finally admitted in the two surveillance hospitals? The comparison of mild/severe cases from different sites needs an explanation.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 382-383, page 20: We inserted the reason for the numbers of the in-patients sequenced.</p><p>Line 558-563, page 28-29: We added and explained these limitations in discussion. </p><p>5. L164-165. Please provide a table with the sequences for the primers and probes, or an adequate reference for the work describing those.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 189, page 9: We previously described the appropriate reference number 12 in the original version.</p><p>6. L218. Please, specify details on the software: what is type of treatment to the NGS raw data? What is the output? Only consensus files? Coverage, and variant tables?</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 222-231, page 11 and line 351-354, page 18: In this time, the variant rate of oseltamivir resistant amino acid substitution at position 275 in NA was provided but the variant table for other positions was not provided. </p><p>Line 566-570, page 29: We also added these limitations in discussion of revised manuscript.</p><p>7. L231. The authors used MEGA for the phylogenetic analysis but, what was the evolutionary model best fitting the data (for every segment and for the whole genome)? Dis you consider that in the phylogenetic analysis?</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 247-251, page 12: We clarified the best fitting model in the revised manuscript. </p><p>8. L282. For the patients included, did you collect the previous vaccination status?</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 297-298, page 14: We collected the previous influenza vaccination status and added it in revised text. </p><p>9. L415 segments, no proteins</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 414, page 21: We changed as segments as you suggested.</p><p>10. L420. For the NGS whole-genome sequence there are no details on the results obtained (i.e. mean coverage per segment, depth per nucleotide, variants per segment (synonymous, non-synonymous, major and minor) etc.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 566-570, page 29: The further analysis of the six internal genes and details of the NGS whole-genome sequencing results obtained will be reported in the next paper. </p><p>11. Besides, the analyses performed on NGS data seem limited to the consensus sequences. The authors do not provide a (major and minor) variant analysis for the 8 genome segments, table S3 seems just a summary of alignments using consensus sequences. It would be interesting to see if minor variants were more/less abundant in patients with severe outcome.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 566-570, page 29, line 351-354, page 18, Table 6 and S3 Table: In the revised manuscript, we did not describe the minor variants analysis because much detail analysis on epidemiological findings was needed. In addition, we added the variant rate of oseltamivir-resistance tyrosine amino acid substitution at position 275 in NA gene of one oseltamivir- resistant Myanmar strain in &#x0201c;Drug resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus&#x0201d; under results section. We added the internal genes of oseltamivir-resistant H275Y mutated virus. </p><p>12. Further, there is no phylogenetic analysis on the other segments different from HA or NA&#x02026;nor using the complete genome, data that may be also useful to look for reassortment/recombination.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 566-570, page 29: We added the limitations in discussion as per response to comment 10 and 11.</p><p>13. L434-436. I believe this last sentence may be not relevant for the reader.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>We deleted the irrelevant sentence as your comment.</p><p>14. L533. There were in fact some differences between strains from Myanmar and those from India, see table 6!</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 430-435, page 22, line 521-527, page 27: We explained and inserted the additional information and also added the related reference number 25.</p><p>15. L559-577 these two paragraphs show information that can be parly included in the introduction and that can be significantly streamlined, avoiding some details that may not be interesting to the reader.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 96-103, page 5, line 116-119, page 6: We moved some information from here to introduction section and deleted some details.</p><p>16. L581. Here the authors should acknowledge the limitations on patient inclusion raised on the points above.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 558-563, page 28-29: We added the limitations on patient inclusion.</p><p>17. L585. It would be interesting to see if you found any minor variants in NA at positions associated with NAI resistence, discuss here.</p><p>Response to comment:</p><p>Line 351-354, page 18: We added the result as per response. </p><p>18.
