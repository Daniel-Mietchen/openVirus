  <p>PCA analysis of the optimized (d)nts for the PB2 and PB1 segments between human and avian IAV sequences. The optimized 9 and 12 (d)nts for the PB2 (
   <italic>A</italic>) and PB1 (
   <italic>B</italic>) segments, respectively, were converted into two principal components and were then plotted with pairplot (seaborn package, Python) (lower-left panel and upper-right panel in each figure subpart). The distribution of principal components 1 (PCA_1) and 2 (PCA_2) of avian (blue) and human (orange) sequences were indicated by kernel density estimation (KDE) (upper-left panel and lower-right panel in each figure subpart), and the separability between avian and human sequences was shown for the PB2 (
   <italic>A</italic>) and PB1 (
   <italic>B</italic>) segments with the pair plots and KDE.
