  <p>Heatmap and hierarchical clustering of human and avian IAV PB2 sequences based on the Euclidean distance of the optimized (d)nts. The 61 PB2 sequence samples were randomly (random state = 1) selected from PB2 (3.59â€°) and then clustered with a heatmap and hierarchical clustering for PB2 based on the Euclidean distance of the optimized 9 (d)nts; the sequence identity and (d)nts were clustered. Standardized scaling was performed for data with the function (x-x.mean)/x.std. The color in the heatmap presented the value for each (d)nt on the 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis, as shown by the color bar in the upper-left corner. The hierarchical relationships for the sampled sequences and (d)nts are indicated on the left and upper sides, respectively, in each image. The red-blue column to the left of the heatmap was utilized to show the human (red) and avian (blue) groups.
