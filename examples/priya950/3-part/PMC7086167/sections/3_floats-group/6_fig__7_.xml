  <p>The prediction of the human adaptation of swine and avian IAV sequences before the 2009 influenza pandemic. Human-adaptive swine (
   <italic>A</italic>) and avian (
   <italic>B</italic>) IAV sequences before the 2009 influenza pandemic were predicted by the SVC model with a probability threshold of 0.5. The total number of sequences, the number of adaptive sequences, and the human adaptation ratio are represented by the orange, blue, and yellow histograms, respectively. The human adaptation ratio is also presented as a floating number above the stacked histogram. IAV subtypes are indicated by the labels along the 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis.
