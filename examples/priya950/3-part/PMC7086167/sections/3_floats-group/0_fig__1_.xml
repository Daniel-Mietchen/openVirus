  <p>The workflow of data processing, feature optimization, and model construction. (
   <italic>A</italic>) The workflow of data processing and model construction. Original ORF sequences within the length range were utilized for codon dependently counting 12 mononucleotides (nts) and 48 dinucleotides (dnts). The counting file for the 60 (d)nts for the PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, or NA segments was randomly resampled to maintain a balanced distribution of human and avian sequences. The (d)nt composition distribution and the sequence phylogeny were analyzed, and then the randomly split (d)nt counting data were utilized for model building and testing. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Workflow of the feature extraction with PCA/ SVC methods. The 60 (d)nts were sorted according to the score (AUC) from the SVC analysis, with the PCA-extracted principal component from the randomly selected (d)nt counting information. Accumulated (d)nts in the sorted list were analyzed with ML models, with the cross of the AUC score curve down its MA score (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) as the threshold of the best number of (d)nts. “DF2_60 (d)nts.csv” for the (d)nt sorting and “Best x (d)nts” for data optimization were, respectively, labeled with blue and green text boxes filled in both (
   <italic>A</italic>) and (
   <italic>B</italic>).
