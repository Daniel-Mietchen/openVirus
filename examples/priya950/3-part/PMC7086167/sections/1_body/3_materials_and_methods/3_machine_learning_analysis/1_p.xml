The data were split with StratifiedKFold from sklearn.model_selection (n_splits = 5, random_state = 1, shuffle = True) into five training/test sets before supervised learning was implemented (Script-4, supplementary file,

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scipy.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.scipy.org</ext-link>) was utilized to build a hierarchical clustering of the IAV sequences based on the Euclidean distance between/among sequences.
