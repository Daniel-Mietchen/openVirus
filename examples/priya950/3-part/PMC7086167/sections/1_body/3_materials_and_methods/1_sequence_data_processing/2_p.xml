<p>Sequences with duplicate ID, incorrect labels, or out-of-length ranges were excluded, and the remaining 217,549 sequences are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online. To avoid a country/area bias for ML modeling, due to the overwhelming majority of US samples, we randomly resampled the US sequences, with the United States to China ratio of approximately 1:1 for each segment (Script-3, supplementary file, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online), via the pandas.DataFrame.sample (Python) model. In total, 46,042 randomly resampled human-adaptive sequences and 46,488 human-inadaptive avian sequences were utilized for feature extraction and model building. Human-originated H5N1, H7N9, and other subtypes were excluded from the human adaptation set and were not included in the avian set for model building.
