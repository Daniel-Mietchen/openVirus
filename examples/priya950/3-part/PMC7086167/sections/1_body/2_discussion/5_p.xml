<p>An A(H1N1)pdm09 virus caused the latest worldwide influenza pandemic (

Here, our results regarding the high human adaptability of swine IAVs before 2009 in the United States precisely predicted the high risk of these IAVs. Of course, a possible underestimation of human-adaptive swine viruses/sequences was not excluded in many high-risk developing countries, such as China and Vietnam, due to a likely undeveloped monitoring/detection program for swine influenza. However, a marked lower human adaptation of the swine IAV sequence was also indicated by our model in the area of the European Union, which is the second largest pig plantation area, with twice as much pig production in this area in 2018 than the United States (

Moreover, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was not initiated in China, although pork production in China is 4-fold that of the United States. This phenomenon implies that our results might reveal the “true” severity of swine infection of human-adaptive swine viruses in the United States rather than in other areas before 2009.
