<p>IAVs must acquire sufficient human adaptation before they can promote human pandemics. To date, there has been no universal definition of IAVs’ human adaptation, although numerous human-adaptive viral determinants have been reported (
 <xref rid="msz276-B42" ref-type="bibr">Taubenberger and Kash 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msz276-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bouvier 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msz276-B23" ref-type="bibr">Long et al. 2019</xref>). In the present study, we defined it as the capability to infect humans easily, to transmit among populations efficiently, and to be virulent to some degree to humans. Accordingly, the human-adaptive IAVs were limited to the H3N2 and H1N1 viruses, either of which can continuously cause endemics or even pandemics in humans (

 <xref rid="msz276-B49" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msz276-B34" ref-type="bibr">Rudge and Coker 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msz276-B14" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. 2014</xref>) were classified into the avian-adaptive group. There might be a concern about a selection bias of the human adaptation criteria. If so, the “human adaptation” label for the four segments (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) would be wrongly associated with “H3N2” or “H1N1,” which would be inconsistent with the “true” human adaptation of these segments. Under such circumstances, the “true” human-adapted PB2, PB1, PA, and NP sequences of the human-adaptive H2N2 virus (
 <xref rid="msz276-B5" ref-type="bibr">Cox and Subbarao 2000</xref>) might be underestimated, and the host adaptation of the four segments of swine H1N2 virus would not be correctly predicted. However, high HA and NA of the human adaptation frequencies were unanimously predicted for the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP sequences for both the H2N2 and H1N2 viruses. Interestingly, since 2005, dozens of human H1N2 infection cases have been reported in the United States (Pulit-Penaloza et al. 2018) and the Netherlands (
 <xref rid="msz276-B25" ref-type="bibr">Meijer et al. 2018</xref>); the high human adaptation of the H1N2 virus was also experimentally supported (Pulit-Penaloza et al. 2018). Therefore, the IAV human adaptation criteria are acceptable to some degree, according to the existing human-adapted IAVs.
