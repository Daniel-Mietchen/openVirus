<p>In the last few decades, the overwhelming majority of studies on viral determinants have focused on protein levels for virus infection, transmission, virulence, and host adaptation. In particular, distinct protein signatures for host tropism (

 <xref rid="msz276-B31" ref-type="bibr">Qiang et al. 2018</xref>) have been recognized with ML methods. Recently, accumulating reports found a significant influence of synonymous viral nucleotide or dinucleotide mutation on the virus response to the host’s innate immune system (

Here, we compressed the full-length coding information of the six segments into the counting information of 12 nts and 48 dnts, all of which were sorted according to their classification importance with the PCA/SVC method. Optimization is one of the crucial parts of machine/deep learning. A moving average (MA; 
 <xref rid="msz276-B18" ref-type="bibr">Kashyap 1982</xref>), also known as the rolling mean, was utilized here to optimize the number of features for the ML models, with the crossing of the MA with its MA3 value as a cutoff point, at which the number of (d)nts was the best.
