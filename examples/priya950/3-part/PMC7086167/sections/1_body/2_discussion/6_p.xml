<p>In summary, the human-adaptive and avian-adaptive nucleotide compositions of influenza A viruses (IAVs) were determined with supervised/unsupervised ML methods. ML, based on human-adaptive nucleotide composition, performed well in predicting the human adaptation of IAVs before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. This approach might be promising for the prediction of the risk of an influenza pandemic and global vulnerability to influenza.</p>
