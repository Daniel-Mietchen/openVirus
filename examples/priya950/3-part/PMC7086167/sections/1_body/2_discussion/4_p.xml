<p>The species-specific (

 <xref rid="msz276-B8" ref-type="bibr">Di Giallonardo et al. 2017</xref>) dinucleotide composition has been computationally explored for viruses. The genomic dinucleotide composition of RNA viruses is useful for predicting viral reservoir hosts and arthropod vectors (
 <xref rid="msz276-B2" ref-type="bibr">Babayan et al. 2018</xref>). Therefore, we speculated here that the mono-/dinucleotide composition should be another critical genomic feature, and we assume here that there should be a species selection bias of IAV nucleotides/dinucleotides. Taking PB2 as an example, the frequency of T, C, A, or G at the first position and G at the third position within a codon, the odds ratios of ct_N3M1, ag_N12 and at_N12 determined the human adaptation of IAVs. According to the eukaryotic codon list (
 <xref rid="msz276-B35" ref-type="bibr">Shu 2017</xref>), every amino acid is coded by one (for methionine and tryptophan) to six trinucleotide codons (for leucine, serine, and arginine); six (phenylalanine, leucine, serine, tyrosine, cysteine, and tryptophan), five, seven, and five types of amino acids were respectively dependent on the nucleotides of T, C, A, and G, at the first nucleotide position within a codon, 4–7 types of amino acids were dependent on the four types of nucleotides at the first nucleotide position, and 13–15 types of amino acids were dependent on the four types of nucleotides at the third nucleotide position. Therefore, each mononucleotide feature is theoretically associated only with 5–15 possible amino acids (the stop codon is not considered). Accordingly, every dinucleotide is associated with 1–4 types of amino acids (
 <xref rid="msz276-B35" ref-type="bibr">Shu 2017</xref>). Therefore, the nucleotide composition was associated only with the amino acid compositional information, with less than 50% probability. Thus, we speculated that the genomic composition of mono-/dinucleotides is another essential genomic characteristic of IAVs and is probably biologically associated with the host adaptation of IAVs.
