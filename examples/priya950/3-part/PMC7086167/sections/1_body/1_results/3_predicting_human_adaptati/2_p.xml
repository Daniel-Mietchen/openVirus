<p>An SVC was used to predict the human adaptation of all IAV sequence samples, with the optimized (d)nts, with the same number of tail (d)nts in the sorted list as control. The true negative rate and the true positive rate for the control (d)nts were 64.76% and 95.58%, respectively, for the PB2 segment (upper-left panel,

 </xref>). However, the true negative/positive rates for the optimized (d)nts for the PB2 segment were 98.45% and 94.10%, respectively (lower-left panel,

 </xref>, the prediction and the probability of the optimized (d)nt-based SVC was markedly higher than that of the control (d)nt-based SVC. High performance with the optimized (d)nts was also obtained with the other three supervised learning models (GBRT, RF classifier, and MLP classifier) (
