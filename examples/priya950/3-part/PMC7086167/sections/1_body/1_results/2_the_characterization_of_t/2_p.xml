<p>An ML analysis combining PCA and SVC was performed to characterize the human adaptation-associated nucleotide composition of IAVs from the 60 (d)nts. As the workflow (

The statistical analysis results of the cross-validation score (Cross_val score) from the PCA/SVC for the 60 (d)nts of each segment are listed in
