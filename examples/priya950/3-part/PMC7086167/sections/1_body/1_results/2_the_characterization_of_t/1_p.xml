<p>The (d)nt composition was counted and compared within and between species based on the profile of relative dinucleotide abundance values according to previous reports (
 <xref rid="msz276-B17" ref-type="bibr">Karlin and Mrazek 1997</xref>). Hierarchical clustering was performed for 3.59–5.01‰ (59–61) randomly sampled sequences from each segment sequence set according to the (d)nt composition. The majority of human and avian IAVs were not clustered into human and avian branches, respectively, for the PB1, PA, HA, and NA segments (

Additionally, a PCA transversion of the 60 (d)nts was performed to evaluate the linear separability between major human sequences and avian sequences. There was no such separability in the principal component 1 or principal component 2 of the 60 (d)nts in the PB2, PA, HA, or NA segments; only the PB1 and NP segments were separable for both groups of subtypes for principal component 1 (
