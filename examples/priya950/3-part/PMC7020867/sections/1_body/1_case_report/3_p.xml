<p>The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed supraventricular tachycardia (230 bpm) not responsive to intravenous adenosine. An electric cardioversion was performed and successfully restored the normal heart rhythm. A new EKG was performed showing ST elevation with upper concavity and PR segment depression in DII, DIII and aVF, such as ST depression in V1 and aVR. The patient was then admitted to the intensive care unit. His laboratory parameters are described in
