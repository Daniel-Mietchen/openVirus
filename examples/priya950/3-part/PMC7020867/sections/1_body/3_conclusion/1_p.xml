<p>The case presented herein suggests that DENV and CHIKV coinfection may result in myocarditis, which can be severe and may be possibly reverted with supportive therapy and correct management of cardiac function. Nevertheless, the correct etiopathogenesis of the cardiac disorder is undefined and the disease may be caused solely by either the DENV or CHIKV virus. It is important to be aware of this possible complication of arboviruses mainly in endemic areas.</p>
