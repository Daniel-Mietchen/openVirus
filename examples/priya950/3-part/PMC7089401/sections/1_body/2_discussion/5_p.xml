<p>Our results showed that the specific residues in BgV NS4A, NS4B and NS5 identified 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> were directly involved in increased infectivity and pathogenesis 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. This was revealed by comparing data from prototype-injected mice with mutant-injected mice (BgV

 <italic>vs</italic> BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>, and BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub>/WNV-prME 
 <italic>vs</italic> BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME). Our results also suggest that the BgV structural genes (prM and E) might be involved in BgV attenuation in vertebrates. Indeed, our results establish that while the BgV-prME proteins can facilitate infection in vertebrates, as shown by the data from WNV/BgV-prME inoculated mice, the insertion of these genes resulted in attenuated phenotypes compared to the corresponding viruses with WNV-prME. WNV/BgV-prME was significantly less virulent than WNV

 <sub>FLSDX</sub> all succumb to the infection after 8 days–and both versions of BgV seemed to replicate less efficiently than their BgV/WNV-prME counterpart in mice. Taken together, these comparisons suggest that BgV attenuation may be influenced by inefficient binding and/or entering to vertebrate cells, as well as reduced replication efficiency due to the key residues identified in the non-structural viral proteins.
