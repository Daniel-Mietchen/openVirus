<p>Temperature-dependent host-restriction in vertebrate cells has been shown to occur for another flavivirus, Rabensburg virus (RabV), which is a divergent strain of WNV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. RabV failed to replicate in Vero, BHK, HEK293 and DF-1 cells at 37°C, as well as in house sparrows or chickens, but was capable of replicating in frog cells incubated at 28°C [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similar to our findings with BgV, the investigators subsequently showed that RabV could replicate in vertebrate cells incubated at lower temperatures [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In a more recent study, the investigators have identified several mutations in the non-structural proteins of replication-competent variants arising as the virus was passaged in vertebrate cells at increasing temperatures [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, specific viral or host factors involved in RabV temperature-dependent host-restriction have not been identified to date.
