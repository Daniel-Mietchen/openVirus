<p>BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> was then used as a template to generate a mutated version of the prototype BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub>/WNV-prME chimera: BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME, which was confirmed to replicate in C6/36 cells with similar efficiency to prototype BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub> and BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub>/WNV-prME and to mutant BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> after 5 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This mutant chimera was created in an attempt to remove multiple BgV host-restriction factors simultaneously. Indeed, WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> prM-E proteins should provide efficient entry to the cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g002">Fig 2</xref>), while the three NS4/5 substitutions should ablate the post-entry restriction at 37°C. As expected, the mutated chimera replicated in all tested vertebrate cells (BSR, DF-1 and Vero) at 37°C to similar or slightly lower titres than mutant BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). While these 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments did not show an enhanced replication of BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME compared to BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> in the cell lines tested, further studies were required to determine if this phenotype was representative of an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> infection.
