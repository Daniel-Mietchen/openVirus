<p>We also assessed the replication efficiency of the mutant BgV viruses in DF-1 cells at 37°C to determine whether the identified mutations rescued BgV replication in cell lines other than Vero cells. As expected, prototype BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub> and NS4A mutant BgV
 <sub>T-CG</sub> replication was not detected, while double and triple mutants BgV
 <sub>C-AT</sub> and BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> replicated in DF-1 cells at 37°C, with an advantage for BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> compared to BgV
 <sub>C-AT</sub> (
