<p>In order to further define BgV host-restriction, a subset of the vertebrate cell lines tested in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> was inoculated with BgV and incubated at 34°C, instead of the usual 37°C. Notably, BgV was found to replicate at 34°C in all vertebrate cell lines tested, including those not supporting its replication at 37°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Using a thermal stability assay, we determined that this temperature-dependent host-restriction was not due to the virus being less stable at higher temperatures. Indeed, when BgV and WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> were held at various temperatures in the absence of cells over 72 hours, the infectivity of BgV was as stable or better than that of WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> at all temperatures tested (4°C, 28°C, 34°C and 37°C) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We determined a threshold of temperature for this phenotype, by passaging a C6/36-derived BgV stock onto Vero (non-permissive for BgV at 37°C) and BSR cells (permissive for BgV at 37°C) at 34°C, 35°C, 36°C and 37°C. This revealed that BgV was able to replicate in both cell lines at 34°C (10

 <sub>50</sub> IU/mL in Vero cells, 10
 <sup>4.7</sup> TCID
