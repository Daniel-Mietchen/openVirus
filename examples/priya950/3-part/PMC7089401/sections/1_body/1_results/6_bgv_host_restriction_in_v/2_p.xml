<p>In order to elucidate whether BgV temperature-dependent host-restriction was associated with the structural or non-structural genes of BgV, a replication kinetics assay was performed with BgV, WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>, WNV/BgV-prME and BgV/WNV-prME in BSR and Vero cells at 34°C and 37°C. BgV/WNV-prME and BgV replicated at 34°C and 37°C in BSR cells, with more robust growth at 34°C, but failed to produce detectable levels of progeny virus in Vero cells at 37°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In contrast, WNV/BgV-prME and WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> were able to replicate in BSR and Vero cells at both temperatures, although WNV/BgV-prME reached lower peak titres than WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> and had no discernible cytopathic effect on the cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This demonstrated that the temperature-dependent host-restriction of BgV was associated with the non-structural proteins or UTRs of this virus.
