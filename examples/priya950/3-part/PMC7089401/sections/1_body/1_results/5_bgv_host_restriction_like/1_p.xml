<p>To identify the viral factors associated with BgV host-restriction 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we assessed the ability of the chimeric viruses (WNV/BgV-prME and BgV/WNV-prME) to replicate in a selection of vertebrate cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These cell lines were chosen as representatives of BgV-permissive and BgV-non-permissive cell lines. Examination of inoculated cell monolayers by IFA revealed that similar to WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>, WNV/BgV-prME could replicate in all tested vertebrate cell lines, while BgV/WNV-prME could only replicate in OK, BSR and SW13 cells, similar to BgV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). This demonstrated that BgV host-restriction was associated with the non-structural proteins or UTRs of the virus, and likely occurred post-entry to the cells.
