<p>Histopathological examination of the brain from animals terminated on days three and five p.i. revealed minimal haemorrhage and neuropil spongiosis at the IC injection site in some animals. On day 3 p.i. one animal in each of the triple mutants BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> and BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME IC-inoculated groups had more widespread inflammation with perivascular cuffing, neuropil infiltration of neutrophils and monocytoid cells as well as gliosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). By day 5 p.i., two out of three animals in the BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME group had areas in the caudal putamen, thalamus and/or frontal part of 
 <italic>Corpus calosum</italic> of mild to moderate infiltration of monocytes and neutrophils accompanied by gliosis, spongiosis and notable leukocyte margination in small blood vessels (
