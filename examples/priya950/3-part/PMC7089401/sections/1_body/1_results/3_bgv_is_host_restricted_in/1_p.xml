<p>BgV was inoculated into various animal species to confirm its host-restricted phenotype and to complement the mouse infection data obtained previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Embryonated chicken eggs have been used extensively to culture and isolate flaviviruses and are susceptible to infection with a wide range of flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Injecting 9–12 days old embryonated eggs intravenously with BgV did not produce any visible disease except for one embryo which received 10
 <sup>4.7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> infectious units (IU) and died 120h post-injection. BgV was not detected in the homogenate of the three embryos inoculated with the lowest dose (10
 <sup>3.7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> IU/egg) or in the embryo that died. Only low levels of virus (10
 <sup>4.1–4.9</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> IU/egg) were detected in the remaining homogenates, most likely due to residual virus from the injections (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). BgV was also inoculated subcutaneously into avian, reptilian and amphibian animal models, including five house sparrows (
 <italic>Passer domesticus</italic>), six northern leopard frogs (
 <italic>Lithobates pipiens</italic>), six Texas toads (
 <italic>Anaxyrus speciosus</italic>), and six ribbon snakes (
 <italic>Thamnophis saurita</italic>). All animals were sampled for blood at multiple time points post-infection (p.i.) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). No infectious virus was detected in any serum sample at any time point. Taken together, these data show that BgV replication was not detected in avian, reptilian or amphibian models.
