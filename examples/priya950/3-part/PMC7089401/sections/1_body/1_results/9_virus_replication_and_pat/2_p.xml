<p>First, the prototype BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub> was confirmed to have the same mild phenotype as previously reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. None of the mice developed any clinical signs of disease at any stage after inoculation. We detected no seroconversion in IP-injected mice, suggesting negligible replication in peripheral tissues, but 33% of IC-injected mice had seroconverted or developed neutralising antibodies, suggesting some replication occurred in neural tissues in these mice (
