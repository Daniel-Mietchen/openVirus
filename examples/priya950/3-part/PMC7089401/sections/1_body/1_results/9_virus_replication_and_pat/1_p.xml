<p>The host-restriction of BgV was further assessed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, by inoculating 19-days old immunocompetent CD-1 mice intracranially (IC) and intraperitoneally (IP) with 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> IU of prototype and mutant BgV (BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub>, n = 31 and BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>, n = 12 respectively), prototype and mutant chimeras (BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub>/WNV-prME, n = 12 and BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME, n = 12) and the reverse chimera (WNV/BgV-pME, n = 20). Subsets of mice were terminated on days three and five p.i., respectively, and subjected to blood and tissue sampling for virus isolation and histopathology. The remaining mice were culled on day 21â€“22 p.i. and similarly subjected to blood and tissue sampling. The serum samples were used in two assays: fixed-cell ELISA and microneutralisation, to determine the levels of virus antigen-reactive and neutralising antibodies, respectively.
