<p>Mice from groups infected with the prototype and mutant BgV and BgV/WNV-prME chimeras were culled at three and five days p.i. and sampled for virus isolation (serum, brain, spleen, kidney, liver, mesenteric lymph node) in an attempt to characterise BgV viremia and replication 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Low levels of infectious virus were detected in the brains of only 33% of prototype BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub> IC-inoculated mice, while virus was re-isolated from all brains from mutant BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> and BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME IC-inoculated mice at both time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>). The virus titres were not significantly different between viruses at each time point (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). All other organs and blood samples were negative for the presence of infectious virus. These data clearly demonstrate that the substitutions in BgV NS4/5 enhance viral replication in neural tissues 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, it was unclear which organs supported virus replication in the IP-inoculated seropositive mice, or in mice IC-inoculated with BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub>/WNV-prME.
