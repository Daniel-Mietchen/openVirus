<p>All mouse experiments were performed at the University of Queenlsand in accordance with the ethical standards of the Australian Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes and were approved by the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee before commencement of the studies (permit numbers SCMB/033/15/FIMMWA, SCMB/339/16 and SCMB/028/19). To assess the ability of BgV-derived viruses to infect, replicate and produce disease in young mice, six groups of ten mice (male and female), 19 days old at start of experiment, were challenged with 10

 <sub>50</sub> IU of BgV
 <sub>Clone</sub>, and the chimeric viruses BgV/WNV-prME and WNV/BgV-prME or mock-infected 
 <italic>via</italic> either the IP or IC route. CD1 mice were used as they have an intact immune response, are outbred, and have been shown to be susceptible to flavivirus infection at these doses [

 <sub>Clone</sub> IC inoculated group succumbed to the anaesthesia. The mice were observed twice daily until day 8 post-inoculation and daily after that, until termination at day 21 post-inoculation. A second cohort was inoculated with BgV-derived viruses. Groups of twelve mice (six male and six female) were infected

 <sub>C-CG</sub>/WNV-prME or BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME. Four mice served as mock-infected controls (two mice per route). Three mice per group were terminated on days three and five p.i. and subjected to complete necropsy, blood and tissue sampling for virus isolation and histopathology (see below). The remaining six mice per group were culled on day 22 p.i. and similarly subjected to blood and tissue sampling. One BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub> IC-inoculated mouse succumbed to the anaesthesia. The mice were observed twice daily until day 13 p.i. and daily after that, until termination at day 22 p.i.. All mice were bled by cardiac puncture under ketamine/xylazine anaesthesia followed by cervical dislocation on day 21â€“22 p.i..
