<p>Coverslips were incubated for one hour at RT with blocking buffer (see above). Primary mAb at the optimal dilution in blocking buffer was added to each coverslip after removing the blocking buffer and incubated rocking at RT for one hour. Coverslips were washed with PBS-T three times and secondary antibody (Alexafluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG H+L, Invitrogen) was added at the optimal concentration in blocking buffer and incubated rocking at RT in the dark for one hour. Secondary antibody was removed and Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (Invitrogen) was added at the recommended concentration and incubated for five minutes in the dark, rocking at RT. Coverslips were washed twice with PBS-T and once with PBS and mounted on microscope slides with a drop of ProlongGold antifade (Invitrogen). Fluorescence was observed and imaged on a Zeiss microscope at a 400 or 200 times magnification. Post-processing of the raw images was performed using Microsoft Office Picture Manager (2010) and ImageJ.</p>
