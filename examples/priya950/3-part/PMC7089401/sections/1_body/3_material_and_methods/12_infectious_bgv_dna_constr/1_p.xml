<p>An infectious clone of BgV and two chimeric DNA infectious constructs were generated using CPER as described previously, with primers listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008166.s002">S1 Table</xref>, under the Institutional Biosafety Subcommittee number IBC/1178/SCMB/2018 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The chimeras created were WNV/BgV-prME containing a WNV
 <sub>FLSDX(Pro)</sub> genome backbone with the BgV prME genes and BgV/WNV-prME containing a BgV genome backbone and WNV
 <sub>FLSDX(Pro)</sub> prME genes.
