<p>The genome of WNV/BgV-prME was sequenced with the following protocol. Genomic RNA of the chimeric virus was converted into cDNA using specific primers at the 3’ end of the 3’UTR and Superscript IV reverse transcriptase (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008166.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Fragments were amplified using Q5 High Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) following manufacturer’s protocol and using virus specific primers (

The fragments were combined in equimolar amounts, quantified and sequenced at the Australian Centre for Ecogenomics (University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia). Libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). The prepared library was sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform 2*150 bp PE run with V2 chemistry. Reads were mapped to the chimera genome in Geneious 8.1.9 with default parameters.
