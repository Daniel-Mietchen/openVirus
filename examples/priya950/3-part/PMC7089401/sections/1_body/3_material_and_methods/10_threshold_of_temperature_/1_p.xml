<p>BSR and Vero cells were infected at MOI 1 with a stock of C6/36-derived BgV in T25 flasks and incubated at 34°C, 35°C, 36°C or 37°C to determine a threshold of temperature allowing for BgV replication. The supernatant of these cells was harvested and stored at -80°C before being titrated by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> on C6/36 cells, incubated at 28°C for five days, fixed in 20% acetone, 0.02% BSA in PBS and analysed by fixed-cell ELISA using 4G2.
