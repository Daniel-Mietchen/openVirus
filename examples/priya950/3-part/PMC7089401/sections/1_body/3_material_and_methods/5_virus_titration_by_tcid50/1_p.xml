<p>Cell supernatants were titrated by the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> method on C6/36 cells in 96 well plates, with 4–10 wells per 10-fold dilution [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The titration plates were incubated for 5 days at 28°C, cells were fixed in 20% acetone, 0.02% BSA in PBS and replication was assessed by fixed-cell ELISA (see below) with pan-flavivirus E-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4G2 [
