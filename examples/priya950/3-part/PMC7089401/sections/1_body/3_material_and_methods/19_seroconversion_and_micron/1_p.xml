<p>Heat-inactivated sera from all 59 mice were tested for seroconversion and cross-reactivity by fixed-cell ELISA as described above, on fixed monolayers infected with prototype BgV, WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>, BgV/WNV-prME and WNV/BgV-prME. The sera were diluted from 1/20 to 1/160 in blocking buffer by doubling dilutions. These data were not analysed for statistical significance, as in all cases, the two groups to be compared had either very low numbers of positive replicates, or were all equal to the higher limit of detection, skewing the analysis.
