<p>Five house sparrows (
 <italic>Passer domesticus</italic>), six northern leopard frogs (
 <italic>Lithobates pipiens</italic>), six Texas toads (
 <italic>Bufo spp</italic>.), and six ribbon snakes (
 <italic>Thamnophis spp</italic>.) were inoculated subcutaneously with 0.1 ml containing 1x10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> IU of BgV diluted in PBS, under Colorado State University animal ethics approval number 16-6934A. The dose chosen was higher than would be expected from the bite of a single infected mosquito, in order to have confidence that if negative results were obtained it was not due to an inadequate inoculum but also to remain realistic. This dose was similar to the one used for Zika virus in other host-restriction studies in these animals [

Blood was collected from frogs, toads and snakes on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 28 post-inoculation. Blood samples were diluted 1:5 in BA1 medium (HEPES-buffered MEM containing 1% BSA), centrifuged to remove cells, and stored at -80°C until assay. Infectious virus was assayed from all samples by inoculation of duplicate 0.1 ml aliquots of samples diluted 1:5 and 1:50, along with a BgV positive control, onto monolayers of C6/36 cells in 96 well plates. Two days later, the medium was decanted and cells fixed with 80% acetone. Virus infection of cells was assessed after immunostaining with 4G2 antibody and DyLight-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) [
