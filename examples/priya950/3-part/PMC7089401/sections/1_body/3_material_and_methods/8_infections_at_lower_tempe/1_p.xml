<p>A subset of cell lines (Vero, DF-1, MEF
 <sub>WT</sub>, MEF
 <sub>IFNAR-/-</sub>, MEF
 <sub>RNL-/-</sub>, JU56, HEK293, LLCPK1, PK15A, ST, OK, SW13, BSR) were selected to be infected with BgV at the lower temperature of 34°C. These infections were performed similarly to what has been described above, at 34°C and 37°C in parallel, in triplicates, with WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> as replicating virus control and with C6/36 cells as permissive cells control. Supernatants from these infected vertebrate cells were titrated on C6/36 cells by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> as described above and analysed in fixed-cell ELISA using 4G2. The data were plotted with average and standard deviation of the triplicate values for each sample.
