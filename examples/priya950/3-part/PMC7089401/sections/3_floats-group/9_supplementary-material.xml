  <title>Replication kinetics of BgV
   <sub>C-CG</sub> (prototype) and BgV
   <sub>T-CG</sub> (single mutant NS4A) in C6/36 (28°C), BSR and Vero cells (37°C).
  </title>
  <p>The cells were inoculated in triplicates at MOI 0.1 as above, supernatants were harvested at 2, 24, 48, 96 and 120h for C6/36 cells and at 2, 24, 72 and 120 hours p.i. for vertebrate cells, stored at -80°C, titrated on C6/36 cells and the titres determined by fixed-cell ELISA. Error bars represent the standard deviation and the dotted lines represent the lower limit of detection.</p>
