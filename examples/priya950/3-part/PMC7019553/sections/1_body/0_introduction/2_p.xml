<p>These data raise the question concerning the reliability of the Hungarian population's herd immunity. Because of recent outbreaks worldwide, not only of measles, but also mumps and rubella (MMR) infections [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and because of waning of immunity over time after vaccination [
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], there is an urgent need for reliable and affordable laboratory tests for monitoring anti-MMR antibody (IgG) titres. For this purpose, we developed a new, ‘three-in-one’ immunoassay for quick measurement of all three anti-viral antibodies within a single run. To our knowledge, this triple format of MMR ELISA is currently not available on the market. The ELISA protocol described herein incorporates our previous method [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] that has been further improved to enable the use of the same assay conditions for all three anti-viral antibodies. We demonstrate the high-throughput applicability of this assay using 1736 serum samples from patients of diverse age groups, and provide an estimation of the population-level MMR seropositivity. We present and discuss our results in the context of both assay development and immunosurvey evaluation in relation to the history of M/MMR vaccination in Hungary from 1969 to present.
