<p>Considering the antigen-specific seropositivity ratios of all samples measured, anti-measles, -mumps and -rubella IgG antibody titres were adequate in 89.84%, 91.82% and 92.28%, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>). Taking the following herd immunity threshold (HIT) values as a base; HIT
 <sub>Measles</sub> = 92–95%, HIT
 <sub>Mumps</sub> = 75–86%, HIT
 <sub>Rubella</sub> = 83–86, it can be stated that regarding measles, levels of humoral immunity may be inadequate in certain age clusters of the population. Regarding anti-measles antibodies, cumulative data (
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>total measles</sub> = 3523 serum samples) show that the lowest seropositivity (79.3%) was detected in individuals vaccinated between 1978 and 1987 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>), with significant differences from the flanking age groups vaccinated between 1969–1977 and 1988–1990 (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0015, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). For mumps (
 <italic>N</italic> = 1736 serum samples), the least protected groups were vaccinated during 1978–1987 (11.9%) and 1988–1990 (10.1%); however, these were not statistically different from the adjacent age groups. In the case of rubella (
 <italic>N</italic> = 1736 serum samples), the least protected groups were vaccinated during 1969–1977 (14.4%) and 1978–1987 (14.5%). Significant differences were observed between the group born before 1969 (not vaccinated) and vaccinated during 1969–1977 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.00008), and between groups 1988–1990 and 1991–1995 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.009).
