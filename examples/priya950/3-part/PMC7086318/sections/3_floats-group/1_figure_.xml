  <p>A Bayesian phylogenetic tree of HPeV3, including the strain isolated from our case (indicated by Kitaharima 2016) and from other areas, was constructed with the software program MrBayes v.3.4. The asterisks indicate the identified strains. The strains detected in Kagoshima and Kyoto in 2016 were isolated from adults with myalgia, whereas those from Nerima and Okinawa were isolated from infants under one year of age in 2016. The bar indicates genetic distance, the branch lengths are proportional to the differences, and the posterior probability of the branching is shown next to the nodes. GenBank accession numbers are indicated on the tips. HPeV3: human parechovirus type 3</p>
