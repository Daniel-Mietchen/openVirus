<p>Mild-to-moderate diffuse myalgia is a common symptom of any acute viral infection. In our case, however, medical attention was sought because the muscle pain was so severe that the patient was unable to get up from a chair or walk. In such cases, several differential diagnoses should be considered before concluding a simple viral infection. The etiology of myalgia can often be categorized based on the symptoms, whether they are diffuse or focal. In the present case, the patient had diffuse muscle pain predominantly in the extremities. In addition to the possibility of a systemic infection, many other potential causes were likely as well, including non-inflammatory pain syndrome, such as fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome; rheumatic disease, such as polymyalgia rheumatica; autoinflammatory disease, such as polymyositis; endocrine disorders, such as thyroid disease; adverse effects of medications; or psychiatric disorders, including depression. However, considering the patient's age, clinical data, and history, these causes were all deemed unlikely. A history of contact with his child, who had an acute respiratory infection, and the clinical symptoms of a fever and sore throat suggested that a viral infection was the most likely cause of his myalgia. Considering the extremely severe myalgia associated with a viral infection, epidemic myalgia was clinically diagnosed.</p>
