<p>In 2016, we isolated partial sequences of HPeV3 from children and adults in other regions of Japan, including Kagoshima, Kyoto, Tokyo, and Okinawa, which appear to be classified into the same cluster as demonstrated in the phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g001">Figure</xref>). This suggests that HPeV3 infection was prevalent in several areas of Japan in 2016. Reported cases of epidemic myalgia associated with HPeV3 infection confirmed by either or both PCR or an increase in neutralizing antibodies against HPeV3 are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In 2016, 13 cases of epidemic myalgia were reported. Most patients with myalgia associated with HPeV3 infection were between 20 and 40 years of age, which is the child-rearing age range. Many patients had a history of contact with their sick children or spouses, as reported in our case, although we did not isolate HPeV3 virus from the son of the present patient. Men accounted for 79% of cases; the underlying reason for this sex difference remains to be determined.
