<p>At present, the clinical reports of epidemic myalgia associated with HPeV3 are limited to a few areas in Japan. One potential reason for this may be, at least in part, due to the lack of awareness of this disease and/or access to virological analyses. However, it is still unclear why such severe cases have been exclusively reported from Japan. The phylogenetic tree shows 31 sequences, including 13 European (42%), 14 Asian (45%), 3 Australian (10%), and 1 African (3%), and the strains do not show much variation, indicating that a potential viral adaptation exclusive to the Japanese population is unlikely to be the reason. One possible explanation is genetically determined differences between Japanese individuals and those from other countries in the degree of the IL-6 response to severe stress. Indeed, polymorphisms within the 5 flanking region of
