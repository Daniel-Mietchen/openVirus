<p>In conclusion, we presented the case of a patient with epidemic myalgia associated with HPeV3 infection in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. The sudden onset of extreme pain in the extremities, which made it difficult for the patient to stand or walk, accompanied by a fever, sore throat, and orchiodynia, resembled the characteristic clinical presentation of HPeV3-associated epidemic myalgia. Owing to the spread of HPeV3 infection among children in various areas in Japan, HPeV3-associated epidemic myalgia should be considered when patients present with such severe symptoms in a clinical context. Furthermore, tracking the prevalence of HPeV3-associated epidemic myalgia in various areas of Japan is important for improving the public health response during an outbreak of this disease.</p>
