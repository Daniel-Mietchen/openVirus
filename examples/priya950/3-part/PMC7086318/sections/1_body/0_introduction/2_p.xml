<p>HPeV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Thus far, more than 10 genotypes of HPeV have been identified (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). HPeV1 and HPeV2 were previously known as echovirus 22 and echovirus 23, respectively, and have been now reclassified as members of 
 <italic>Parechovirus</italic>. HPeV3 was first identified in 2004 from a one-year-old child with transient paralysis, a fever, and diarrhea in Japan (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). HPeV infections, such as those associated with HPeV1, HPeV2, and HPeV4-8, mostly cause mild gastroenteritis and respiratory infections early in life; however, HPeV3 infection is associated with more serious illnesses, such as sepsis-like syndrome or encephalitis as well as mild gastroenteritis and respiratory infections in neonates and young infants (
