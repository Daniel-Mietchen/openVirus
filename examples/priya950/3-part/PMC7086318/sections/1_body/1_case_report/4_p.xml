<p>Epidemic myalgia caused by HPeV3 infection was suspected on the basis of the predominant pain in his limbs as well as symptoms related to acute upper respiratory infection and orchiodynia (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), although we did not further evaluate the testis because no physical findings, such as redness or swelling, were observed in the scrotum. To confirm the diagnosis of epidemic myalgia associated with HPeV3 infection, a part of the viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence was amplified from serum samples collected on the second day after admission and from throat swabs and stool samples collected on the third day after admission. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequencing analysis was performed after obtaining informed consent from the patient. First, RNA was extracted from the samples and used to synthesize first-strand complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA). Subsequently, nested PCR was performed to amplify the junctional region of capsid-protein encoding VP3 and VP1 using a method described by Harvala et al. (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The amplified PCR product was sequenced by Sanger's method using the same primers used for nested PCR. The sequence analysis identified the same 250-base pair (bp) sequences from all samples. A Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search revealed that these fragments were 98% identical to the sequences of other HPeV3.
