<p>A 42-year-old man presented to the Department of Internal Medicine of our hospital in a wheelchair owing to extremely severe muscle pain and weakness, primarily in the arms and legs, in July 2016. The pain was so severe that he was unable to stand and walk; therefore, he was admitted to our hospital. He had been well until two days before this presentation, when he began to experience sore throat and muscle pain. Approximately two weeks before the appearance of these symptoms, his three-year-old son had presented with an acute upper respiratory infection, which improved within a few days. The patient had no history of medication or allergies.</p>
