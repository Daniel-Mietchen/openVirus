<p>We estimated HIV-1 transmission flows within and between the FF and GP study participants, while accounting for slightly different sequence sampling fractions of HIV-1 positive participants. Overall, transmission was assortative within the FF and GP participants, with an estimated assortativity coefficient of 0.32 (95% CrI 0.10–0.53). More specifically, the estimated transmission flows when same-sex pairs were included are listed in 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00331-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> column five, and the estimated transmission flows when same-sex pairs were excluded are listed in 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00331-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> column six. Within and between groups of study participants, the estimated HIV-1 transmission flows were 45.5% (95% credibility interval (CrI) 34.1–57.0%) from FF to FF, 12.7% (95% CrI 6.1–21.3%) from FF to GP, 19.5% (95% CrI 11.4–29.3%) from GP to FF, and 22.3% (95% CrI 13.4–32.7%) from GP to GP in the analysis excluding same-sex pairs. The estimated flows were significantly different when same-sex pairs were excluded, because 20 (95.2%) of 21 same-sex source–recipient pairs were within the GP. All phylogenetically reconstructed transmissions between GP and FF locations involved a male and a female, and so there were more transmissions from GP to FF locations compared to the opposite direction regardless of excluding same-sex source–recipient pairs. The estimated flow ratio of transmission flows from GP to FF divided by flows from FF to GP was 1.56 (95% CrI 0.68–3.72).
