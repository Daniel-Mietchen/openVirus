<p>Considering gender, 50 (47.6%) source–recipient pairs were male to female, 12 (11.4%) were male to male, 24 (22.9%) were female to male, 10 (9.5%) were female to female among WHR, and 9 (8.6%) were female to female and involved at most one WHR (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00331">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Observing male–male pairs was not significantly more likely than observing female–female pairs outside WHR. Thus, the most likely explanation for the presence of phylogenetically linked same-sex pairs is that intermediate individuals or common source cases of the opposite gender remained unsampled. In particular, there was only 1 male–female pair among the 13 highly supported source–recipient pairs that involved WHR, suggesting that a substantial number of WHR male clients were not captured in our populations. Due to this under-sampling of male clients, pairs from the WHR population were excluded from the subsequent HIV-1 transmission flow analysis. Column four in
