<p>We next estimated the sources of HIV-1 acquisition among the FF and GP study participants after adjusting for sequence sampling differences (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00331-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For any HIV-1 infection found in the FF sample, the probability that it originated from other FF was 70.4% (95% CrI 56.2–81.9%), and the probability that it originated from the GP was 29.6% (95% CrI 18.1–43.8%) when same-sex pairs were excluded. For any HIV-1 infection found in the GP sample, the probability that it originated from the GP was 80.2% (95% CrI 66.8–90.0%), and the probability that it originated from the FF was 19.8% (95% CrI 10.0–33.2%) when same-sex pairs were excluded.
