<p>A total of 123 HIV-1 transmission networks were reconstructed with phyloscanner, of which 101 (82.1%) comprised of 2 individuals, 20 (16.3%) comprised of 3–5 individuals, 0 comprised 6–10 individuals, and 2 (1.6%) comprised of &gt;10 individuals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00331-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). In larger networks, pairs of individuals between whom linkage was not excluded had larger subgraph distances (median distances were 0.5% in networks of size 2, 0.6% in networks of size 3–5, and 2.1% in networks of size &gt;10; see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00331">Table S1</xref>), suggesting that in larger networks, slightly more phylogenetic distant individuals were connected. In the reconstructed transmission networks, a total of 105 source–recipient pairs with strong support for phylogenetic linkage and direction of transmission were identified based on the criteria described under methods. Further analysis was restricted to these highly supported source–recipient pairs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00331-f003">Figure 3</xref>b illustrates one of the largest identified networks. In the figure, source–recipient pairs are highlighted with arrows in black. No arrows were drawn when the corresponding two individuals were classified as phylogenetically unlinked in at least 60% of deep-sequence phylogenies across the genome.
