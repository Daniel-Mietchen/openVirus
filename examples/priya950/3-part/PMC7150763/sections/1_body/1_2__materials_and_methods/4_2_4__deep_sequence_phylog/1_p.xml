<p>We used phyloscanner version 1.8.0 to reconstruct directed HIV-1 transmission networks from deep sequences [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Briefly, phyloscanner analysis starts with HIV deep-sequence reads from a set of infected individuals that are mapped against reference sequences of the entire genome. Across the genome, sliding windows are defined, and for each window, paired-end reads from all individuals that overlap the window are extracted and aligned, and deep-sequence phylogenies reconstructed. In our analysis, windows were of length 250 bp and incremented by 25 bp across the entire genome. Next, viral lineages in the deep-sequence phylogenies were attributed to each individual using maximum parsimony ancestral state reconstruction, which defined larger parts (called “subgraphs”) of the deep-sequence phylogenies that are attributed to viral evolution within each individual. Using Sanger sequencing, typically one sequence is available per person, and in this case, each subgraph consists of the tip sequence only that corresponds to the sampled individual. Using deep-sequence data, subgraphs of each individual typically comprise several tips and inner nodes in the phylogeny, and this information can be used to characterize the relationship of individuals in terms of distance between subgraphs and topological relationship between subgraphs.

The subgraph distances are used to infer phylogenetic linkage, and the subgraph topologies are used to infer the likely direction of transmission between individuals (

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The scores indicate the proportion of genomic windows with phylogenetic support for linkage and transmission direction, after accounting for overlap between the read alignments.
