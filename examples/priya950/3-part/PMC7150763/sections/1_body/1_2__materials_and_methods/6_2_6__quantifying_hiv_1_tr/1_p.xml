<p>We used the phyloflows package, version 1.1.0, implemented in the R software [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] to quantify HIV-1 transmission flows within and between the three populations, while adjusting for sampling heterogeneity across our study populations. Briefly, a Bayesian model was used to estimate transmission flows in population groups under the assumption that each group was sampled at random, but with potentially different sampling rates [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was used to obtain samples from the posterior distribution of transmission flows, was run for 50,000 iterations, and the initial 5% were discarded as burn-in. Convergence was assessed with the Gelmanâ€“Rubin statistic [
