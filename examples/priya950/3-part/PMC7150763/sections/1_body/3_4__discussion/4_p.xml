<p>This study has limitations. First, individuals were recruited in health care facilities and during VCT campaigns, and so this study did not include infected individuals who had not yet linked to care. Second, our convenience sample preferentially included infected individuals from FF populations, rendering it challenging to extrapolate transmission flow estimates from study participants to the population the participants were recruited from. However, the flow ratio statistics in

 <xref rid="viruses-12-00331-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> are invariant to differential sampling of population groups, and can thus be used to characterize population-level HIV-1 spread. Third, few WHR male clients were recruited, and we were not able to substantiate the transmission probabilities from this population as a source of infections. Recruitment of male clients and partners of WHR in the parent study was challenging due to stigma or other unknown socio-behavioral factors that the men in this group associated with study participation. We observed from our socio-demographic data that WHR were a mobile group of individuals who interacted with high-risk male individuals in the GP and FF particularly during peak seasons of high fish stock, suggesting that a non-negligible proportion of infections may originate from WHR. Fourth, virus from less than 50% of enrolled participants could be deep-sequenced, excluding those that did not have sufficient viraemia for HIV-1 nucleic acid amplification and deep sequencing. Our sample comprised study participants who were ART naïve or on therapy with unsuppressed virus, and it is possible that transmissions from individuals who reached viral suppression soon after infection are under-represented in our data. Generation of additional HIV-1 deep sequence data based on sequencing protocols that amplify proviral HIV-1 DNA or sequence virus from low viraemic specimens [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] is a consideration for our future analyses. Fifth, transmissions including individuals with co-infections may have been excluded by the definition of source–recipient pairs. It is important to note that while the FF communities investigated in this study were net recipients for viral transmission (sinks) from GP population groups, the possibility of fishing villages being sources of HIV-1 transmission to other populations cannot be ruled out.
