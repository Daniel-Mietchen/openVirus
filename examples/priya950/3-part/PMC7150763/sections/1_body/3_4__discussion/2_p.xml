<p>We found a substantial number of viral introductions into FF communities. Considering that participants were disproportionally recruited in FF populations, we expect that the estimated proportion of GP infections in the sample attributable to GP sources (80.2%) is a lower bound of the proportion of infections in the GP population that is attributable to GP sources. Similarly, we expect that the estimated proportion of FF infections in the sample attributable to FF sources (70.4%) is an upper bound of the proportion of infections in the FF population that is attributable to FF sources. In a study done in Rakai [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], differences in survey sampling were adjusted for, and the estimated proportion of FF infections attributable to FF sources was 54.8% (95% CrI 42.2â€“69.0%). Thus, taken together, the two studies indicate very high levels of viral introductions to the HIV-1 epidemic in FF populations for the duration of both studies, from August 2011 to August 2017.
