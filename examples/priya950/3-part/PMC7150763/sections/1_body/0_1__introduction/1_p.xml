<p>In 2019, the Joint United Nations program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) reported an estimated 1.4 million people that were living with HIV-1 in Uganda [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite significant decreases in HIV-1 prevalence and incidence since the early 1990s, the epidemic in Uganda remains self-sustaining through heterosexual transmission in the general population (GP) [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Certain key populations in Uganda are particularly affected by HIV-1. These include fisherfolk (FF), women at high risk of HIV-1 infection (WHR), men who have sex with men, injection drug users, as well as men and women of the uniformed forces [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], while incidence rates among FF and WHR are respectively estimated at 6/100 PYAR [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Individuals in these groups also have a higher tendency to engage in high-risk sexual behavior, which led to the hypothesis that they may drive HIV-1 transmission in general, and sustain transmission in the GP [
