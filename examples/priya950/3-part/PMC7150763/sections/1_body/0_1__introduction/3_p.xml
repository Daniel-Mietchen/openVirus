<p>Here, we test the finding that FF communities are net sinks and not sources of local transmission flow on an independent data set that includes a larger set of fishing villages. In addition, we aim to assess the extent to which key populations (FF and WHR) and socio-demographic factors contribute to the HIV-1 epidemic in the GP. To this end, the Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute and London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (MRC/UVRI and LSHTM) Uganda Research Unit team enrolled HIV-1 infected individuals in fishing villages along the shores of Lake Victoria, neighboring inland areas (approximately 10â€“40 km) and hotspots of women engaged in high-risk sexual behavior (see

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] generated HIV-1 deep-sequences from this convenience sample of infected individuals. The deep-sequence data was then used to reconstruct viral phylogenetic transmission networks that contained information on the direction of transmission. Pairs with phylogenetically highly supported evidence for the direction of transmission were identified in the networks, and these pairs were used to quantify HIV-1 transmission flows between the GP, FF, and WHR populations. In doing so, this study also demonstrates that HIV deep-sequence data can now be routinely used to reconstruct HIV-1 transmission networks, and provide important information on the direction of transmission within them.
