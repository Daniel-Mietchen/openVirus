<p>UNAIDS and the WHO have recommended that countries develop combination HIV-1 intervention packages that are tailored to their high-risk/key populations in order to curb the HIV-1 epidemic in a cost-effective manner [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To achieve this, several strategies have been suggested. These include spatial mapping to identify geographic areas of higher-than-average HIV-1 prevalence [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and demographic surveillance to characterize populations that are at higher risk of HIV-1 infection [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recent studies in Uganda have employed spatial mapping and demographic surveillance prior to the implementation of combination interventions in high-risk populations like FF [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and WHR [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, phylogenetic analyses have been increasingly used to characterize aspects of HIV-1 transmission dynamics from nucleotide sequences of the virus. For instance, phylogenetic analysis helped to reconstruct the historical spread of HIV-1 [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], characterize HIV-1 transmission networks [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], identify traits associated with onward viral transmission in high-risk groups [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and evaluate HIV-1 migration patterns [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In combination with sociodemographic or epidemiological data, these approaches have provided useful insights in assessing risk factors associated with HIV-1 spread [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and identifying micro-epidemics [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], thus informing prevention strategies. Furthermore, they have been applied in source-attribution studies to assess the role of viral introductions from other communities [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and to identify populations that serve as sinks or sources for HIV-1 transmission [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In particular, we previously estimated that high-prevalence FF communities located in central and southwestern Uganda are net recipients (sinks) of local HIV-1 transmission flow, based on phylogeographic analysis of 208 subtype A and 177 subtype D consensus sequences [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A second analysis estimated that there were 2.50 times (95% credibility interval (95%CrI) 1.02â€“7.30) more transmissions from inland to fishing areas than vice versa, based on a sample of 2652 viral deep-sequences and after accounting for human migration dynamics [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The two studies thus showed that the relatively small FF communities around Lake Victoria are not driving the surrounding HIV-1 epidemics regardless of their high HIV-1 prevalence.
