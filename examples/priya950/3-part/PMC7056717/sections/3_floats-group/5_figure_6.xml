  <p>Guinea pigs immunized by EBOV VLPs are protected against a high dose lethal challenge. As outlined in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, guinea pigs were challenged by i.p. injection of 1000 pfu guinea pig-adapted EBOV at 22 weeks after the third immunization. Guinea pigs were monitored daily and weighed on indicated days post-challenge for recording of weight changes after challenge, and animals that exhibit substantial weight loss and signs of severe disease were sacrificed in accordance with IACUC guidelines.
