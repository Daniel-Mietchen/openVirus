<p id="p0135">Different studies suggest that the first life forms appeared about 4100 million years ago, at the end of the Hadean eon and during the Archean eon. These primitive life forms apparently possessed well-organized molecular structures called LACA (last archaeal common ancestor) and could have been given in an environment in the absence of oxygen, hyperthermophilic and later thermophilic, which is compatible with the conditions of the planet during that time. There is not a well-defined moment for the appearance of LACA, it is even suggested that it could have been the same LUCA (last universal common ancestor), or it could have originated from eukaryotic cells (
