<p id="p0140">Approximately 2400 million years ago, during the Proterozoic eon, there was an increase in oxygen levels in the oceans and in the atmosphere, in an event known as Great Oxygenation Event. This change favored the appearance of the first eukaryotes; oxygen levels were increasing, and about 750 million years ago during the eon Phanero, there was a new event known as Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event that led to the appearance of the first organisms multicellular (

But it has been difficult to demonstrate conclusively, since no fossil elements have been found, which allow establishing the exact moment of evolution in which infectious diseases appeared throughout the evolutionary process. However, the etiological agents that produce diseases can be the result of a complex coevolutionary process. Interactions between host, infectious agents, and immunity have determined the epidemiological dynamics, which has played an important role at the evolutionary level. The coevolution of viruses and the host defense system may have been a determining factor in the evolution of both viruses and their hosts (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Mideo et al., 2011</xref>). The emergence of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, with a high impact on morbidity and mortality throughout history, has been the result of the interaction of multiple environmental factors and the genetic pressure exerted by microorganisms and their hosts in both pathways.
