<p id="p0145">The eons correspond to the periods of time in which the history of the earth is divided, from its detailed study, the events that have occurred can be ordered in respect to the history of the planet. The determination of the beginning and end of an aeon is carried out, thanks to the eonotemas (set of rock strata or sediments that have been formed during this period of geological time and which reflect the geological and biological events that have taken place). The divisions of the time of highest rank are the eons (Hadean, Archaic, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic), of lower rank are the periods, and even of lower rank, the epochs.
