 <italic>EÃ³n Hadeico</italic>, started about 4.567 million years ago, when the earth was formed and collided with another celestial object protoplaneta called Tea, giving rise to the Moon. An important fraction of material must has been vaporized in this impact, creating an atmosphere of vaporized rocks around the earth. The condensation of the vaporized rocks took approximately 2000 years, leaving a heavy atmosphere of carbon dioxide with hydrogen and water vapor, which gave rise to oceans of liquid water. This eon ended about 4 billion years ago.
