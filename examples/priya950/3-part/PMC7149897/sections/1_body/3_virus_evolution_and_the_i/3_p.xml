<p id="p0260">The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system has been proposed as an adaptive immune system of prokaryotes, which incorporates a specific immunological memory in the form of short DNA sequences; acquired from foreign genetic elements (spacers) and uses this memory to direct them to their corresponding target sequences (protospacers) during the next infection. CRISPR can lead to a rapid increase in the arms race (ARMS RACES) between bacteria and phages, in which evolutionary and population dynamics occur on the same timescale (
