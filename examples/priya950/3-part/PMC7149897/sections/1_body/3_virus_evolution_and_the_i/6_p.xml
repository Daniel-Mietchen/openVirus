<p id="p0275">The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is crucial for the adaptive immune response of vertebrates and is among the most polymorphic gene families known. Its high diversity is usually attributed to the selection imposed by rapidly evolving pathogens. The new MHC alleles, introduced through mutation, recombination, or gene flow, are predicted to give the host superior resistance (
