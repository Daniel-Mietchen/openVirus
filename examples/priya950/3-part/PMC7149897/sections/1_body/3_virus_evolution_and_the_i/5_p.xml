<p id="p0270">The recombination processes allow the viruses to evade the CRISPR system more effectively than point mutations. The CRISPR immune system imposes selective pressure on the phages and, in the same way, they also exert a selective pressure on the bacteria. The effectiveness of the CRISPR system has a direct impact on the fitness of the bacteria, taking into account that this is surrounded by multiple strains of phages and their survival depends on the ability to recognize them by the CRISPR system, and these will have a greater chance of survival. On the other hand, phages may present mutations that allow them to evade recognition by the CRISPR system, but studies suggest that recombination events could be more effective in this evasion, contributing to a greater degree to the evolutionary process to avoid the CRISPR system (
