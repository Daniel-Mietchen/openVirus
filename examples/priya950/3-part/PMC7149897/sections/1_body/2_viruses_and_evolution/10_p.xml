<p id="p0215">In a recent genome-wide structural phylogenomic analysis, we have shown that large-to-medium-sized viruses coevolved with cellular ancestors and have chosen the evolutionary reductive route. Phylogenetic analyses based on structural genomics and evolutionary bioinformatics have shown that viruses sized large to medium have coevolved with cellular ancestors and have chosen the evolutionary reducing pathway. The results suggest important phases in the evolution of viruses: (1) origin of the primordial cells and coexistence with cellular ancestors (
