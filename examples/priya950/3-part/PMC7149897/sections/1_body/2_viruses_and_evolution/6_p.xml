<p id="p0195">The ubiquitous existence of viruses that infect members of the three cell domains is a suggestion that the cell lineage of the Last Universal Common Ancestor, or the Last Universal Cellular Ancestor (LUCA), and of the other cell lineages that lived in the Archean eon (3.5 billion years ago) were already victims of viral attacks. In fact, it is feasible that the viruses originated before LUCA, when the cells still had genomes made up of RNA and not DNA (
