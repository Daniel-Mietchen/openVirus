<p id="p0225">The virocell possibly coexisted with the evolution of cell lineages. This ancient lineage was unable to retain most of the translation machinery and never developed the biosynthesis of ribosomal proteins, since ribosomal proteins and rRNA are absent in viruses. This genome was probably an integral component that was compartmentalized. The phylogenomic data also indicate that the major proteins of the capsid and other proteins necessary for viral pathogenicity were acquired late, after the appearance of LUCA and LUCELLA at least 1.3 billion years ago. This is an alternative view in which the appearance of the capsid coincides with the appearance of modern cells and viral adaptations to parasitism. From this moment, the archaic virocell began to acquire additional structures necessary to infect the descendants of LUCELLA (
