<p id="p0240">However, up to now, there are no identifiable “universal” viral genes that are common to similar viruses, ubiquitous cellular genes. In other words, there are no examples of common viral components that are analogous to ribosomal RNA genes and ribosomal protein genes, which are common to cellular genomes. This is a convincing reason that the phylogenetic tests of the “common viral ancestry” hypothesis seem to be inconclusive (
