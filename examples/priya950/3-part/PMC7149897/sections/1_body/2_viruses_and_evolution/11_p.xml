<p id="p0220">The use of protein structural domains and particularly the families of fold domains has proven to be useful and reliable in global phylogenetic studies. These protein folding structures are more conserved than the genetic sequences, which are highly variable and usually cannot contain deep historical evidence. The analysis of 304 families of structural fold domains of viral proteomes that included 229 of Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya showed that the majority (&gt;50%) of these “universal” fold superfamilies were of ancient origin when they were plotted in an evolutionary time line obtained from phylogenies of protein domains. Older structures were important for metabolism and translation, suggesting a primitive cellular origin of the viruses. From this perspective, it is proposed that LUCA originated at least two descendants, LUCELLA (last universal cellular ancestor) the last universal ancestor of cells that developed ribosomes and advanced protein biosynthesis (ribocells) and virocell the ancestor of a cell lineage that never deployed the ribosomal machinery and finally transformed into viral parasites and modern virocells (
