<p id="p0200">If viruses were already present in the biosphere when LUCA was existent, it would be expected to find some common features among the viruses that now infect the members of the different domains. This is the case for some archaeal viruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryotes that share homologous proteins of the capsid or ATPases, or both, which suggests that they all evolved from a common virus that existed at the time of LUCA or even earlier. Therefore the viruses are very old, and the ancestral virosphere was probably already diverse and abundant in the times of LUCA (
