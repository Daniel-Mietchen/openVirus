<p id="p0285">The bracoviruses were maintained only in the chromosomes of their associated wasp. Each bracovirus and its wasps act together as a single genomic entity that shares the same evolutionary history. So that their speciation events are contemporary, therefore, to build the phylogenetic tree of DNA insect virus, age was used, based on the age of the amber fossil of the wasps belonging to the bracovirus carrying the microgastroid complex. Using this information, it was possible to establish that the ancient baculovirus, nudivirus, and bracovirus insect viruses appeared possibly 350 million years ago in the Paleozoic era in the Carboniferous period, when insects and crustaceans were already believed to have appeared 400 million years ago. It is important to note that in the carboniferous period the holometabolic insects with larval stages and complete metamorphosis appeared (
