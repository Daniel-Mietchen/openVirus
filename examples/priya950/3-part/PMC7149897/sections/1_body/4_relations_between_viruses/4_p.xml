<p id="p0295">The appearance of pathogenic RNA viruses is often associated with their genomic plasticity and alterations in the environment that lead to new contacts with the host. Nearly 50 new human pathogens have been identified, with a predominance of RNA viruses, many as a result of introductions in human populations transferred mostly from other species (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Domingo and Holland, 1997</xref>). Transferences between species usually mediate the appearance of pathogens through the stochastic generation of virus variants capable of replicating in a new host, in the appropriate ecological environment. Several RNA viruses, including HIV (
