<p id="p0280">Insects have a special role in our understanding of viral evolution and how they became pathogens. Insects are taxonomically a diverse group of organisms and are common eukaryotic hosts for viruses. Paleontology has helped to explain the host–virus relationship of insects, on the basis of the possible or particular singularity of the obligatory symbiotic viruses of some braconid parasitic wasps. These circular dsDNA viruses, related to insects, are the nudivirus, the genus 
 <italic>Bracovirus</italic> and the families Baculoviridae and Hytrosaviridae. All of them are exclusively pathogenic for arthropods, which harbor nucleocapsids wrapped in rod form and replicate in the nucleus. Phylogenetic studies clearly show that nudivirus and baculovirus are very close groups (
