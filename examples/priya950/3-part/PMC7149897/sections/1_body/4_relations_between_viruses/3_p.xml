<p id="p0290">By relating the large-scale evolutionary history of the large DNA viruses of insects with their hosts, it is possible to observe that the ancestors of the baculovirus and nudivirus lineages infected the evolved ancestors of their existing hosts, suggesting a coevolutionary scenario of colonization in which the insect viruses had as survival resources the same insects but without destroying them. When the insects evolved into new species, they provided an evolutionarily modified form of the ecological niche required for the cycle of replication of the virus, which adapted and colonized the new host. This mechanism of ecological speciation eventually produced new species of virus. In the evolutionary timescale, with the extinction of many phylogenetic lineages of the host insects and the viruses, the genes of the viruses were maintained, so a very large cophylogenetic divergence should not be expected (
