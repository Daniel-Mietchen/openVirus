<p id="p0300">For most RNA viruses, it is not clear whether the expansion of the host range involves adaptation to new hosts or preexisting infections. For example, phylogenetic analysis indicates that DENV arose through a transfer of nonhuman primates to human hosts (

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Holmes and Twiddy, 2003</xref>). Given similar selection pressures and rates of evolution shared by other RNA arboviruses, evidence from the DENV studies suggests that the emergence of other arboviral pathogens through adaptation for urban transmission is also possible.
