<p id="Par49">Interestingly HIF-1α-knockout macrophages show decreased expression of iNOS after IFNγ stimulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>], indicating the possible involvement of HIF-1α in influenza pathogenesis. It has been shown that infection of H5N1 and 1918 viruses induces higher levels of NO in mice compared to the seasonal H1N1 virus and, as a result, they develop more intense pathogenic outcomes, while mice with iNOS deficiency showed reduced morbidity, mortality, and cytokine production in the lungs following H5N1 and 1918 virus infection. Also, systemic administration of NOS inhibitor could postpone weight loss and death among 1918 virus-infected mice [

In another survey, the delivery of NO to influenza-infected mice could not improve the lung infection and survival of mice, indicating that NO administration was not a suitable treatment strategy for influenza although this was probably due to the difficulty of determining concentrations of NO that are both viricidal and safe in host airways [

 <italic>S</italic>-nitroso-
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) reduces the replication of influenza virus in a dose-dependent manner. The production of NO in airway epithelial cells can lead to antiviral rather than harmful effects following influenza infection provided that its production is precisely controlled [
