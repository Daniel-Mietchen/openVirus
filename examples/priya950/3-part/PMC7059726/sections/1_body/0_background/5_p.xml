<p id="Par29">Furthermore, oxidative stress following infection can induce the transcription factor NF-kB, which subsequently leads to increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, IFN, and TNF [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. IFNs are one of these cytokines that trigger and affect T cell metabolism via mediating glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lipid synthesis. IFN can also exert its function on metabolic changes by producing several mediators including indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and nitric oxide (NO), both of which appear to have either an inducible or an inhibitory role in viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Since tryptophan is critical for T cell proliferation, depletion of this amino acid by IDO suppresses the immune system through the stimulation of T regulatory cells. NO, on the other hand, inhibits viral replication via changes in the structure of viral proteins [

In this review, we first discuss the metabolic abnormalities during influenza infection and then shed light on the role of immunometabolites that regulate cellular metabolism. The following sections summarize recent evidence about the novel therapeutic approaches that target metabolic pathways in influenza infection.
