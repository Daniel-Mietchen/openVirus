<p id="Par44">L-tryptophan is one of the nine essential amino acids with a remarkable role in immunosuppression and tolerance and is also essential in protein, kynurenine, and serotonin synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. IDO is an intracellular enzyme that induces production of kynurenine from L-tryptophan, thereby acting to deplete tryptophan and modulate the immune system following viral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. Having two IFN-stimulated response elements and three IFNγ-activated sites in the promoter of IDO, IFNγ acts as the most powerful inducer of IDO1 expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. IDO has also been shown to be expressed during influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. Dendritic cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells can express IDO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>], and since the primary target for replication of influenza is primarily found to be respiratory epithelial cells, understanding the role of IDO during influenza infection is of particular importance. There exists a coincidence of peak IDO1 and IFN-k expression during influenza infection. Also, mouse lung airways considerably express IFN type I and III following infection with influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>]. These findings emphasize that there is upregulated expression and enhanced function of IDO during influenza infection, which is found to be induced by IFN-I. Moreover, IFN-I is thought to signal the adjacent cells via IFN-IR and stimulate them to produce IDO [
