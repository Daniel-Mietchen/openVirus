<p id="Par27">Influenza infection actively provokes the pro-oxidant condition in the host cell to facilitate viral proliferation and pathogenesis. Increased expression of influenza M2 protein can activate protein kinase C and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, PB1-F2 decreases superoxide anion dismutase 1 (SOD1) expression and consequently disrupts the ROS scavenging process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In people with influenza infection, increased levels of DNA, lipid, and protein oxidation products are found in plasma and urine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Also, increased levels of ROS and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) have been observed as markers of oxidative stress in the lungs of people who died due to pandemic influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. ROS-producing enzymes induced by influenza infection mainly include NADPH oxidase (Nox) and xanthine oxidase, upregulation of which causes the impaired defensive function of antioxidants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. An increase in ROS production, along with impaired antioxidant function, ultimately leads to a profound change in redox homeostasis of the cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Nox2 is a phagocytic enzyme that is involved in the production of ROS induced by influenza virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and impaired Nox2 expression results in a lack of increased RNS and ROS production following influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Xanthine oxidase is also an ROS-producing enzyme that is induced by influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and its inhibition can hinder ROS increase in the cell.
