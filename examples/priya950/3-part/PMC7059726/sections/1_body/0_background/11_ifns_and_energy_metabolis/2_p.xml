<p id="Par40">There is a strong consensus that influenza replication is crucially dependent on fatty acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], which makes it a fascinating target for therapeutic modalities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Thus, the ability of IFN to channel the FAs from biosynthesis to catabolism via fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is currently known as a promising antiviral strategy in pDCs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>], which requires further research for more elucidation. Several lines of current evidence have revealed the antiviral activity of type I IFN to be exerted through hampering glucose-derived cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. Sterol regulatory binding protein 2 (SREBP2), along with SREBP1, is known as the leading transcription factor which orchestrates the biosynthesis pathway of sterol, whose inhibited transcription and expression can be strongly mediated by IFNs via IFNAR1 [
