<p id="Par42">In contrast, IL-1β (rs16944) (GG) and IL-28 (rs8099917) GG and TG genotypes were associated with reduced risk of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. In another study, an association between IL-1β rs16944 and IL-17 rs2275913 genotypes and severe influenza disease was found while IL-10 rs1800872 and IL-28 rs8099917 polymorphisms were not associated with influenza disease. Also, lacking an A allele in IL-17 rs2275913 could increase the risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Such polymorphisms in immune system genes may be associated with some metabolic changes and, in turn, may reinforce the metabolic disorders following influenza infection. However, additional studies are needed in this field to confirm or reject this opinion.
