<p id="Par33">In addition to the above-mentioned metabolic pathways, the influenza virus exhibits disruptive effects on some other metabolic processes, which gives rise to metabolic disorders and ATP crisis. Previous studies have found that the influenza infection increases the cellular synthesis of fatty acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], with some of their derivatives, including eicosanoids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], and these molecules are natural endogenous ligands and stimulators of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. PPARs are a group of nuclear receptor proteins that act as transcription factors and regulate the expression of different genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] involved in cellular differentiation and metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Furthermore, all types of PPARs discovered so far are able to suppress the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme (known as a catalyzer of the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate leading to acetyl-CoA production) in various organs through the upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. In this respect, extremely low PDH enzyme activity has been found after influenza infection in vitro. Enhanced PDK4-mediated inhibition of PDH has been found in the lung tissue of influenza-infected mice. This enzyme inhibition contributes to an erroneous process, which causes significant disruption of glucose oxidation, cellular respiration, and lipid metabolism (Fig.
