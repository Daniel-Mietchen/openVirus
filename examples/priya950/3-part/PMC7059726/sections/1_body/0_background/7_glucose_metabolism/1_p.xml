<p id="Par31">The metabolism and concentration of glucose in the cell play a cardinal role in the homeostasis of cellular metabolic procedures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Shortly after the onset of IVI, the rate of glucose uptake by infected cells increases continually, and the subsequently enhanced glycolysis results in higher glucose consumption, production of viral particles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and extracellular concentration of lactate. The relationship between glycolysis and IVI has shown that influenza infection at a higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) raises the glycolytic activity of the cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In a study by Kohio and Adamson, a dose-specific increase in influenza infection was associated with higher glucose levels, whereas the treatment of cells with glycolysis inhibitors remarkably suppressed the viral replication. However, the viral infection could be retriggered by adding ATP to the cell environment. This study revealed that enhancing vacuolar-type ATPase (a proton pump essential for influenza uncoating) via increasing glucose metabolism and, as a result, higher available ATP resources, augments the virus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The observations, as mentioned above, reveal a significant increase in ATP and glucose consumption within cells following influenza infection and also highlight the dependence of the influenza virus on the glycolysis pathway for energy production. The viral replication has the highest use of ATP during influenza infection, releasing large quantities of energy in the form of heat. This process can increase the temperature of infected cells by 4–5 °C. As viral proliferation increases, the cellular ATP level drops sharply, resulting in reduced potential and stability of the mitochondrial membrane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Based on available results, patients with metabolic disorders can develop more severe influenza infection compared to healthy hosts. There have been several studies showing that diabetes can increase the risk of influenza infection, the severity of the disease, and the fatal consequences of this infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. About 90% of patients with type 2 diabetes are overweight, and obesity is a significant risk factor for severe influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This reinforcing effect of diabetes on influenza may be due to the inhibitory effect of hyperglycemia on the immune system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. It has been shown that this hyperglycemia-associated immunosuppression and susceptibility to influenza infection can be alleviated by insulin administration and diabetes control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. On the other hand, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), as another glucose-consuming pathway reported to be enhanced by IVI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], contributes to a higher yield of nucleotides and ATP for viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Significant up-regulation of the PPP key enzymes in influenza-infected cells, including glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), was reported by Janke et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. G6PD enzyme is also responsible for the generation of NADPH [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], a critical component of fatty acid biosynthesis. The level of G6PD activity specifies the ability of the cell to clear the accumulated ROS. Cells with an average G6PD level can retain the appropriate GSH/GSSG ratio and keep the ROS production at a tolerably low level, indicating that G6PD activity has an inverse correlation with cellular ROS level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Disruption of redox balance has been shown to contribute to replication and virulence of several viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], and G6PD deficiency can cause this disruption. Despite the results reported by Janke et al., G6PD activity seems to have an inverse relation with some other respiratory viral infections. For example, in an in vitro study, after infection with human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, the production of viral particles in G6PD-deficient or G6PD-knockdown cells was higher than in healthy cells, and this was correlated with increased oxidant production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].
