<p id="Par30">Viruses take advantage of various cellular mechanisms to replicate efficiently. Vital metabolic pathways of host cells are one of the most widely used mechanisms targeted by viruses, resulting in considerable changes. In this context, studies have revealed that various human viruses, such as cytomegalovirus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and reovirus [
