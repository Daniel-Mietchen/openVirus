<p id="Par51">The PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway has been shown to play a pivotal role in a variety of cellular pathways, including proliferation and nutrient uptake, and its activation increases the glucose uptake through the up-regulation of cell surface glucose transporter [

BEZ235 alters glucose metabolism via blockage of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, and some clinical trials are underway to assess this strategy in cancer therapy (Smith et al., 2012). On the other hand, several lines of evidence have demonstrated that siRNA targets the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, thereby warding off influenza infection [

In a new study by Smallwood et al., it was found that although BEZ235 did not interfere with the early stages of the infection, it could finally reduce the viral progeny and result in prolonged survival in mice challenged by the influenza virus. Indeed, BEZ235 induced hemostasis in the PI3K/mTOR pathway via phosphorylation of p85 and 4E-BP1 and through reconstitution of metabolic status, which was already altered by the virus [
