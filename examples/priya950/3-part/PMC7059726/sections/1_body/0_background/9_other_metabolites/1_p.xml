<p id="Par37">The aforementioned metabolic processes are not the only pathways affected by influenza virus infection. This virus has the ability to induce higher consumption rates of glutamine during glutaminolysis, which can be attributed to transient c-Myc overexpression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Myc acts to regulate glutamine uptake and its utilization in the cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that catalytic activity of glutaminase, as the key enzyme in glutaminolysis, greatly increases following the infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Moreover, essential amino acids, especially tryptophan, are other materials whose quantities have been shown to decline in infected tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. mTORC1 can up-regulate protein synthesis through several downstream factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Thus, induction of mTORC1 signaling by the influenza virus leads to higher usage of essential amino acid storages for concurrent production of large amounts of viral and cellular proteins. Infection of influenza virus can also alter the cellular level and metabolism of purines and pyrimidines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], and is associated with both increased activities of nucleotide catabolism core enzymes including adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XO) and elevated levels of inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Enhanced catabolic degradation of nucleotides and their metabolites can facilitate the production of superoxide and contribute to the pathogenesis of influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].
