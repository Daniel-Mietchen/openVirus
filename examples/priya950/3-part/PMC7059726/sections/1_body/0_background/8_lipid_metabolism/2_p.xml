<p id="Par35">The pulmonary surfactant system, which is involved in suppressing influenza infection in the respiratory tracts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], can be disrupted due to significant influenza-induced changes in the abundance of different types of PC and PE species as the major components of surfactants [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Tanner et al. proposed a principal correlation between influenza replication and choline lipids metabolism. They found an IVI-mediated reduction in ester-linked PC species as well as an increased level of sphingomyelin (SM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>], probably connected with expending cellular choline stores for SM synthesis. This led to an increase in SM species within the infected cell. SM and short-chain fatty acid-containing ether-linked PC (ePC) species were found in higher amounts in both infected cells and virions and therefore appeared to be involved in viral morphogenesis. On the other hand, long-chain fatty acid-containing ePC was increased in infected cells while having low levels in the structure of the virion, highlighting the role of this phospholipid in replication of the virus [
