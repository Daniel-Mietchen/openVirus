 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is also reported that influenza infection significantly increases ROS production by inducing Nox4, and the proliferation of this virus in lung epithelial cells is dependent on redox-sensitive pathways activated by Nox4-derived ROS [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is indicated that higher levels of GSH, antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in the lungs of female mice result in superior resistance of these mice to influenza infection. In contrast, male mice are more susceptible to this infection due to higher expression of Nox4. This difference is due primarily to the higher ability of female mice to maintain cellular redox homeostasis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Amatore et al. also showed that an increase in GSH content in organs by affecting GSH-dependent antiviral pathways strengthens the immune system, in particular Th1 cell response, and decreases viral replication [
