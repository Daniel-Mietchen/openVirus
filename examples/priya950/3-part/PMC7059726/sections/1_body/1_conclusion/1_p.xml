<p id="Par56">Based on recent studies, influenza virus infection can interfere with cellular metabolic pathways either directly or indirectly via stimulation of immune system mediators. Through enhancing the activity of the mTORC1 complex, the influenza virus strengthens several metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, glutaminolysis, pentose phosphate, and fatty acid synthesis, to provide more ATP and structural materials for viral replication. On the other hand, Î²-oxidation suppression following viral infection can help to supply essential fatty acids for the synthesis of structural lipids. However, exhausting cellular ATP resources due to virus replication, as well as an increase in pro-inflammatory lipid synthesis, will ultimately lead to irreversible cell damage. Innate immune responses following influenza infection play a crucial role in metabolic alterations. IFN is one of these mediators that acts on several metabolites such as IDO and NO and thereby affects lipid and amino acid pathways. Since the drug resistance in influenza infection is a global concern, research on designing novel therapeutic modalities to tackle pandemics is of particular importance. Thus, a clear understanding of the metabolic alterations during influenza infection would be tremendously helpful for therapeutic purposes.</p>
