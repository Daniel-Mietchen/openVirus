  <p>Role of IFNs in host cell metabolic changes following infection with influenza. IFNs affect the lipid metabolism through downregulation of SREBP-2, leading to higher cholesterol biosynthesis, and suppressed host cell apoptosis and PGE-2 production. They can also enhance the level of 25-HC arisen from cholesterol (via activation of Chol-25 hydroxylase) and IDO. SAT-1 can be upregulated by IFNs, lowering the levels of spermidine and spermine and thereby dampening influenza replication</p>
