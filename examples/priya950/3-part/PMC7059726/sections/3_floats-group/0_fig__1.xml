  <p>Metabolic changes caused by influenza infection and related mechanisms. Several anabolic and catabolic processes can be affected: higher glucose uptake and metabolism in glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways, higher nucleotide catabolism, increase in biosynthesis of fatty acids including arachidonic acid, the precursor of proinflammatory lipids, and also enhanced glutaminolysis and protein synthesis. Activation of mTORC1&amp;2 signaling and downstream factors by influenza infection may have an essential role in the upregulation of these metabolic processes. In addition, high ATP consumption and reduced Î²-oxidation, as well as glucose oxidation by influenza infection, contribute to the ATP crisis and hence influenza-related multi-organ failure</p>
