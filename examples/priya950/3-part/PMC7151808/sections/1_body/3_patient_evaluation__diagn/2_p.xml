<p id="p0050">The diagnosis and diagnostic methods used to identify the viral pathogens are also dependent on the clinical illness day. 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 36.1</xref> demonstrates the time-dependent diagnostic test that can be performed during the clinical course of the patient. In this example, viremia will start before fever and last until 6 days of clinical illness and before the onset of viral-specific IgM and IgG antibodies. During viremia, diagnostic tests should be focused on detecting the virus, whether by viral isolation, molecular techniques, or antigen detection. Viremia starts to resolve with the onset of the host response and corresponding rise in viral-specific IgM and IgG. Antibodies will continue to rise during the convalescent period, and IgG will last several years or more. Once antibodies start to rise, the diagnostics are focused on their detection, with a variety of methods that can be used, including enzyme-linked immunoassays, hemagglutination inhibition, plaque reduction neutralization, and rapid tests.
