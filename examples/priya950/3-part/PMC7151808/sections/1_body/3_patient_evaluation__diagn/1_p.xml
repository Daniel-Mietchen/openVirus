<p id="p0045">Understanding the incubation time of viral pathogens is the first important step in evaluating the febrile patient. A travel history in an area of an outbreak or potential hot spot for an emerging disease should be within the incubation period of these pathogens (1–21 days). For example, a febrile patient in your clinic or emergency room who had traveled overseas 3 months before fever would be unlikely to have a viral infection, and potential other etiologies such as non-falciparum malaria or a parasitic infection should be considered. An extensive travel history and exposures while traveling will help to determine the risk for the patient to acquire a local infection. An important question often not asked is “who else is sick in your travel party, and have you been in contact with anyone acutely ill?” This can often be an important clue on the risk of acquiring an infection. If the patient is within the incubation period and at risk for a viral illness, determining the clinical illness day is important when obtaining the history. Our studies in hospitalized patients with dengue infection, for example, illustrate the importance for the clinician to approach the viral febrile illness and differential of potential viruses by determining the patient's clinical illness day and their clinical manifestation.

 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 36.1</xref> demonstrates an idealized patient with a viral febrile illness. In this example, after an incubation period of 3 days, the first day of viremia occurs. Viremia will continue, with the onset of fever heralding the first day of clinical illness. In general, the first 3 to 5 days of clinical illness of most viral infections will be a generalized febrile illness with no clinical signs or symptoms that will distinguish the illness to a specific viral pathogen, denoted here as a 
 <italic>viral syndrome.</italic> Headache, myalgia, nausea, diarrhea, and respiratory symptoms will be common during the viral syndrome stage. Influenza, dengue, chikungunya, Ebola, or Lassa fever will all be indistinguishable from each other in the early clinical illness. By day 5 of the clinical illness day, day 9 post-infection, the manifestations will become more specific and hemorrhagic manifestations and coagulopathy will occur, along with plasma leakage and encephalitis. As the host response increases with antibody levels rising and cytokines peaking, the manifestations of a specific viral illness will become apparent as cellular damage occurs.
