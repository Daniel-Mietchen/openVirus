<p id="p0605">The main differential diagnoses for Zika virus infection are other viruses transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, especially dengue (also a flavivirus) and chikungunya (an alphavirus). Because Zika, dengue, and chikungunya cause similar symptoms and each may have important consequences, distinguishing between the three arboviruses by molecular test or serology followed by PRNT is desirable. Other diagnoses that may resemble Zika virus infections include rubeola, rubella, parvovirus, West Nile virus, and many other viruses, as well as leptospirosis, rickettsiosis, and malaria.
