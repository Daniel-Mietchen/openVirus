<p id="p0595">Detection of Zika IgM by IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) followed by confirmation with plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) can also establish the diagnosis. Zika IgM may be reactive when performed 2 to 12 weeks after exposure, but can persist longer. Unfortunately, Zika serology cross-reacts with other flaviviruses, and PRNT, which is needed to differentiate among the flaviviruses, is labor intensive, time consuming, and challenging to interpret. Unlike dengue and chikungunya, where IgG is available to assess past infection and immunity, Zika IgG is not available in the United States.</p>
