 </xref> Virus is found in vaginal secretions, and viral RNA has been documented in semen up to 188 days after infection and infectious virus up to 69 days. In a longitudinal assessment of Zika virus RNA in body fluids, 95% of men had cleared the virus from semen after about 3 months.

 </xref> In areas infested with competent vectors, it is difficult to assess what percentage is vector borne and how much infection is sexually transmitted. Zika virus particles and RNA have been found in breast milk, but transmission via breastfeeding has not been documented to date. Virus persists longer in whole blood than in plasma, which may be relevant for diagnosis and in testing blood or tissue donations for transfusion/transplantation. Transmission via platelet transfusion was reported from Brazil,
