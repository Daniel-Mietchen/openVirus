<p id="p1360">Sindbis virus (SINV) is an alphavirus within the Western equine encephalitis virus complex. The virus is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Culex,</italic> typically among multiple avian species, but occasional human infections and human outbreaks do occur. The virus is widely distributed, with reports of virus circulation in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. Most infections in humans are asymptomatic, but infection may result in symptoms of fever, arthralgia, and rash along with fatigue, myalgias, and headache in some cases. Diagnosis is typically made with confirmation of seroconversion. There are no specific therapies for symptomatic cases, but treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be helpful.
