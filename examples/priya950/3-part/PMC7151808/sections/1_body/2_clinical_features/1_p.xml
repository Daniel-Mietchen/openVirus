<p id="p0040">Emerging viral pathogens can, in general, present in one of the following clinical categories: (1) generalized febrile illness producing a “viral syndrome,” (2) fever with meningitis/encephalitis, (3) fever with joint pain, (4) hemorrhagic fever, and (5) birth defects. Due to human host and viral diversity, many viruses can produce illness across the spectrum of these clinical categories. For example, dengue virus as a first infection can result in a sub-clinical infection or a febrile illness that results in a self-limited fever, myalgia, bone pain, and transient laboratory abnormalities. On second infection, dengue virus in a minority of patients can produce a severe hemorrhagic disease. Chikungunya and Ross River viruses can produce a generalized febrile illness but also severe joint pains that can persist for months. Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, and the equine encephalitis viruses are classic viruses that produce a meningo-encephalitis in 1% of the persons infected. Yellow fever and the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) are examples of severe hemorrhagic fever viruses. The recent Zika virus outbreak and birth defects associated with infection in pregnant women have broadened our clinical categories to include those that produce birth defects. All viruses produce a constellation of signs and symptoms early in infection that are clinically the same. After infection, an incubation period of normally between 1 and 14 days can occur, with some exceptions. For example, Ebola has been reported to occur 21 days after exposure.

 </xref> The first onset of symptoms heralds the host immune response with fever followed by generalized symptoms of headache, muscle aches, joint pains, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Early laboratory abnormalities that would indicate a viral infection include leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Electrolyte and renal function abnormalities can be common if the patient is volume depleted. As the disease progresses, clinical manifestations will be become more specific for the clinical syndrome and provide clues on the potential virus, such as the onset of headache, neck stiffness, and altered sensorium in the case of encephalitis; severe joint pains; or bleeding internally or externally with blood loss or hemoconcentration, with plasma leakage with the hemorrhagic fevers. Specific manifestations such as diuresis, volume loss, and renal dysfunction can be an indicator for viruses that produce hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome such as the Hantaviruses or Lassa fever. Rash is common to all the viral illnesses and in general indicates a shift in the host immune response from a cell-mediated to a humoral immune response with a rise in antibodies. It is important for the clinician to understand that viremia occurs several days before the onset of clinical illness and through the duration of early clinical symptoms. Pathogens that are spread by insect vectors, the respiratory route, blood-borne contact, or sexually can occur before the onset of clinical symptoms, and thus infect others who come in contact by that route. Contact tracing from the index patient should include the days of viremia before the onset of symptoms.
