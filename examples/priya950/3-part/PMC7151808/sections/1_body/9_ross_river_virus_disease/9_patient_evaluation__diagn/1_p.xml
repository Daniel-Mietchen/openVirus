<p id="p0885">A detailed history is helpful, especially with regard to residence, domestic and international travel, and season. Rapid onset of arthritic symptoms is usual, with pain on movement, tenderness, and slight swelling (which can be hard to detect) the most common signs. Tenderness, swelling, heat, redness, and intolerance to movement or pressure can be extreme. The rash is usually maculopapular, occurs within a few days after the onset of symptoms, and resolves within 5 to 10 days.

 </xref> Rash distribution varies considerably, with the trunk and limbs most affected. The face is less affected and, rarely, the rash may be confined to palms, soles, and/or digital webs. Lymphadenopathy is frequently present, if sought. Aside from fatigue, constitutional symptoms usually resolve within a week.
