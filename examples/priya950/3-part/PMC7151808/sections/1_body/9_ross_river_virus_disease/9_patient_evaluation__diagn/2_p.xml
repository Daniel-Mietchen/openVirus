<p id="p0890">Diagnosis is usually made by a primary-care physician aided by a commercial serodiagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based test (widely available in Australia). Two serologic tests at least 10 to 14 days apart are recommended. Peripheral blood counts are usually normal except for a possible slight neutrophilia. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate can occur, but decreases within a few weeks. Serum C-reactive protein levels are rarely elevated. If erosive changes are seen in x-rays, alternative diagnoses should be sought.
