<p id="p1170">Leukopenia is a common finding in unspecific laboratory tests within the first week of illness, and a white cell count of about 2500/mm
 <sup>3</sup> is commonly observed; platelet counts and liver function tests are usually normal. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of fever, arthralgia, and rash, particularly dengue, Oropouche, chikungunya, and Zika fever viruses. The laboratory diagnosis of Mayaro fever either depends on virus isolation attempts or serologic diagnostic and molecular methods for genome detection. For virus isolation, biologic samples (serum or blood) obtained from viremic patients (up to 5 days after the onset of the symptoms) are used for inoculation in newborn mice or in Vero cells. Suspensions prepared from brains of mice or supernatants of infected cells are used as antigens in either complement fixation tests or an immunofluorescence assay against hyperimmune sera of different arboviruses circulating in the region. Specific identification of Mayaro virus is carried out using neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests
