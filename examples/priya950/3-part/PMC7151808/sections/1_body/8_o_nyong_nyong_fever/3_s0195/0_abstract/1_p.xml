<p id="p0620">O'nyong nyong fever (ONN) is an arboviral disease caused by an alphavirus of the Semliki Forest complex. Clinical disease has primarily been described in large sporadic outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa focused primarily in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. ONN is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> and has no known vertebrate reservoir. Clinical disease is characterized by fever and arthralgia. Conjunctival suffusions and cervical lymphadenopathy have also been described in about half of the cases. Diagnosis can be made with amplification of virus using molecular amplification during viremia or by demonstration of seroconversion. Treatment is supportive, with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) providing some potential benefit.
