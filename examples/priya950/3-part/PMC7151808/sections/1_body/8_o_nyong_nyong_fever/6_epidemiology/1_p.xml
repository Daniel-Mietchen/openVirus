<p id="p0715">ONN has largely been described as occurring in epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. After the end of the initial epidemic in 1962, no clinical cases were recognized until a subsequent epidemic occurred in Uganda in 1996 to 1997 resulting in several hundred cases. However, sporadic cases have been reported from several regions in sub-Saharan Africa outside of recognized epidemics.

 </xref> An illness with clinical features very similar to ONN has been described in Nigeria with the causative agent originally named 
 <italic>Igbo Ora virus.</italic> Subsequent studies have shown that Igbo Ora is actually a strain of ONNV.

 </xref> The genetic similarities of Igbo Ora and the 1996 to 1997 ONNV to the 1959 ONNV, together with serosurveys from Kenya, Cameroon, and West Africa, suggest at least some level of unrecognized endemic transmission occurs during interepidemic periods.
