<p id="p0725">The virus is principally transmitted by 
 <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. gambiae,</italic> both of which also serve as important vectors of malaria. No vertebrate reservoir has been identified. Risk factors for infection are likely to be related to risk of mosquito exposure and are likely to be similar to risk factors associated with malaria.
