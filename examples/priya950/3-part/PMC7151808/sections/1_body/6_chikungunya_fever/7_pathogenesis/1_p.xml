<p id="p0405">After the bite of an infected mosquito, the virus replicates in fibroblasts and epithelial cells leading to a viremia that can reach up to 8 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL. The skin, joints, and muscles are the primary affected organs, whereas the nervous system, heart, and liver are less frequently involved. Macrophage appear to be susceptible to infection during the viremic phase. Mouse models have shown that type 1 interferon response appears to be associated with control of infection.
