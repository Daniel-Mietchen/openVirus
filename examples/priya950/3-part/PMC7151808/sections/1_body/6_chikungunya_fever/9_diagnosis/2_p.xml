<p id="p0425">The clinical laboratory findings in CHIK are not remarkable. A few patients may present with leukopenia with relative lymphocytosis; however, most patients will have normal blood counts. The platelet count may be moderately depressed. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels are typically elevated in acute cases.
