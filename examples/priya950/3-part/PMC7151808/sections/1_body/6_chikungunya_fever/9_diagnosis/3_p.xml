<p id="p0430">Virus-specific IgM antibodies typically can be detected by 5 to 7 days of illness using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Because viremia is so high and persists for several days post-illness onset, blood samples for virus isolation and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) should be collected within the first 5 days of illness when viremia is detectable. Frequently, diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by virus isolation or molecular techniques such as RT-PCR, for which a wide range of tests now exist.
