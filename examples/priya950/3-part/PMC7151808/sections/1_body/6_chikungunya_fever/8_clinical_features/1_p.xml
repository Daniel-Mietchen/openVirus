<p id="p0410">CHIK is an acute infection of abrupt onset, heralded by high fever and severe arthralgia, followed by other constitutional symptoms and rash (typically maculopapular) lasting for a period of 1 to 7 days. The incubation period is usually 3 to 7 days, with a range of 2 to 12 days. Fever rises abruptly, often reaching 39°C to 40°C. This acute phase lasts a few days to 2 weeks.
