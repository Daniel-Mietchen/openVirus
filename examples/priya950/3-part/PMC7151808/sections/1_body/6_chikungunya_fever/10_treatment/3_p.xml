<p id="p0445">Both primary vectors, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus,</italic> are principally daytime biters. Insect repellant containing 
 <italic>N,N</italic>-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) or another registered active ingredient should be applied on exposed skin (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 36.2.1</xref> ). People should be advised to wear long sleeves and pants and have secure screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out. Insecticide-treated bed net use during daytime resting can help prevent mosquito bites. Infected persons should be protected from further mosquito exposure (staying indoors and/or under a mosquito net during the first few days of illness) so that they cannot contribute to the transmission cycle.
