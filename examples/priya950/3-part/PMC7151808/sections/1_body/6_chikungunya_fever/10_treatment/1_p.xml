<p id="p0435">There is no specific treatment for CHIK. The illness is usually self-limiting and resolves with time. Supportive care with rest is indicated during the acute joint symptoms. Movement and mild exercise may decrease stiffness and arthralgia, but heavy exercise may exacerbate rheumatic symptoms. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for chronic pain. A number of therapeutic options are in development, as are several vaccine candidates.
