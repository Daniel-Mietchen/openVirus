<p id="p1180">Phleboviruses cause human diseases, including severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), Heartland virus disease, and sandfly fever. SFTS virus is transmitted by 
 <italic>Haemaphysalis longicornis</italic> ticks, causing hundreds of cases in China, Japan, and Korea annually. SFTS can lead to multi-organ failure and death. Heartland virus is thought to be transmitted by the Lone Star tick, and has been identified in a handful of cases in the United States. Sandfly fever viruses are transmitted by 
 <italic>Phlebotomus</italic> sandflies in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and South Asia. Sandfly fever is usually a self-limited febrile illness; however, Toscana virus causes central nervous system disease.
