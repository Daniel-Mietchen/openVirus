  <bold>Epidemiology:</bold>
 </italic> Sandfly fever is caused by viruses within the sandfly fever Naples virus (SFNV) species, including sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV), sandfly fever Turkey virus (SFTV), and Toscana virus.

 <xref rid="bib8.33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Toscana virus is unique among sandfly-transmitted phleboviruses in that it primarily causes CNS disease.
 <xref rid="bib8.34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib8.35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The sandfly fever viruses are found in subtropical regions of southern Europe, North Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India, and can affect the local population as well as travelers and military personnel deployed to these areas.

 </xref> Sandfly fever viruses are transmitted by sandflies of the 
 <italic>Phlebotomus</italic> genus in a human–vector–human cycle, especially during the warm season (e.g., April to October in the Mediterranean).

 <xref rid="bib8.33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The role of animal reservoirs is unclear at present. Only adult female sandflies bite humans and readily pass through mosquito bed nets. Novel sandfly fever viruses continue to be identified and may be responsible for more human disease than previously thought.
