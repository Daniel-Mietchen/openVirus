  <bold>Clinical features:</bold>
 </italic> SFTS presents as a non-specific febrile illness with sudden onset of fever lasting for 5 to 11 days, headache, fatigue, malaise, muscle and joint pain, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea, accompanied by thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which occur in almost all patients, and abnormal liver function tests. Multi-organ involvement can occur about 5 days after illness onset, lasting for 7 to 14 days, with progressive failure in fatal cases or a self-limited course in survivors. Progressive organ failure can be rapid, first in the liver and heart, then the lungs and kidneys. About one fifth of patients can have central nervous system (CNS) manifestations, including apathy, seizures, muscle tremors, and/or coma. Death can occur in 12% to 30% of cases, with the average time between illness onset and death being 9 days.
