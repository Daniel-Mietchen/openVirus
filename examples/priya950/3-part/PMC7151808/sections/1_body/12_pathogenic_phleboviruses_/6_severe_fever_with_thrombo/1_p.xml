 </xref> Since then, hundreds of SFTS cases have been reported in central and eastern China where the disease is endemic. SFTS was first reported in Japan and South Korea in 2013. Retrospective studies have subsequently documented SFTS cases in Japan in 2005, rural areas of central China in spring 2006, and South Korea in 2010.

 <xref rid="bib8.6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> SFTS occurs mainly during the spring and summer months when tick density is highest in endemic areas and human contact with infected ticks from animals is most likely. High-risk groups include farmers, ranchers, forest workers, and others who live in rural, hilly, wooded areas. Person-to-person transmission through direct contact with blood or bloody secretions has been reported.

 <xref rid="bib8.8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> SFTSV is phylogenetically separated into two clades, Chinese and Japanese, with viruses usually (though not always) consistent with their geographic origin. Korean strains fall within the Japanese clade.
