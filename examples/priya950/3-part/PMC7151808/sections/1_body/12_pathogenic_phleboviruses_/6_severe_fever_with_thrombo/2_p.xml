  <bold>Pathogenesis:</bold>
 </italic> SFTSV infection generally has four overlapping stages: incubation, febrile illness, multi-organ involvement, and convalescence (all four stages may not occur in milder infections). The incubation period is generally 5 to 14 days, and can be affected by viral dose and route of infection. Viremia peaks during the febrile illness stage at about 7 to 10 days after fever onset, and high viremia may be associated with poor outcomes.

 <xref rid="bib8.11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Very high viremia can occur, accompanied by uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response. During the multi-organ involvement stage, viremia gradually falls in survivors, but remains high in fatal cases. Viral components have been detected in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.
