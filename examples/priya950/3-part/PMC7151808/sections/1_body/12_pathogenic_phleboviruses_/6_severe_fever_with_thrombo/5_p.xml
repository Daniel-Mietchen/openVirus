  <bold>Treatment and prevention:</bold>
 </italic> No specific therapy has been proven to improve outcomes in SFTS. Treatment is supportive, consisting of early diagnosis and management of complications such as bacterial and fungal infections.
 <xref rid="bib8.12" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>12</sup>
 </xref> Ribavirin has been shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against SFTSV.
 <xref rid="bib8.18" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>18</sup>
 </xref> However, clinical benefit has not been demonstrated by ribavirin alone, perhaps due to sub-optimal doses and/or late timing of intervention.
 <xref rid="bib8.19" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>19</sup>
 </xref> Plasma exchange has been proposed to have some benefit when administered early.
 <xref rid="bib8.20" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>20</sup>
 </xref> Ribavirin and plasma exchange in combination has been used in some SFTS patients who have recovered.
 <xref rid="bib8.21" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>21</sup>
 </xref> Plasma exchange followed by convalescent serum therapy has been used to successfully treat a case of SFTS encephalopathy.
 <xref rid="bib8.14" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>14</sup>
 </xref> All of these therapies need to be confirmed with further studies. No vaccine is available for SFTS, and prevention consists of avoidance of tick bites. Health care providers should adhere to strict contact and droplet precautions due to the risk of environmental contamination and person-to-person transmission, especially when treating critically ill patients.
