<p id="p0915">Oropouche fever is the native most prevalent arboviral disease in the Americas and is caused by Oropouche fever virus (OROV) (
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic> genus in the Peribunyaviridae family). OROV has four recognized genotypes (I, II, III, and IV) causing the same disease, which is characterized by acute febrile onset accompanied by headache, photophobia, muscle and joint pains, and in limited cases, meningitis. OROV is widely distributed in northern South America and is transmitted in urban settings by the midge 
 <italic>Culicoides paraensis</italic>. The diagnosis is performed by virus isolation into cell culture or mice of suspected blood of acute-phase patients, by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR, and by serologically through detection of specific IgM antibodies. Conventional serologic tests can also give a positive result, but need two serum samples (acute and convalescent phases) with an interval of at least 1 week. There are no specific drugs for treatment of Oropouche fever patients, but fever, headache, and muscle/joint pains are often treated with common analgesics such as aspirin and acetaminophen. No vaccine against OROV is available, and only personal protection measures can avoid the anthropophilic vector bites.
