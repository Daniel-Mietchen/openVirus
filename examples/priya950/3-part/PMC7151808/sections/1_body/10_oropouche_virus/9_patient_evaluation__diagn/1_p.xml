<p id="p1040">The differential diagnosis includes other causes of febrile illness, particularly dengue fever, chikungunya fever, and malaria. Blood samples collected during the acute phase of illness (up to 5 days after the onset of the symptoms) can be used for virus detection methods. The most commonly applied molecular method is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),

 </xref> Virus isolation can be attempted in newborn mice or hamsters (1â€“3 days), or in Vero or C6/36 cell cultures. For viral identification, suspensions prepared from brains of mice or supernatants of infected Vero or C6/36 cells are used as antigens in complement fixation or immunofluorescence assays with OROV hyper-immune serum. More recently the molecular approaches have been used for genotyping and identification of isolates.
