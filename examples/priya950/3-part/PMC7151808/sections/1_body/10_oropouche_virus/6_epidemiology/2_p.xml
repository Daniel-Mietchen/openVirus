<p id="p1025">Many outbreaks of Oropouche fever have been characterized by epidemics spreading in numerous villages within one geographic area and over a short period; these episodes essentially occur in new colonized areas and in the suburbs of large Amazonian urban centers. The spread of the virus is probably a consequence of the circulation of viremic people in localities where the transmitting vector can be found and where there is a large concentration of susceptible individuals.
