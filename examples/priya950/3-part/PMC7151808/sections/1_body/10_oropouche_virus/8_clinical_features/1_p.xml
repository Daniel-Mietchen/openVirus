<p id="p1035">Clinically, Oropouche fever is characterized by the sudden onset of high fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, anorexia, dizziness, chills, and photophobia. Some patients present with a morbilliform exanthem that resembles rubella or dengue. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctiva congestion, epigastric and retro-ocular pain, and other constitutional symptoms are also common.

 </xref> Some patients may display a picture of aseptic meningitis, and others temporary encephalitis. A recrudescence of mild symptoms several days after waning of the initial febrile episode is commonly seen (biphasic illness). Recovery is complete in all individuals without apparent sequelae, even in the most severe cases. There are no reports of proven lethality caused by Oropouche fever.
