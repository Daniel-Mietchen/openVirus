There is accompanying leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and often mild hepatic transaminase elevation. Petechiae may develop spontaneously, but, most commonly, can be elicited in a positive tourniquet test.

 </xref> Clinically significant bleeding is much less common, but can occasionally be severe or life threatening. Toward the end of the febrile period, the classic rash of dengue may appear (Herman's rash). It is a confluent, erythematous, macular rash over the extremities with scattered, well-circumscribed areas of sparing. The appearance of this rash is pathognomonic for a DENV infection.
