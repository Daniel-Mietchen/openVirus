<p id="p0300">In-hospital management should be arranged for patients with the pre-defined warning signs, early evidence of plasma leakage (including narrow pulse pressure), bleeding or severe hematologic abnormalities, co-morbid conditions, or those with unreliable access to outpatient follow-up care. For hospitalized patients without frank hypotension or shock, the key aspect of supportive therapy is judicious intravascular volume replacement as the critical phase is entered. This is accomplished by the careful administration of intravenous isotonic crystalloid solutions (e.g., 0.9% saline, Ringer's lactate, Hartmann's solution) with frequent re-assessment of intravascular volume status and urine output. The overly aggressive use of intravenous fluids or the failure to adequately monitor therapy can lead to serious complications of fluid overload during the critical phase of illness. Treatment guidelines are shown in
