<p id="p0140">Dengue is the most prevalent and widespread human arboviral disease in the 21st century. It is caused by infection with any one of four dengue viruses (DENVs 1â€“4), single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus,</italic> family Flaviviridae. The DENVs are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected urban and peri-urban mosquitoes (female 
 <italic>Aedes [Stegomyia] aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes [Stegomyia] albopictus</italic>). Outbreaks of dengue-like illnesses were recognized and recorded in the 17th and 18th centuries, and perhaps even earlier.
