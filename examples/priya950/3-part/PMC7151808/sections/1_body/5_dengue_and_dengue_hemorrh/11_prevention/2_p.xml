<p id="p0315">Dengue vaccine development has moved forward with encouraging advances. Given the potential for increased disease severity upon sequential infection with heterologous DENV serotypes, a general consensus has been that effective vaccination strategies will require simultaneous immunization to the four DENV serotypes (tetravalent vaccines). A chimeric live-attenuated viral vaccine, where the DENVs 1 to 4 envelope proteins have been engineered onto a yellow fever (YF)–17D vaccine backbone, is licensed in several countries. However, if this vaccine is administered to truly dengue-naïve individuals, it appears to be able to enhance the subsequent disease severity with a natural DENV infection. Another tetravalent live-attenuated dengue vaccine (attenuated by a deletion in the DENV2 3’ untranslated region [UTR]) is in phase III clinical trials. Other dengue vaccine products that are in pre-clinical or early clinical phases include an adjuvanted recombinant envelope protein vaccine, an adjuvanted inactivated virus vaccine, and a plasmid DNA vaccine. The combination of effective dengue vaccination with vector-control strategies will open up the possibility of severely halting, or even eradicating, DENV transmission in many endemic regions.</p>
