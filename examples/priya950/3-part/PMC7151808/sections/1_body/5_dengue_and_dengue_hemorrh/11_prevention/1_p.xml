<p id="p0310">Dengue prevention can be approached by strategies to minimize humanâ€“vector contact and control mosquito-vector populations. Functioning screens and insecticide-treated bed nets for daytime sleeping (e.g., in infants) can reduce mosquito-vector contact indoors. Personal measures that afford some protection against the daytime biting habits of female 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> include wearing clothing that minimizes skin exposure and appropriate use of repellants on exposed skin or clothing. Effective repellants should contain N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), 3-(N-acetyl-N-butyl)-aminopropionic acid ethyl ester (IR3535), or 1-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpropylester (icaridin).

 </xref> At the public health level, a sustained and integrated vector-control strategy is generally needed to consistently reduce 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> population densities. 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes proliferate in many peri-domestic water-containing habitats. These include purposely filled man-made containers (e.g., water storage barrels, flowerpots/vases), rain-filled objects (e.g., used tires), and natural habitats (e.g., tree holes).
