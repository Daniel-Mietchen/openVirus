<p id="p0160">Numerous risk factors have been identified for the development of severe dengue. They can be divided into three general steps, and multiple risk factor combinations can take place to produce the three steps. The first step includes factors that can increase the dengue viral load. These include antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection,

 </xref> and host genetics. The final step includes factors that tip the balance in favor of permeability-inducing conditions in the serosal cavities. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines/mediators can promote endothelial paracellular permeability, and virus-induced type I interferon signaling can augment the endothelial barrier function. Each of the three steps described here is necessary, but not sufficient by itself, to produce severe dengue.
