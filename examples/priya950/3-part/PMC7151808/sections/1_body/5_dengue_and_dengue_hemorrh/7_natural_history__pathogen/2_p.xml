<p id="p0155">The most severe and sometimes fatal form of dengue is dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (severe dengue). The distinguishing characteristic of DHF/DSS is a transient and rapid increase in vascular permeability. The plasma leakage syndrome is most often characterized by hemoconcentration and transudate accumulation across serosal surfaces (i.e., pleural effusions and ascites). In its extreme form (DSS), hypovolemic shock ensues.

 <xref rid="bib1.9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The plasma leakage syndrome of DHF/DSS develops rapidly at the time of defervescence and clearance of viremia, and is transient (hours to days). Primary infection with a DENV serotype produces long-term protective immunity against re-infection with the homologous serotype (homotypic immunity), but only short-term protective immunity against heterologous serotypes (heterotypic immunity).

 <xref rid="bib1.11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The relative risk of developing DHF/DSS (severe dengue) is increased 15- to 100-fold with sequential heterologous DENV infections (secondary DENV infection) compared with primary DENV infections.

 </xref> Most individuals with secondary DENV infections do not develop severe dengue. Primary DENV infections in infants &lt;12 months old also appear more likely to lead to DHF/DSS (severe dengue) than primary DENV infections in children or adults.
