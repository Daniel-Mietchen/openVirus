<p id="p0150">The human dengue cycle is maintained by DENV transmission back and forth between mosquito vectors and viremic individuals. After the bite of a DENV-infected mosquito, there is local viral replication in Langerhans cells and cutaneous dendritic cells and spread to regional lymph nodes. Thereafter, the virus rapidly disseminates, leading to viremia. The likely DENV factories are tissue macrophages, dendritic cells, and adipocytes. The incubation period between a mosquito bite and symptom onset is 3 to 10 days. Viremia generally lasts for 4 to 5 days, and the disappearance of viremia correlates with fever resolution.
