<p id="p0290">Laboratory diagnosis remains the most reliable way to identify a DENV infection. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can detect viral RNA in the blood for up to 5 to 7 days after the onset of fever in primary infections and 3 to 4 days in secondary infections. However, DENV RT-PCR is not routinely available in most clinical settings. Viremia can also be detected by antigen-detection assays that measure circulating levels of a DENV non-structural protein, NS1. The timeline for detectable circulating soluble NS1 lags viral RNA RT-PCR detection by 1 to 2 days. The most widely used serologic assay for dengue is IgM/IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A single positive dengue IgM or high-titer IgG can only provide a presumptive diagnosis of dengue. Definitive serologic diagnosis requires paired acute and convalescent sera. Anti-DENV IgM antibody levels do not generally become positive until the fifth or sixth day of illness and can be affected by other flavivirus infections (e.g., Japanese encephalitis virus, Zika virus). Therefore the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of anti-DENV IgM ELISA assays often depend on the timing of the blood sample, co-circulating flaviviruses in the region, and the manufacturer.</p>
