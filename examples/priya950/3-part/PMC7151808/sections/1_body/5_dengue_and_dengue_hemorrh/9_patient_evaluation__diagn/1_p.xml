<p id="p0280">Dengue should be considered in all individuals in endemic regions, particularly children, who present with an abrupt-onset febrile illness of &lt;10 to 14 daysâ€™ duration during the DENV transmission season. The initial clinical findings in DENV infections are fairly non-specific and can be difficult to distinguish from other common febrile illnesses in the tropics. The differential diagnosis for dengue-like illnesses includes typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infections, or malaria. In the appropriate clinical setting, measles, influenza, chikungunya, or Zika virus infections are also possibilities. Early in the febrile course, the suspicion for a DENV infection can be heightened by the presence of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, mild aspartate aminotransferase elevation, and a positive tourniquet test or spontaneous petechiae. The positive predictive value for combinations of these early clinical findings has generally been good when dengue is highly prevalent (i.e., during the rainy season).
