<p id="par0105">In conclusion, we emphasize the increasing geographic range and expanding epidemiological patterns of Nipah virus in Asia and the potential for urban outbreaks to occur in the near future. Similar to the situation with Ebola in West Africa, there are no licensed vaccines, antiviral drugs, or immune-based antibody therapies for Nipah virus, although early-stage investigational candidates exist for all three types of countermeasure. Unlike before the pan-epidemics of Ebola in West Africa 2014–2016, anticipating urban Nipah virus epidemics and also taking the comprehensive actions needed to prepare for and mitigate such epidemics is still possible in 2018 to avoid disasters like the “preventable tragedy of Ebola” in West Africa (
