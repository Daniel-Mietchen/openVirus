<p id="par0035">A ‘Nipah belt’ has been described across the western part of Bangladesh (
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Hahn et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, human cases have not been reported from outbreaks in the capital city of Dhaka or other major urban areas. Importantly, however, Epstein and colleagues recently reported that Nipah virus RNA in bats exists throughout much of Bangladesh, even beyond the Nipah belt. They noted: “NiV detection was not restricted to the Nipah belt, suggesting spillover is possible anywhere in Bangladesh if a suitable strain and bat–human interface were present” (
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Epstein et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, it is anticipated that the risk of undetected outbreaks of Nipah in Bangladesh and elsewhere in Asia, due either to infected travelers or transmission from bats to humans with associated person-to-person transmission, should be actively anticipated and actions taken in recognition of this threat.
