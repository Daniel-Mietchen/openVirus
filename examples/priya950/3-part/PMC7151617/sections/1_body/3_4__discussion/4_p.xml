<p>With regards to pancreatitis, it was once thought to be mostly associated with fulminant hepatitis, but of late, this dictum has been proven to be wrong as more and more pancreatitis has been reported in patients without fulminant hepatitis [
 <xref rid="B81-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Like other extrahepatic manifestations, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown, and there are a few hypotheses. Some of these include biliary sludging in the early phase of viral illness, the development of edema of the hepatopancreatic ampulla (ampulla of Vater) and a resultant obstruction to the pancreatic fluid outflow, direct inflammation and destruction of pancreatic acinar cell by the virus, release of lysosomal enzymes from the inflamed liver along with the activation of trypsinogen to trypsin and rarely, intrapancreatic hemorrhage due to hypoprothrombinemia or disseminated intravascular coagulation resulting in pancreatic damage and subsequent pancreatitis [

 <xref rid="B81-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. We have also reported a large number of other manifestations, which are much rarer and thus would require more case studies/reports and further research to prove their association with HEV.
