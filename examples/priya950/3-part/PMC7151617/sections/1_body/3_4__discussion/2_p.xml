<p>Various extra-hepatic manifestations of HEV have been reported from time to time, and the neurological manifestations clearly take the lead. The acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common variant of HEV associated GBS (Guillain-Barre syndrome) [
 <xref rid="B76-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Whereas, in a vast majority of patients with neuralgic amyotrophy, the brachial plexus or the phrenic nerve was most commonly affected. These patients are thought to be genetically predisposed for an autoimmune response [
 <xref rid="B77-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] Though the pathophysiology behind these manifestations is largely unclear, three hypotheses have been put forth [
 <xref rid="B75-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], the first hypothesis being the presence of HEV quasi-species with the ability to infect neurologic tissues [
 <xref rid="B75-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. This is supported by the fact that HEV RNA had been isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients, and it was found to be different from that of the ones seen in the serum at the same time point, suggesting the presence of certain neurotropic variants [
 <xref rid="B52-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, this has not always been the case wherein HEV RNA has not been isolated from the CSF [
 <xref rid="B38-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The second hypothesis being the ability of the virus to acquire host RNA sequences, thereby the property to infect multiple cell types including the CNS [
 <xref rid="B77-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The third one being the property of some strains to produce certain antigens which in turn leads to autoimmune inflammatory polyneuropathy via molecular mimicry [
 <xref rid="B76-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In patients with neurological disorders especially peripheral nerve involvement and concurrent liver enzyme elevation it is recommended that clinicians consider the possibility of HEV infection.
