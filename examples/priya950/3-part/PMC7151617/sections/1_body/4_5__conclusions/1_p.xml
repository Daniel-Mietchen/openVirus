<p>In this systematic review, we have made an attempt to summarize the plethora of extra-hepatic manifestations of HEV that have been reported as either case reports, case series, retrospective/prospective observational studies. These manifestations could affect any of the systems in our human body. We report that neurological manifestations (GBS or neuralgic amyotrophy) are the most common extrahepatic manifestations followed by cryoglobulinemia and other inconsequential hematological changes. Acute pancreatitis like in any other viral hepatitis is seen associated with HEV also. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological manifestations of these extra-hepatic manifestations and to prove causal association with HEV.</p>
