<p>Two independent investigators (JPR and AJK) searched PubMed, PubMed Central and Embase databases on 20th October 2018. The search string used in these databases were “(((hepatitis E) AND (Extrahepatic OR Extra-Hepatic))) OR ((Hepatitis E) AND (Neurology OR Cardiology OR Respiratory OR Lung OR Gastrointestinal OR musculoskeletal OR immunology OR pulmonary)) Filters: Abstract availability, English language, and Human studies”. Discrepancies between the two authors were adjudicated by another author (PRR). Review articles, letters to editors where abstract was not available and articles in whom the full text was not available were excluded. Finally, the extra-hepatic manifestations reported in each of the selected articles were classified and reported as neurological, cardiovascular, and hematological and miscellaneous manifestations.</p>
