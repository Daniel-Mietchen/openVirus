<p>HEV infection can be asymptomatic, or it can cause icteric or fulminant hepatitis [
 <xref rid="B5-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The seroprevalence of HEV was estimated at 6% in the USA, 11% in the UK, and 52% in the hyperendemic Toulouse region of south-west France in 2015 [

 <xref rid="B7-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Chronic HEV infection has also been reported, commonly associated with genotype 3, resulting in progressive liver failure, liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis [
 <xref rid="B8-medsci-08-00009" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Of late, there have been a number of publications reporting the extra-hepatic manifestations of HEV infection, both acute and chronic, mainly due to the temporal association between the infection and the extra-hepatic manifestations after excluding the other possible etiologies that may mimic the manifestations. These extra-hepatic manifestations may thus distract the physician from diagnosing HEV infection, and this systematic review is aimed at summarizing the available evidence in this regard.
