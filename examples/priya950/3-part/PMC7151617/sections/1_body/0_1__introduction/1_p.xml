<p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA icosahedral virus that belongs to the 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic> within the Hepeviridae family. Transmission of HEV can occur through the fecal-oral route by contaminated food and water, transfusion of blood, and through mother-to-child vertical transmission. Although person-to-person transmission is uncommon, patients are infectious during fecal shedding [

Genotype 1 is the most common cause of acute hepatitis in Asian countries, especially in India. Genotype 2 is seen commonly in Africa and Central America, Genotype 3 is prevalent in western countries, as well as in Asia and North America, while genotype 4 is detected in Asian and European countries [
