However, the mechanism of ZIKV crossing the physiological barrier to the central nervous systems (CNS) remains elusive. The placental barrier and the blood brain barrier (BBB) protect the fetus from pathogens and ensure healthy brain development during pregnancy. In this study, we used human placenta trophoblasts cells (JEG-3) and human brain-derived endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) as <italic>in vitro</italic> models of the physiological barriers. Results showed that ZIKV could infect JEG-3 cells effectively and reduce the amounts of ZO-1 and occludin between adjacent cells by the proteasomal degradation pathway, suggesting that the permeability of the barrier differentially changed in response to ZIKV infection, allowing the virus particle to cross the host barrier. In contrast, ZIKV could infect hCMEC/D3 cells without disrupting the BBB barrier permeability and tight junction protein expression. Although no disruption to the BBB was observed during ZIKV infection, ZIKV particles were released on the basal side of the BBB model and infected underlying cells. In addition, we observed that fluorescence-labeled ZIKV particles could cross the <italic>in vitro</italic> placenta barrier and BBB model by transcytosis and the action of transcytosis could be blocked by either low temperature or pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis. In summary, the ZIKV uses a cell-type specific paracellular pathway to cross the placenta monolayer barrier by disrupting cellular tight junction. In addition, the ZIKV can also cross both the placenta barrier and the BBB by transcytosis. Our study provided new insights into on the mechanism of the cellular barrier penetration of ZIKV particles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Zika virus</kwd><kwd>placental barrier</kwd><kwd>blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>tight junction</kwd><kwd>transcytosis</kwd><kwd>single-virus imaging</kwd><kwd>ZO-1</kwd><kwd>Occludin</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Zika virus (ZIKV), first isolated from the rhesus monkey in 1947 in Uganda (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dick et al., 1952</xref>), is a re-emerging arthropod-borne RNA virus belonging to the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, which also include the dengue virus (DENV), the West Nile virus (WNV), the Japanese encephalitis viruses (JEV) and the yellow fever virus (YFV). Until 2015, most ZIKV infections were deemed as a mild illness with some common symptoms including headache, fever, arthralgia, rash, myalgia, edema, arthritis, vomiting, and non-purulent conjunctivitis (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>). However, based on recent epidemics, ZIKV infection in adult is associated with the Guillain-Barre&#x02019; syndrome and encephalitis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brasil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dos Santos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Soares et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, vertical transmission of ZIKV from mother to fetus is linked to the elevating incidences of the congenital Zika syndrome on fetuses including microcephaly, congenital malformation, and fetal demise (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cordeiro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Coyne and Lazear, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hoen et al., 2018</xref>). For those infants born with a normal head, congenital ZIKV infection may also cause developed postnatal-onset microcephaly, joint disorders, sensorineural hearing loss, and eye abnormalities (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Fitzgerald et al., 2018</xref>). These studies revealed a wide-spectrum of effects that congenital ZIKV infection has on fetuses, strongly suggesting the importance of understanding the mechanisms of vertical transmission.</p><p>To reach the fetus brain from the infected mother, ZIKV needs to pass two major physiological barriers, the placenta and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The placenta, a highly specialized organ formed only during pregnancy, supports the growth and development of the fetus and is precisely regulated and coordinated to ensure the maximal efficiency of the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the maternal and fetal circulatory systems (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gude et al., 2004</xref>). Its principal function is to supply the fetal brain, with oxygen and nutrients (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Burton and Fowden, 2015</xref>). Moreover, the placenta barrier serves as an essential physiological barrier that protects the fetus from certain toxic molecules, maternal diseases, and pathogenic infections, such as viruses (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gude et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Delorme-Axford et al., 2014</xref>). The main functional unit of the placenta is the chorionic villi that is composed of specialized epithelial cells known as trophoblasts derived from the outer trophectoderm layer. Trophoblasts construct the epithelial covering of the placenta and also generate a subpopulation of invasive extravillous trophoblast cells within which fetal blood is separated by the placental membrane from the maternal blood (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gude et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Burton and Fowden, 2015</xref>). To serve as the initial line of defense against any pathogens attempting to breach the placental barrier, trophoblasts constitute a tight polarized epithelial monolayer comprising tight junctions preventing lateral and paracellular diffusion of substrates. However, at the present time, our knowledge regarding virus-host interactions at the maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy is limited.</p><p>While the placenta serves as the first checkpoint to protect the fetus and support its normal growth and development of the fetus, the BBB provides the second checkpoint critical to protect the fetal brain and ensure healthy brain development (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Coyne and Lazear, 2016</xref>). The BBB is a boundary that separates the circulating blood from the brain and the extracellular fluid in the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Daneman and Prat, 2015</xref>). The BBB is made up of endothelial cells of the vasculature forming cell-to-cell tight junctions to limit the passage of circulating molecules, cells, and pathogens to the CNS (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Stamatovic et al., 2008</xref>). Tight junctions containing more than 40 proteins with both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains generate a continuous, circumferential, belt-like structure at the luminal end of the intercellular space, where it serves as a gatekeeper of the paracellular pathway (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Mateo et al., 2015</xref>). Three major transmembrane proteins, claudin, occluding, and junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), interact with cytoplasmic proteins including ZO-1, cingulin, afadin and &#x003b1;-catenin, which anchor strands to the cytoskeleton, resulting in the formation of cellular tight junctions (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hartsock and Nelson, 2008</xref>). Disruption of the BBB enhances permeability of endothelial cell and is a hallmark of CNS infection (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Daniels and Klein, 2015</xref>). However, recent studies reported that no barrier disruption was observed when ZIKV gained access to the CNS (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Papa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alimonti et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the endocytic transport system is required for the ZIKV to cross the BBB barrier. Given the existence of endosomal sorting pathways in different cell types, it is possible for the BBB cells to employ a similar process of endosomal transportation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ayloo and Gu, 2019</xref>). However, there is no investigation on these pathways in BBB endothelial cells, particularly in the condition under viral infection.</p><p>The placental barrier and the BBB protect the fetal brain development during human pregnancy by forming cellular tight junctions to limit pathogen paracellular movement under the normal condition. However, the ZIKV could be detected in the brains of microcephalic infants, suggesting that the ZIKV can penetrate the CNS in fetus (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Calvet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Mlakar et al., 2016</xref>). There are two possible routes for the viruses to cross the physiological barriers. One is to disrupt the barrier integrity. The Rubella virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), the Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the West Nile virus (WNV), the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and herpes viruses are known to breach the placental barriers to reach the CNS (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Roe et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Coyne and Lazear, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Al-Obaidi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Leibrand et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Mittal et al., 2017</xref>). The other is through transcytosis. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been reported to penetrate the placenta barrier by transcytosis in the first trimester (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bhat and Anderson, 2007</xref>). The JEV has also been found to cross the endothelial cells and pericytes in the BBB in endocytic vesicles (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Liou and Hsu, 1998</xref>). These findings indicate that viruses may cross the barrier not only through the paracellular pathway but also through transcytosis. Although the ZIKV is detected in both the amniotic fluid of pregnant women and in microcephalic fetal brain tissues (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Calvet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Mlakar et al., 2016</xref>), and is thus capable of penetrating the CNS from mother to fetus, the mechanism of such remains unknown. In this study, we would like to combine the <italic>in vitro</italic> Transwell barrier assay and a single-virus tracking (SVT) approach to elucidate the mechanism that the ZIKV employs to cross the placental and the BBB barriers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>The choriocarcinoma cell lines (JEG-3, ATCC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HTB-36<sup>TM</sup>) and African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero, ATCC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> CCL-81<sup>TM</sup>) were cultured in a minimum essential medium (MEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone), 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Gibco).

To investigate this hypothesis, the expression of two tight junction proteins, ZO-1 and occludin were examined in JEG-3 as well as hCMEC/D3.

In the current study, the ZIKV crossing the placenta barrier cells was directly visualized by using Atto647N-ZIKV particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). These results provide strong evidence demonstrating the straight passing of viral particles across the placental barrier rather than a release of newly produced viral particles after replication. Moreover, the action of ZIKV transcytosis could be inhibited by treatments with endocytosis inhibitors and colchicine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Taken together, we demonstrated that both the paracellular pathway and the transcytosis pathway are utilized by ZIKV to cross the placenta barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, top panel). Further studies will be needed in order to illustrate how ZIKV particles select a pathway to cross the placenta barrier and whether they require a specific receptor for ZIKV to interact with.</p><p>In addition to the placenta barrier, the BBB is the other important barrier that protect the fetal brain development during pregnancy (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Goasdoue et al., 2017</xref>). A number of neurotropic viruses enter the CNS by using various pathways including direct transport from peripheral nerves, transinfection and transcytosis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mustafa et al., 2019</xref>). In the current study, the ZIKV can cross brain endothelial cells and release of infectious virus particles, without an increase of endothelial monolayer permeability and no significant cytotoxicity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This is in agreement with previous studies showing the ZIKV crosses the BBB monolayer without the BBB barrier disruption (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Papa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alimonti et al., 2018</xref>). However, our studies showed that there were infectious atto647N-labeled virus particles that crossed the monolayer of BBB barrier cells in the presence of the treatment of endocytic inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7C,D</xref>), suggesting that we still cannot exclude the possibility that some viral particles selectively modulate tight junctions and cross the bottom chamber via paracellular diapedesis without overtly disrupting the BBB permeability. Furthermore, although <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment models proposed that the ZIKV crosses the BBB with no severe disruption, barrier breakdown was detected at a later post-infection time (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Papa et al., 2017</xref>). Because ZIKV infection may recruit leukocyte to the brain and induce neuron lesion and death (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jurado et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mustafa et al., 2019</xref>), it is possible that later BBB disruption may be triggered by inflammatory response rather than ZIKV-induced proteasomal degradation.</p><p>Understanding the pathways for ZIKV passing through physiological barriers, the placental barrier and the BBB, furthers our understanding of the pathophysiology of the ZIKV and provides a basis for developing anti-ZIKV drugs in a relevant cell type. Given that the activation of the proteasome degradation pathway to disrupt tight junction protein participates in a paracellular pathway for the maternal-fetal transmission of the ZIKV by disrupting tight junction proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">&#x02013;4</xref>), it may lead to a new anti-ZIKV approach to maintain the integrity of tight junction and inhibit the process of viral extravasation in the placental by blocking degradation of the tight junction protein. In addition, our findings offer evidence that transcytosis may be a common strategy for the ZIKV to cross both the placental barrier and the BBB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">&#x02013;7</xref>). Since transcytosis is a critical pathway to transport macromolecules intracellularly through the vesicular system (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Tuma and Hubbard, 2003</xref>), it may not be a good druggable target to treat ZIKV infection. Therefore, further studies to reveal whether there is a specific interaction of the ZIKV with the transcytosis machine will facilitate the development of new anti-ZIKV agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>C-FC, L-WC, C-CJ, and Y-HP designed the research, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript.
