<p>To assess the ability of the ZIKV crossing the barrier 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, the virus was added to the media in the apical Transwell insert (translucent polyethylene terephthalate [PET], 0.4 μm pore size). The inoculum was left on the cells for 24 h except for the experiment in which the inoculum was removed after 2 h and replaced with complete endothelial medium for additional 24 h. The inserts were placed in on a 24-well companion plate containing Vero cells growing at the bottom of the well. After 24 h post-infection, Vero cells were washed with PBS, and recognized by an anti-ZIKV E protein antibody and ALEXA488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, sequentially. Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). The percentage of ZIKV-infected cells was calculated by (ZIKV E positive cells/total cells) × 100%.
