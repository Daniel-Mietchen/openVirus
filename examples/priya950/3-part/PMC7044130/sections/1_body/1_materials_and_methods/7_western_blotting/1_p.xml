<p>Infected cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM PMSF). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes which were blocked with a blocking buffer (5% skim milk in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with primary antibodies in the blocking buffer. Herein, the rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 (Invitrogen), the rabbit polyclonal anti-Zika virus E protein (GeneTex, GTX133314), the rabbit monoclonal anti-Occludin antibody (Abcam), and the rabbit polyclonal anti- GAPDH were utilized, respectively. After being washed three times with a blocking buffer, the membrane was probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed with an Immobilon chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). Blots were imaged on an Amersham Imager 680.
