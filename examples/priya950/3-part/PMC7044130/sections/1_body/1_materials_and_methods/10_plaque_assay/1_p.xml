<p>Vero E6 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate with a density of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> overnight. After the cells reached 80–90% confluent, they were washed with PBS and were infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of the ZIKV at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 h. Afterward, ZIKV-infected cells were overlaid with a 1:1 mixture of 2% agarose gel and two-fold DMEM medium containing 4% FBS and 1% P/S, and then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. At 4 days post-infection, the cells were fixed by 10% formaldehyde, and the gels were removed. Finally, the cells were stained with 1% crystal violet to visualize plaque formation. The virus titer was quantified by counting the plaque numbers.
