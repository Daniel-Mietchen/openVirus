Cells were exposed to ZIKV with multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02 in a serum free DMEM medium and were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 h. Afterward, infected cells were replaced in a low serum DMEM medium containing 2% FBS, 1% P/S for virus production. At 4th and 7th days post-infection, the culture medium was collected and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1500 ×
