<p>Total RNA was extracted using a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Scientific-Technologies). cDNA was synthetized from total RNA (5 μg) using RevertAidTM reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Real-time PCR amplification was performed using the KAPA SYBRTM FAST qPCR Kits on BiosystemsTM Real-Time PCR Instruments. Specific primers for individual genes used for RT-qPCR are: ZO-1 (Forward: 5′- CACCTTTTGATAATCAGCACTCTCA-3′; Reverse: 5′- CTCTAGGTGCCTGTTCGTAACGT-3′), Occludin (Forward: 5′- TCAGGGAATATCCACCTATCACTTCAG-3′; Reverse: 5′- CATCAGCAGCAGCCATGTACTCTTCAC-3′), ZIKV E protein (Forward: 5′- AAGTACACATACCAAAACAAAGTGGT-3′; Reverse: 5′- TCCGCTCCCCCTTTGGTCTTG-3′), and GAPDH (Forward: 5′- AAGGTCATCCCTGAGCTGAA-3′; Reverse: 5′-TTCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGT-3′). Amplification of cDNA was initiated with 3 min at 95°C, followed by 50 cycles of 3 s at 95°C and 30 s at 60°C.</p>
