<p>Cells were seeded to 24-well PET cell culture inserts, 0.4-μm pore size for 7 days, in a two-chambered system. In this system, barrier cells form a polarized monolayer with tight junctions between cells, allowing access to both apical and basolateral domains. Cells were incubated for 30 min with various transcytosis inhibitors in different concentration, including 10 μM of nystatin (Sigma), 10 μM of chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ, Sigma), 20 μM of dimethyl amiloride (DMA, Sigma), and 10 μM of colchicine (Sigma). Drugs were administered to the cells in both apical and basolateral chambers at identical concentrations. Thereafter, 100 μl of Atto647-ZIKV (2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies ml
 <sup>–1</sup> of virus) was added into the upper chamber. After 4 h incubation with cells, all of the basolateral supernatant was collected. Percent transcytosis was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity of Atto647N through using a fluorescent plate reader.
