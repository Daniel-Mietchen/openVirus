<p>To reach the fetus brain from the infected mother, ZIKV needs to pass two major physiological barriers, the placenta and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The placenta, a highly specialized organ formed only during pregnancy, supports the growth and development of the fetus and is precisely regulated and coordinated to ensure the maximal efficiency of the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the maternal and fetal circulatory systems (

The main functional unit of the placenta is the chorionic villi that is composed of specialized epithelial cells known as trophoblasts derived from the outer trophectoderm layer. Trophoblasts construct the epithelial covering of the placenta and also generate a subpopulation of invasive extravillous trophoblast cells within which fetal blood is separated by the placental membrane from the maternal blood (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Burton and Fowden, 2015</xref>). To serve as the initial line of defense against any pathogens attempting to breach the placental barrier, trophoblasts constitute a tight polarized epithelial monolayer comprising tight junctions preventing lateral and paracellular diffusion of substrates. However, at the present time, our knowledge regarding virus-host interactions at the maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy is limited.
