<p>In this study we investigated the pathways for the ZIKV crossing the endothelial cell monolayer of both the placenta barrier and the BBB. Using fluorescence-tagged dextran as an indicator, our results revealed that ZIKV infection enhanced cellular permeability in JEG-3 cells but not in hCMEC/D3 cells. Moreover, in JEG-3 cells, ZIKV infection reduces the amount of tight junction proteins, ZO-1 and occludin, through the proteasomal degradation pathway, resulting in disruption of tight junction. In contrast, using fluorescence-labeled ZIKV particles and pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis, we demonstrated transcytosis as an additional pathway for the ZIKV crossing the monolayer of JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3. As summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, our current study elucidated that the ZIKV uses a cell-type specific paracellular pathway to cross the placenta monolayer barrier by disrupting cellular tight junction. In addition, the ZIKV can also cross both the placenta barrier and the BBB by transcytosis (
