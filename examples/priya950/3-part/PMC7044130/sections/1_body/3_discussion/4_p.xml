<p>In addition to the placenta barrier, the BBB is the other important barrier that protect the fetal brain development during pregnancy (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Goasdoue et al., 2017</xref>). A number of neurotropic viruses enter the CNS by using various pathways including direct transport from peripheral nerves, transinfection and transcytosis (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mustafa et al., 2019</xref>). In the current study, the ZIKV can cross brain endothelial cells and release of infectious virus particles, without an increase of endothelial monolayer permeability and no significant cytotoxicity

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This is in agreement with previous studies showing the ZIKV crosses the BBB monolayer without the BBB barrier disruption (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Papa et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alimonti et al., 2018</xref>). However, our studies showed that there were infectious atto647N-labeled virus particles that crossed the monolayer of BBB barrier cells in the presence of the treatment of endocytic inhibitors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7C,D</xref>), suggesting that we still cannot exclude the possibility that some viral particles selectively modulate tight junctions and cross the bottom chamber via paracellular diapedesis without overtly disrupting the BBB permeability. Furthermore, although 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment models proposed that the ZIKV crosses the BBB with no severe disruption, barrier breakdown was detected at a later post-infection time (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Papa et al., 2017</xref>). Because ZIKV infection may recruit leukocyte to the brain and induce neuron lesion and death (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jurado et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mustafa et al., 2019</xref>), it is possible that later BBB disruption may be triggered by inflammatory response rather than ZIKV-induced proteasomal degradation.
