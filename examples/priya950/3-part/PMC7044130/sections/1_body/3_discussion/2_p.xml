<p>Several lines of evidence showed the existence of ZIKV antigens in the chronic villi of a human placenta from a mother who gave birth to an infant with microcephaly (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Calvet et al., 2016</xref>), and isolation of ZIKV RNA from placental tissue of mice infected with the ZIKV (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Caine et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the ZIKV may penetrate the placental barrier to infect the infant brain. Recent studies reported that the ZIKV is able to infect and replicate in Hofbauer cells that are primary human placental macrophages and in cytotrophoblasts, suggesting a route of intrauterine transmission that the ZIKV crosses the fetal compartment by directly infecting the placental cells (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Quicke et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we revealed that the ZIKV could cross the placenta barrier with both paracellular and transcytosis (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Mateo et al., 2015</xref>). However, our data revealed that ZIKV infection causes leakage of the placental barrier by disrupting the integrity of the tight junction of the barrier cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Further investigation elucidated that the breakdown of the tight junction in the placental barrier cells is due to a decrease in the amounts of ZO-1 and occludin, two essential tight junction proteins, through the proteasomal degradation pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast to the direct infection pathway (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Quicke et al., 2016</xref>), our results proposed a paracellular pathway for the ZIKV crossing the placental barrier by disrupting the cellular tight junction of the barrier cells through degradation of ZO-1 and occludin. The activation mechanism of the proteasomal degradation pathway by ZIKV infection remains to be further investigated.
