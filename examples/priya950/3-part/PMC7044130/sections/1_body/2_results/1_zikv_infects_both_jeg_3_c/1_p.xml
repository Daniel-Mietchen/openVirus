<p>To investigate the mechanism of the ZIKV crossing the placental barrier and the BBB, we infected JEG-3 cells, which are derived from trophoblast cells of the placenta and commonly used in plancental barrier studies, and hCMEC/D3 cells, which are the immortalized human brain capillary endothelial cell lines frequently employed in studies of the BBB (

To first clarify the infectivity of the ZIKV in JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 cells, the viral envelop (E) protein was detected by immunofluorescence staining with an anti-ZIKV E protein antibody at 24 h post-infection. Apparently, the ZIKV E protein was detected in both cell lines in a dosage-dependent manner (
