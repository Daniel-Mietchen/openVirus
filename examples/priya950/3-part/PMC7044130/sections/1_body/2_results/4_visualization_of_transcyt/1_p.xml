<p>It has been reported that transcytosis, a series action to transport macromolecules intracellularly through the vesicular system, is a common strategy for molecules crossing impermeable barriers under normal physiological condition (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Tuma and Hubbard, 2003</xref>). Therefore, we would like to conduct a single-virus imaging analysis to investigate whether ZIKV particle can also cross barriers cells by transcytosis in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> Transwell barrier models. To visualize single ZIKV particles directly, ZIKV particles were labeled with a fluorescence dye, atto647N, by conjugating atto647N-NHS ester with the amino group of the viral envelope protein. The atto647N-labeled ZIKV particles were purified through a Sephadex G-25 size-exclusion column. Compared to the fractions containing the 40 nm fluorosphere (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, solid squares) indicated atto647N-labeled ZIKV particles (atto647N-ZIKV) because the diameter of a single ZIKV particle is approximately 50 nm (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sevvana et al., 2018</xref>). No fluorescence signal was detected within the same range of fractions from the Dye-free ZIKV group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, solid triangles). These results confirmed a successful conjugation of ZIKV particles with atto647N. The infectivity of atto647N-ZIKV particles was then measured by a plaque assay. Both dye-free ZIKV and atto647N-ZIKV presented similar virus titers, suggesting no significant influence on ZIKV infectivity by the atto647N labeling procedure (
