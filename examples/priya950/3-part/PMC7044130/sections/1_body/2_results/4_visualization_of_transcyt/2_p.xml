<p>Given that transcytosis is a characteristic pathway of intracellular trafficking that allows a selective and rapid transcellular transport from the apical side to the basolateral side within a cell, and the intracellular transport is a temperature-dependent process that can be inhibited at 4°C, in contrast to the paracellular transport (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Morad et al., 2019</xref>), we speculated that the energy-dependent intracellular transport of virus particles should be inhibited at 4°C. Therefore, using an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> Transwell barrier assay, we would like to investigate whether the ZIKV can penetrate a monolayer of barrier cells at 4°C and 37°C by directly measuring the fluorescence intensity of atto647N signals in the basal chamber of a Transwell plate. In both JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 cells, atto647N-ZIKV particles were significantly decreased in the basal chamber at 4°C condition, compared to that at 37°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast to atto647N-ZIKV particles, there was no difference of FITC-dextran in the basal chamber of Transwell plate at both 4°C and 37°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results implied that the ZIKV can cross monolayers of either JEG-3 or hCMEC/D3 cells through a temperature-dependent transcytosis. To directly visualize the transcytosis of ZIKV particle across a monolayer of barrier cells, we infected a monolayer of JEG-3 cells on a 3.5 cm glass-bottom plate with Atto647N-ZIKV and acquired confocal imaging at 0, 30, and 60 min post-infection. JEG-3 cells were stained with DAPI and WGA488 to indicate the positions of nucleus and cell membrane, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, Atto647N-ZIKV particles were only detected on the surface of the JEG-3 monolayer at the initial time point (0 min). Apparently, Atto647N-ZIKV particles were internalized into cytoplasm and moved from the apical side to the basal side of the cells at 30- and 60-min post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). The similar results also can be observed in hCMEC/D3 monolayers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results elucidated that ZIKV particles might be directly transported across the monolayer of barrier cells by transcytosis without undergoing the viral replication process.
