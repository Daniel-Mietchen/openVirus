<p>To further investigate the regulatory mechanism of ZIKV-induced decreased of ZO-1 and occludin expression, mRNA levels of these two proteins isolated from JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 cells in the absence or presence of ZIKV infection were determined by RT-qPCR. The results of RT-qPCR depicted no significant change of mRNA level of ZO-1 and occludin in both JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 cells regardless of ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A,B</xref>). These data suggested that the down regulation of ZO-1 and occludin expression in JEG-3 cells might be regulated at the post-transcription level. To confirm this speculation, prior to ZIKV infection, JEG-3 cells were treated individually by a series of pharmacological inhibitors including bafilomycin (BFA), MG132, and chloroquine (CQ), which target either autophagic or proteasomal degradation pathways, the two major cellular pathways mediating protein degradation. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, the expression of ZO-1 and occludin repressed by ZIKV infection could be notably rescued only by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, but not by either BFA, an inhibitor for both V-ATPase-dependent acidification and autophagosome-lysosome fusion or CQ, an inhibitor for fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Taken together, these results demonstrated that ZIKV infection causes the leakage of the placenta barrier through the disruption of cellular tight junction via the proteasomal degradation pathway.
