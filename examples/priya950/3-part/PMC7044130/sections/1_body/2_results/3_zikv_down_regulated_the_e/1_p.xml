<p>Given that the leakage of FITC-dextran was increased by ZIKV infection in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> placenta barrier model but not in the BBB barrier model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C,D</xref>), it raised a possibility that the disruption of the tight junction of JEG-3 is associated with the barrier leakage because the tight junctions of trophoblasts epithelial cells bear critical barrier functions for protection against a paracellular spread of various pathogens, including viruses (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Delorme-Axford et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate this hypothesis, the expression of two tight junction proteins, ZO-1 and occludin were examined in JEG-3 as well as hCMEC/D3. The results of the western blotting assay clearly depicted a decreasing expression of ZO-1 and occludin in JEG-3 cells in the presence of ZIKV infection compared to that in the mock control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, there was no significantly different expression of ZO-1 and occludin between the ZIKV-infected group and the mock control group in hCMEC/D3 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To further confirm the disruption of tight junction by ZIKV infection in JEG-3 cells, the distribution of ZO-1 and occludin were detected by an immunofluorescence assay. Confocal imaging revealed that tight junctions formed continuous seals between adjacent cells in the absence of ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, ZIKV infection disrupted the continuity of occludin and ZO-1 in JEG-3 cells (white arrows in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel). The integrity of junctional ZO-1and occludin of JEG-3 cells was quantified by measuring the branch length of segments. The results demonstrated that ZIKV infection declined the integrity of tight junction of JEG-3 cells (
