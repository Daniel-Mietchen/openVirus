<p>Endocytosis recognized as the responsible mechanism of molecule transcytosis inside the cells contains various pathways including caveolae-dependent endocytosis, clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. To further examine endocytic pathways for ZIKV entrance into barrier cells, we pretreated barrier cells with pharmacological inhibitors including Nystatin, chlorpromazine (CPZ), and dimethyl amiloride (DMA), which specifically inhibit caveolae-dependent endocytosis, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and micropinocytosis, respectively. Colchicine, an inhibitor to prevent microtubule polymerization was used to disrupt intracellular trafficking. The concentration of inhibitors used in the current study did not cause cytotoxicity or increase cellular permeability in both JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 cells (

To further quantify the effect of inhibitors on the ZIKV crossing barrier cells, the titers of ZIKV isolated from the basal chamber 3 h post-infection were determined by a plaque assay. The results depicted that all four inhibitors reduced viral titers in the basal chamber, compared to that in the control group (
