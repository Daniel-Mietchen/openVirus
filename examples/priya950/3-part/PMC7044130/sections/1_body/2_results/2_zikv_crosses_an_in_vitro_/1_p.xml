<p>Next, we established an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> Transwell barrier assay to investigate whether the ZIKV can cross barrier cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 cells were, respectively, seeded on the apical chamber of the inserts, which contained a permeable membrane, of a 24-well Transwell plate. The inserts were then placed on a 24-well companion plate containing pre-seed adherent Vero cells in the basal chamber. ZIKV was added on the top of the inserts at a MOI of 0.5. If ZIKV particles could cross barrier cells, they would exist in the basal chamber and infect into Vero cells. The existence of the ZIKV in Vero cells was detected by immunostaining using an anti-ZIKV E protein antibody. The results showed clearly that the ZIKV E protein could be detected in Vero cells in either JEG-3 and hCMEC/D3 cells as barrier cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results indicated that the ZIKV could cross the human physiological barrier cells. It is possible for the ZIKV to cross barrier cells by altering the permeability of barrier cells. To investigate this possibility, the permeability of the cells was examined by using FITC-dextran as an indicator in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> Transwell barrier assay. FITC-dextran was added in the apical chamber after 24 h post-infection. If ZIKV infection could alter cell permeability, the signal of FITC-dextran should be detected in the basal chamber. Compared with the mock group, ZIKV infection did increase FITC-dextran signal significantly when JEG-3 cells were used as barrier cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, there was no significant change of the FITC-dextran signal between the mock group and the ZIKV-infected group when hCMEC/D3 cells were used as barrier cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) that can increase cell permeability was used as a positive control. These results suggested that the ZIKV may cross the placenta barrier by changing the permeability of the barrier cells. In contrast, the ZIKV crosses the BBB barrier cells but does not change the permeability of the BBB barrier cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B,C</xref>), suggesting no barrier leakage when the ZIKV crossed the BBB.
