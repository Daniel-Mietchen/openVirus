  <p>A schematic diagram depicts the mechanism of the ZIKV crossing human physiological barriers. In the placenta barrier, ZIKV infection can lead to disruption of tight junction that results in the ZIKV crossing through the leakage of tight junction. In addition, the ZIKV can also transport from the apical side to the basolateral side through the transcytosis pathway (top panel). In the blood-brain barrier, the ZIKV can transport from the apical side to the basolateral side through the transcytosis pathway, but does not alter the permeability of the barrier (bottom panel).</p>
