  <p>ZIKV infection decreased the accumulation of tight junction proteins through post-transcription regulation. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The mRNA levels of ZO-1, Occludin and ZIKV-E in JEG-3 cells upon ZIKV infection were quantified by RT-qPCR. Data were normalized by GAPDH. The fold changes of mRNA were compared with the mock group. The mRNA levels of ZO-1, Occludin and ZIKV-E in hCMEC/D3 upon ZIKV infection are shown in 
   <bold>(B)</bold>. The error bars represent standard deviations from three independent experiments. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Western blotting depicts the accumulation of ZO-1 and Occludin in JEG-3 cells with various inhibitors treatments upon ZIKV infection. The amount of ZO-1 and Occludin was normalized by GAPDH. The fold changes of protein expression compared with the mock group in each term were quantified in the right panel. The error bars represent standard deviations from three independent experiments. *
