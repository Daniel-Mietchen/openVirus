  <p>ZIKV crossed 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> human physiological barriers. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> A schematic diagram depicts a virus crossing 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> barrier cells. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The immunofluorescence images of the ZIKV E protein revealed ZIKV-infected Vero cells cultured in a basal chamber through a JEG-3 barrier at a MOI of 0.5 or hCMEC/D3 barrier at MOI of 10 at 24 h post-infection. The ZIKV E protein antibody was recognized by an Alex488-secondary antibody (green). Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 50 μm. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> FITC-dextran (40 kDa) was used to validate the permeability of a JEG-3 barrier at 24 h post-infection. The FITC-dextran of the basal chamber was collected and analyzed by a plate reader. The fold change of the FITC signal compared with the mock group was drawn in 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. 12.5 μM of EDTA was used as a positive control. The permeability of an hCMEC/D3 barrier at 24 h ZIKV post-infection was measured in 
   <bold>(D)</bold>. The error bars represent standard deviations from three independent experiments. *
