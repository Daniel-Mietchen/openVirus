  <p>ZIKV infection decreased expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1 and Occludin in JEG-3 but not hCMEC/D3. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Western blotting depicted that the amount of ZO-1 and Occludin decreased in JEG-3 cells at 24 h post-infection. The amount of ZO-1 and Occludin was normalized by β-actin and GAPDH, respectively. Comparison with the mock group was quantified in the right panel. Statistical differences were obtained through 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests. **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Western blotting depicted that the expression of ZO-1 and Occludin were not affected in hCMEC/D3 cells with ZIKV infection. The amount of ZO-1 and Occludin was normalized by GAPDH, and quantified in the right panel. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The distribution of ZO-1 and Occludin in JEG-3 cells with/without ZIKV infection were imaged by confocal microscopy. The white arrows indicate the disruption of ZO-1 and Occludin. Scale bar, 20 μm. The tight junction integrity of ZO-1 and occludin were measured by the Skeletonize plug-in of ImageJ software. The length of segments in each group (
   <italic>n</italic> = 50) were measured and quantified as right histograms. **
