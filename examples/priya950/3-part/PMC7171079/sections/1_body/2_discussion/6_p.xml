<p id="Par22">In recent years, more and more novel enteroviruses have been detected; this is closely related to the high recombination frequency between enteroviruses. This high-frequency recombination promotes the evolution of enteroviruses, but also leads to the emergence of recombinant enteroviruses with unknown aetiology and epidemiology, such as EV-B83 reported in this study, which shows a high resistance to temperature and higher prevalence than previously reported novel enteroviruses (such as EV-B106 and EV-B80). We should strengthen the monitoring of these novel enteroviruses and use a variety of emerging technologies to improve the detection rate in specimens in order to identify those that may cause outbreaks as early as possible
