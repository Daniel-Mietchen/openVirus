<p id="Par18">The full-length genomic sequences of six Tibet EV-B83 strains were highly similar. Comparison of these sequences with that of the EV-B83 prototype strain showed that their insertion and deletion sites were identical and all located in the

 <italic>-UTR</italic> region. Although the six EV-B83 strains came from different areas of Tibet, the high consistency in sequences indicates that they may share a common origin, and EV-B83 may have a relatively limited spread between the two places.
