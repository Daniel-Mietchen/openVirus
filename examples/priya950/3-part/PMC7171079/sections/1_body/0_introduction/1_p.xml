 </sup>. Human enteroviruses include over 100 types, comprising poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, and some newly discovered enteroviruses. Human enterovirus can cause various infectious diseases, including acute flaccid paralysis (AFP); hand, foot, and mouth disease; acute aseptic meningitis; encephalitis; and others. Human enterovirus is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded positive RNA virus of approximately 7500 nucleotides (nt), including a 5′-untranslated region (UTR), single long open reading frame (ORF), and
