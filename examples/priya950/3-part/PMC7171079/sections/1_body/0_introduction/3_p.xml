<p id="Par4">Enterovirus B83 (EV-B83) is a novel type within EV-B. The prototype strain (CA76-10392/USA/1976) of EV-B83 was isolated in the United States in 1976 and first reported in 2007. The GenBank database contains only two full-length genomic sequences of EV-B83: those of the EV-B83 prototype strain isolated in the United States

 <italic>246/YN/CHN/08HC</italic>) isolated in Yunnan, China
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, there are only 12 
 <italic>VP1</italic> sequences of EV-B83 that are over 600 nt in length in GenBank, and there are few studies and reports on EV-B83.
