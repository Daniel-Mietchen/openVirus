 </sup>; therefore, further study of its epidemiology and other characteristics is necessary. In this paper, we will describe six Tibet EV-B83 strains from the following aspects: genome-wide sequence characteristics, phylogenetic relationships, recombination characteristics, epidemiological characteristics.
