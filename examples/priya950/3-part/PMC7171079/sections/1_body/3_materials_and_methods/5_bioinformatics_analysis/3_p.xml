<p id="Par33">Meanwhile, BLAST was used to analyse the 
 <italic>P2</italic> and 
 <italic>P3</italic> sequence regions of the six strains, and full-length sequences with over 85% similarity in GenBank were obtained as potential parents. We used the Recombination Detection Program 4 (RDP4, v4.46) for preliminary recombination analysis and selected RDP, GENECONV, Chimaera, MaxChi, Bootscan, SiScan, and 3Seq for recombination detection

 </sup>. For recombinant analysis, we set 
 <italic>P-</italic>values less than 0.01 to obtain more accurate results. We only considered sequences supported by at least three RDP4 methods as potential parental sequences. Since BLAST showed that the 
 <italic>P3</italic> region of some CV-A9 strains had high similarity with the 
 <italic>P3</italic> region of six Tibet EV-B83 strains, we downloaded the full-length genomic sequences of the most similar CV-A9 strains in the GenBank database as potential parents. The CV-B6 and EV-B106 strains (GenBank accession numbers AF039205 and KF990476) in the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the 
 <italic>P2</italic> and 
 <italic>P3</italic> regions were closest to six Tibet EV-B83 strains and were also used as potential parents. We continuously screened a variety of potential parents using the SimPlot program (200-nt window moving in 20-nt steps) and the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree to obtain more reliable potential parental sequences.
