<p id="Par32">EV-B83 sequences longer than 600 nt were obtained from GenBank database, and sequences containing the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region were screened out. After comparison, some 
 <italic>VP1</italic> coding regions (633 nt in length and located in the EV-B83 prototype strain at nt 2528–3160) were selected to construct phylogenetic trees. For evolutionary analysis, we also selected the sequences of EV-B prototype strains in the GenBank, Yunnan EV-B83, and six Tibet EV-B83 strains to construct the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees of 
 <italic>VP1</italic>, 
 <italic>P1</italic>, 
 <italic>P2</italic>, and 
 <italic>P3</italic> coding regions. The sequences were processed by ModelGenerator0.85 to confirm GTR  + G model as the best model, and the maximum-likelihood tree was constructed in MEGA7 with 1000 bootstrap replicates
