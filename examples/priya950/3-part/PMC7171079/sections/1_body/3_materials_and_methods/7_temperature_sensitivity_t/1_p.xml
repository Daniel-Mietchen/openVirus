<p id="Par35">In 24-well plates, monolayer RD cells were used to determine the temperature sensitivity of six purified EV-B83 strains, and temperature-sensitive and temperature–resistance strains (
 <italic>HTPS-QDH11F/XJ/CHN/2011</italic> and 
 <italic>HTYT-ARL-AFP02F/XJ/CHN/2011</italic>, respectively) were selected as control strains

 </sup>. Then, 50 μL of undiluted strains were inoculated into 24-well plates and cultured in incubators at optimal and supraoptimal temperatures for viral culture (36 and 39.6 °C, respectively). After 1 h, the unadsorbed virus was removed, and 100 μL maintenance medium was added to each well. The 24-well plates were incubated at 36 or 39.5 °C, and the virus was harvested at 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h post-infection. The 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by the end-point dilution method on monolayer RD cells in 96-well plates at 36 °C. If the titre of the same virus isolate at different temperatures at the same time point were reduced by more than two logarithms, the strain was considered to be temperature-sensitive
