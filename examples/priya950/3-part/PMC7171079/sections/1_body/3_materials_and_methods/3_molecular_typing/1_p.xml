<p id="Par29">Viral RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Then one-step RT-PCR Kit (Perfect Real Time, TaKaRa, Dalian) was used to detect RNA of enteroviruses by enterovirus-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (Real-Time PCR). If the Real-Time PCR result is positive, the partial 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region sequence was obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification using the PrimScript One-Step RT-PCR Kit Ver. 2 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) with primers E486/E488 (EV-A universal primers), E490/E492 (EV-B universal primers)and E494/E496 (EV-C universal primers)

 </sup>. The amplified products were further purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Each strand was sequenced from both directions at least once using the ABI 3130 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The obtained sequences were identified by the Online Enterovirus Genotyping Tool
