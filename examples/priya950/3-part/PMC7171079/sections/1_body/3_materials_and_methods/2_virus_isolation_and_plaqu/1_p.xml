 </sup>; then, samples were inoculated into human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and a mouse cell line with the human poliovirus receptor (L20B). Both cell lines were supplied by the WHO Global Poliovirus Specialized Laboratory in the United States and purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were continuously observed after inoculation for seven days, and the culture was harvested if cells showed a complete EV-like cytopathic effect (CPE). If no CPE appears after 7 days, perform a blind passage and continue examination for a further 7 days.
