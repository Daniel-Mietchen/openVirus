 <sup>−2</sup>, 10
 <sup>−3</sup>, 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, 10
 <sup>−5</sup>), and the diluted culture was inoculated into 6-well culture plates containing RD cells. Incubate at 35 °C for 2 hours, add agar medium without neutral red solution, and invert at 37 °C for 2 days, then add agar medium with neutral red solution, culture in the dark (35 °C) after staining, and observe for seven days. After the appearance of white spots, appropriate plaques were selected and inoculated into RD cell culture tubes, after CPE appeared, they were passaged twice and cultures were collected.
