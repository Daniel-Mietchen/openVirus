<p id="Par8">The six Tibet EV-B83 strains were 7396 nt in length with a single 6552 nt ORF encoding a polypeptide of 2184 amino acids. The 
 <italic>5</italic>′
 <italic>-UTR</italic> and 
 <italic>3</italic>′
 <italic>-UTR</italic> comprised 744 and 100 nt, respectively. The base composition of all six EV-B83 strains was 28.2–28.3% A, 23.8–23.9% T, 23.5–23.6% C, and 24.3–24.4% G. We compared the genome-wide sequences of six EV-B83 strains with that of the EV-B83 prototype strain (
 <italic>CA76-10392/USA/1976</italic>) and found that the nucleotide insertion and deletion sites in the six EV-B83 strains were identical and located in the 
 <italic>5</italic>′
 <italic>-UTR</italic> region, all of which had two nucleotide insertions at position 101, one at position 152, and three at position 722. There was one nucleotide deletion at position 129 and three at position 695. Pairwise comparisons of the nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences were conducted among the six Tibet EV-B83 strains, the prototype strain of all EV-B strains, and the Yunnan EV-B83 strain (
 <italic>246/YN/CHN/08HC</italic>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We also compared the nucleotide similarity between the 
 <italic>P1</italic>, 
 <italic>P2</italic>, and 
 <italic>P3</italic> regions of the six EV-B83 strains and those of the prototype EV-B strain. In the 
 <italic>P1</italic> region, the six EV-B83 strains had the highest nucleotide similarity with the Yunnan EV-B83 and EV-B83 prototype strains. However, in the 
 <italic>P2</italic> and 
 <italic>P3</italic> regions, the six Tibet strains had the highest nucleotide similarity with CV-B6 (GenBank accession number AF039205) and EV-B106 (GenBank accession number KF990476), respectively. These indicate that the six Tibet strains EV-B83 may show recombination with other EV-B strains in the 
 <italic>P2</italic> and 
 <italic>P3</italic> regions. The nucleotide and amino acid similarities among the full-length genomic sequences of six Tibet EV-B83 strains were 97.9–99.9% and 99.1–100.0%, respectively, while those between the six strains and the EV-B83 prototype strain were 81.0–81.1% and 96.4–96.6%, respectively.
