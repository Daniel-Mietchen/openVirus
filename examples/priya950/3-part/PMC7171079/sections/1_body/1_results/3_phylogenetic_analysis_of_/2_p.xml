<p id="Par10">Based on the sequences of all EV-B prototype strains in the GenBank database and those of the Yunnan EV-B83 strain and the six Tibet EV-B83 strains, we constructed phylogenetic trees based on 
 <italic>VP1</italic>, 
 <italic>P1</italic>, 
 <italic>P2</italic>, and 
 <italic>P3</italic> coding regions, respectively (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Both 
 <italic>VP1</italic> and 
 <italic>P1</italic> phylogenetic trees showed that the six Tibet EV-B83 strains were clustered with the EV-B83 prototype and Yunnan strains with a 100% bootstrap value, which confirmed previous molecular typing results. However, the phylogenetic trees constructed based on the 
 <italic>P2</italic> and 
 <italic>P3</italic> coding regions showed different results. In the 
 <italic>P2</italic> region, the six Tibet EV-B83 strains were clustered with the CV-B6 prototype strain (GenBank accession number AF039205) and the E-12 prototype strain (GenBank accession number X79047). In the 
 <italic>P3</italic> region, they were clustered with EV-B106 (GenBank accession number KF990476). This is consistent with previous results regarding nucleotide similarities. It is also suggested that six Tibet EV-B83 strains may have recombination in the 
 <italic>P2</italic> and 
 <italic>P3</italic> coding regions, leading to a large difference in the nucleotide sequence between them and the previously isolated EV-B83 strains in these regions.
