<p id="Par16">After the six Tibet strains were cultured at 36 °C and 39.5 °C, the titre test showed that they were not temperature-sensitive strains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Although their replication ability varied slightly at different temperatures, differences in the titre at 36 °C and 39.5 °C did not exceed two logarithms, and their logarithmic growth curves at the two temperatures were also highly similar. Unlike the previously reported temperature-sensitive EV-B106 and some temperature-sensitive EV-A90 strains, six Tibet EV-B83 strains is more temperature resistant.
