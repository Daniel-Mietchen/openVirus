  <p>Recombination analyses of the four Tibet EV-B83 strains with CV-A9 strains. (
   <bold>a</bold>) EV-B83 Tibet group as the query sequence. Similarity and bootscanning analysis performed by Tibet EV-B83 group with EV-B83 prototype strain (
   <italic>CA76-10392/USA/1976</italic>), EV-B83 Yunnan strain (
   <italic>246/YN/CHN/08</italic>), EV-B80 (
   <italic>HZ01/SD/CHN/2004</italic>), EV-B106 (
   <italic>148/YN/CHN/12</italic>), and CV-A9 group. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the (
   <bold>b</bold>) 
   <italic>P1</italic>, (
   <bold>c</bold>) 
   <italic>P2</italic>, and (
   <bold>d</bold>) 
   <italic>P3</italic> regions of the above sequences. Among these, purple and red branches in (
   <bold>b</bold>â€“
   <bold>d</bold>) represent the EV-B83 Tibet and CV-A9 groups, respectively. Each branch colour coincides with the colour of the similarity and bootscanning analysis results.
