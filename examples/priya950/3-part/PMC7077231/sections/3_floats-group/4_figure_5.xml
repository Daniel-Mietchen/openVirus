  <p>Genetic characterization of Odorna virus (OdV) and Cavally virus (CAVV). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Genome structure showing ribosomal frameshift (RFS) in the genome. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The maximum likelihood tree of OdV and CAVV were constructed with conserved amino acid domains in genome sequences, with Genbank accession numbers LC497422 and LC497421, respectively, extracted using MAFFT 7 online version [
   <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and the Gblocks program [
   <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The genetic relationship between OdV, CAVV, and previously reported alphamesoniviruses were shown on the maximum likelihood tree with bootstrap support from 1000 bootstrap replicates indicated by values on branches.
