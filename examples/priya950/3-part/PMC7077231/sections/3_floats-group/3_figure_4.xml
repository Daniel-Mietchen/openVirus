  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of Culex flavivirus (CxFV) and cell-fusing agent virus (CFAV). MAFFT 7 online version [
   <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and the Gblocks program [
   <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] were combined to extract the conserved amino acid domains in CxFV and CFAV genome sequences with Genbank accession numbers LC504568 and LC496857, respectively. The conserved domains were subsequently used in constructing a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, with 1000 boostraps, to determine the relationship between CxFV detected in Ghana and other known CxFV and the cell fusing agent virus clade (
   <bold>A</bold>). The partial nucleotide sequence of NS5 domains of CFAV (Genbank accession number LC496857) was used in determining the phylogenetic position of CFAV from Ghana in relation to previously reported CFAV strains (
   <bold>B</bold>). Bootstrap support, from 1000 bootstrap replicates, are indicated by values on the branches.
