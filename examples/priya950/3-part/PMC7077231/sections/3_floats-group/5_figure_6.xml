  <p>Genetic characterization of West Accra virus (WAV) and Goutanap virus. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Genome structure of WAV showing the representation of the capsid protein on a PAGE gel. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Growth rate of WAV in C6/36 cells. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Phylogenetic relationship between WAV, Nelorpivirus, and Goutanap virus (GoNV), Sandewavirus. The maximum likelihood tree of WAV and GoNV was constructed with conserved amino acid domains in genome sequences with Genbank accession numbers LC496489 and LC504569, respectively. The conserved domains were extracted using MAFFT 7 online version [
   <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and the Gblocks program [
   <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The bootstrap support, from 1000 bootstrap replicates, are indicated by values on the branches.
