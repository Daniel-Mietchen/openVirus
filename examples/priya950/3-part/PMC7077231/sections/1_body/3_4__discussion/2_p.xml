<p>Morphological techniques were combined with DNA barcoding to determine the presence and distribution of mosquito species in Ghana. The high density and distribution of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in Ghana raise concerns about the possible risk of arboviral outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The detection of 
 <italic>Aedes hirsutus</italic>, which has been implicated as a vector of ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], is an example of the diversity of possible vectors of arboviruses in Ghana. The detection of 
 <italic>Aedes lilii</italic> in Ghana, the non-vector cryptic species of the yellow fever vector 
 <italic>Aedes bromeliae</italic>, affirms the need to combine molecular techniques with morphological identification when using entomological surveillance to estimate the risk of outbreaks [
