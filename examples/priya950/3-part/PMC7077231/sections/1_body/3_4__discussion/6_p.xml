<p>The characterization of ISVs helps in understanding the evolutionary history and trends in potentially important and medically important viruses. The discovery of viruses of the genus 
 <italic>Jingmenvirus</italic> (MoCV), for example, in which two segments have a direct evolutionary relationship with non-segmented flaviviruses, suggests that segmented viruses may be the mid-point in the evolution from non-segmented to multipartite viruses, based on the principle of parsimony [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Finding and characterizing novel viruses, therefore, is helpful in deepening our understanding of RNA viruses and may influence future interventions that can prevent, or control, arboviral outbreaks.
