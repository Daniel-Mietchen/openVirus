<p>Mosquito larvae were collected from water puddles, artificial containers, tree holes, manholes, gutters/waste channels, and used tires. Larval mosquitoes were transferred to the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research and reared to adults. Once emerged, adult mosquitoes were morphologically identified using taxonomic keys [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and were pinned as voucher specimens and stored at the Department of Medical Entomology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Japan. A leg was removed from the dry-pinned specimens, and DNA was extracted using the alkaline method [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The PCR reaction was performed with PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) under the following conditions: 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 5 s. PCR products were purified from agarose gels after size verification and sequenced using the 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA). All sequences were submitted to the NCBI database (
