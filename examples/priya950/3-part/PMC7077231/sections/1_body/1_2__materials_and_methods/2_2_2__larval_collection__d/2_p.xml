<p>Prior to morphological identification and DNA barcoding, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito larvae collected from four different regions (Greater Accra, Volta, Savannah, and Upper West) were reared to adults, blood fed and allowed to lay eggs. Their progeny (F
 <sub>1</sub>) was used to establish four different laboratory colonies: GH 23 (Hohoe, Volta Region), GH 98 (Larabanga, Savannah Region), GH 106 (Jirapa, Upper West Region), and GH 115 (Tesano, Greater Accra Region). The second-generation (F
 <sub>2</sub>) post larval collection was subjected to virome analysis.
