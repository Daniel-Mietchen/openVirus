<p>Plaque purification was performed on CPE-causing single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses using previously described protocols, with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A monolayer of C6/36 cells was inoculated with serially diluted virus stock in a six-well culture plate. The inoculum was removed after virus adsorption, and cells were covered with 1% agarose media. Plaques were harvested after 4 days post inoculation. Plaques were singly suspended in a culture medium to propagate the purified virus.
