<p>Virus isolation was performed using a previously described method with modifications [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A maximum of 36 mosquitoes per pool were homogenized in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Sigma-Aldrich), 200 U/mL penicillin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 200 μg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies), 5 μg/mL fungizone (Life Technologies); and filter sterilized. The filtrate was used as the inoculum for virus isolation, and the residue was screened for medically important mosquito-transmitted arboviruses.
