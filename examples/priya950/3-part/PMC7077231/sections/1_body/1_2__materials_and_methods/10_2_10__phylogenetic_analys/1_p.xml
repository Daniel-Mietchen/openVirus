<p>Multiple alignments of nucleotide and amino acid sequences were performed using MAFFT 7 online version [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The Gblocks program [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was used for the extraction of conserved domains/sequences of aligned sequences. Finding suitable amino acid substitution models and constructing dendrograms was carried out on MEGA ver. 6 [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The maximum likelihood method, with 1000 bootstrap replicates, was used in constructing all the dendrograms. Bootstrap support is indicated by values on branches.
