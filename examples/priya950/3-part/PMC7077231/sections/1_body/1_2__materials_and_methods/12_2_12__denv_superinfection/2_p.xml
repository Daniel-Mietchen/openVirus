<p>AaTV-infected C6/36 cells were seeded in a six-well plate at 28 °C/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> overnight. The cells were inoculated with the Dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1; D1/Hu/Saitama/NIID100/2014) with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and 1. Cell supernatants were harvested on days 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 post-inoculation. The detection and quantification of DENV-1 were done by focus-forming assay using mAb4G2-antibody produced from D1-4G2-4-15 mouse hybridoma cells (ATCC HB-112, American Type Culture Collection), Dako EnVision+ System-HRP Labeled Polymer Antimouse, and DAKO Liquid DAB+ Substrate Chromogen System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The viral titers were plotted against time. The experiments were run in triplicates, and all experiments were run with controls.
