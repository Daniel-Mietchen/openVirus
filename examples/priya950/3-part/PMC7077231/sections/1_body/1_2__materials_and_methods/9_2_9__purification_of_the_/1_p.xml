<p>The plaque-purified ssRNA virus was propagated in C6/36 cells, and the resulting supernatant was concentrated using the YM-50 centrifugal filter unit (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The virus particle was subsequently purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The concentrated supernatant was layered on a 20%â€“70% linear sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 84,000 g overnight. The observation and collection of the viral band were aided by illumination. The harvested layer was dialyzed in TNE buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). Analysis of the purified virus particle was done on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel.</p>
