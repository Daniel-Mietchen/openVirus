<p>Two ssRNA viruses of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> were detected in the 2016 surveillance. Cell-fusing agent virus (CFAV) was detected in only male and female 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes collected in the Greater Accra region, whereas Culex flavivirus (CxFV) was found in the Greater Accra and Savannah Regions, but only in female 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes (
