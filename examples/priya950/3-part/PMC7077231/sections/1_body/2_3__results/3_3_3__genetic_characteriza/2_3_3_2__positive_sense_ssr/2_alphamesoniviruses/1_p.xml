<p>A novel alphamesonivirus, Odorna virus (OdV), and the previously reported Cavally virus (CAVV) were detected in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the Greater Accra region. OdV was detected in only male 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, whereas CAVV was detected in both sexes of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00147-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Both viruses belong to the genus 
 <italic>Alphamesonivirus-1</italic> with a ribosomal frameshift (RFS) between ORF 1a and 1b (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00147-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The conserved slippery sequence GGAUUUU was found in the ORF 1a/1b overlap region [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This RFS facilitates the expression of ORF 1b [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
