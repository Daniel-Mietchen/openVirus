<p>Tesano Aedes virus (TeAV), a novel unclassified virus of the family 
 <italic>Iflaviridae</italic>, was detected in both sexes of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, but only in female 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. TeAV was detected in the Greater Accra and Volta regions (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00147-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The genome of TeAV consists of a single ORF with poly-A tract at the 3’ end. The VPg protein and internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), both of which are involved in translation of viral RNA and RNA replication [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], are predicted to be bound to the 5’ end and in the 5’-untranslated region of the viral genome, respectively (

 <italic>Iflaviridae</italic>.
