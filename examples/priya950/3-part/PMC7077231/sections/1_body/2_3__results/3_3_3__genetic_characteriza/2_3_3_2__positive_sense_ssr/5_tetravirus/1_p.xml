<p>A novel tetravirus of the family 
 <italic>Permutotetraviridae</italic> designated Culex permutotetra-like virus (CxPTV) was detected in female 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes in the Western and Savannah regions in 2016 (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00147-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The closest related viruses, Sarawak virus and Shinobi tetravirus, were reported to be detected in male 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> cell lines, respectively, whereas the remaining two viruses in the clade were detected in spiders and
