<p>Mole Culex virus (MoCV) is a novel multi-component Jingmenvirus detected in female 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes collected in the Savannah region in 2016 (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00147-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Jingmenviruses typically have five segments and are closely related to the non-segmented flaviviruses. The fifth and smallest segment is not always present in infections and does not play any role in viral replication [

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Consistent with the findings in this study, MoCV has a genome comprised of at least four separately packaged segments (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00147">Figure S2</xref>). The first two segments were both monocistronic coding for non-structural (NS) domains, similar to the conserved NS5 and NS3 domains in flaviviruses. The remaining segments contained three ORFs each with a predicted RFS. The conserved slippery sequences -GGAUUUU and -AAAAAAC were found in segments three and four, respectively (
