<p>In this study, a single negative-sense RNA virus, Phasi Charoen-like Phasivirus (PCLV), was detected. PCLV was detected in both sexes of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in three regions in 2016. PCLV is one of three reported viruses in the genus 
 <italic>Phasivirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> and is a tripartite virus with three segments encoding an RdRp (L), a glycoprotein (M), and a nucleocapsid (S). All three segments were detected in this study (

 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> viruses and the genus Goukovirus (
