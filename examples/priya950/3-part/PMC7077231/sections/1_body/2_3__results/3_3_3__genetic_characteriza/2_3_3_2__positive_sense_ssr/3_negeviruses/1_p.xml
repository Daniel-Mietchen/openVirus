<p>Two viruses of the Negevirus clade in the genera 
 <italic>Nelorpivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sandewavirus</italic> were detected in 2015 and 2016, respectively. West Accra virus (WAV), a novel nelorpivirus, was detected in both sexes of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes collected in the Greater Accra region, whereas Goutanap virus, a sandewavirus, was detected in only female 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes collected in the Western region (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00147-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Both viruses were found to have three ORFs. ORF 1, the largest ORF, codes for methyl transferase, helicase, and the RdRp. The smallest ORF (ORF 3) in the WAV genome, which is made up of 205 amino acids and codes for the capsid protein, was represented on an SDS-PAGE gel (
