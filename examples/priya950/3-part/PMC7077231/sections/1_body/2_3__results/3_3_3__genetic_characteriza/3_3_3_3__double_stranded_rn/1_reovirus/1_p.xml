<p>Aedes pseudoscutellaris reovirus (APRV) was the only virus detected in both 2015 and 2016. APRV was detected in both sexes of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and female 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00147-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). APRV belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Dinovernavirus</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00147-f012">Figure 12</xref>). Consistent with the previously reported strain, nine segments of APRV were detected in this study (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00147-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The terminal sequences of all nine segments were determined to be completely identical to the previously reported APRV except segments 6, 8, and 9 which had one nucleotide substitution each (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00147-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As the name suggests, the reported strain of APRV was detected in 
 <italic>Aedes pseudoscutellaris</italic> cell lines, making this the first detection of APRV in wild mosquitoes and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], suggesting a preference for mosquitoes in the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>.
