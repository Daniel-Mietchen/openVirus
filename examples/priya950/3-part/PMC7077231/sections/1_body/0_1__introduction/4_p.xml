<p>Due to the close interaction between mosquito vectors and arboviruses, the spatial distribution of a vector has been used to estimate the risk of arboviral infection or outbreak, as well as the population at risk (PAR) of infection, particularly in Africa, where there are gaps in the information pool [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 2015, 831 million people in Africa were estimated to be at risk of infection with at least one of the four major 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> transmitted arboviruses: YFV, DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although these estimates may affect policy and help prevent outbreaks, they also draw attention to the absence of information on the true disease burden. Nonetheless, the collection of information on the species and sub-species of mosquitoes located in each country/region remains crucial in vector control.
