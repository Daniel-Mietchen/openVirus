<p>The key findings of this study, summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, are that: (1) influenza vaccination is effective in reducing viral burden and weight loss in mice; (2) in both vaccinated and unvaccinated mice, NK cells ameliorate disease (weight loss) at the expense of delaying viral clearance; (3) that the magnitude of the effect on disease is greater in vaccinated than unvaccinated mice (2.5-fold greater weight loss vs. 1.11-fold, respectively), and (4) the depletion of any “memory” NK cells that might have been induced by vaccination did not alter the response to influenza virus in vaccinated mice. These data suggest that NK cells play an important homeostatic role, allowing influenza virus to be controlled without causing severe disease, and that this effect is enhanced by vaccination—indicating a role for NK cells in regulating the adaptive immune response. Our study therefore supports previous data suggesting an important role for NK cells in moderating adaptive immune effector mechanisms (
