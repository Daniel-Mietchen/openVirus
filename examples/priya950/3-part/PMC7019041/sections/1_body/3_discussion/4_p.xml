<p>The mechanisms by which NK cells moderate adaptive immune responses are not fully understood. Our observation that NK cell depletion tended to increase neutrophil influx into the lungs of influenza infected mice, and significantly increased neutrophil accumulation in lungs of vaccinated mice, suggests that NK cells may serve to limit neutrophil migration to sites of infection. This would be in line with studies showing that neutrophils are important in controlling influenza virus infection (
