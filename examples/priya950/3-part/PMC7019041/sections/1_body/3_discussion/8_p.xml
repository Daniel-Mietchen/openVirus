<p>In mice, cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells can be adoptively transferred and maintained by homeostatic proliferation (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) and work by Li et al. has demonstrated that NK cells generated in the liver following primary infection can reduce influenza viral burden in the lung upon secondary challenge in 
 <italic>Rag1</italic>-deficient mice (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, to date, memory-like NK cells have not been demonstrated after influenza vaccination and the contribution of either tissue-resident or blood-derived “memory” NK cells during a robust recall response in B/T-cell intact mice has yet to be characterized. In addition, human studies have been limited to peripheral blood and further investigations are needed to test how NK cells influence inflammatory cellular infiltrates at the site of virus infection. Vaccination and challenge studies (with local mucosal sampling for virus, cellular infiltrates and cytokine production) are now needed to reveal the impact of vaccine-induced NK cell priming and “memory” generation on virus replication and pathology.
