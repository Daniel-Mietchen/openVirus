<p>In humans, memory-like NK cells can be generated by cytokine or influenza virus pre-activation; these cells show enhanced responses to cytokines or influenza virus upon re-stimulation (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). It is conceivable that prior activation of NK cells, for example by vaccine-induced inflammatory cytokines, could influence the migration and function of these cells upon viral challenge. Certainly, human nasal challenge with Fluenz induces a local (nasal mucosal) innate cytokine signature with potential NK cell activating capacity (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Nevertheless, we wondered whether a similar phenomenon might also be apparent in this mouse model (where more precise dissection of the underlying local mechanism of NK cell enhancement might be possible). Therefore, we depleted NK cells immediately after vaccination (thus removing any putative “memory” NK cells, defined as cells with altered function after prior exposure), and rested the mice for 3 weeks to allow repopulation before challenging with influenza virus. We observed no differences in the outcome of influenza infection between these NK cell-depleted/repopulated vaccinated mice and intact, vaccinated mice. These data suggest that “memory” NK cells are not induced by influenza vaccination in mice or that any such cells are no more effective at moderating adaptive responses to influenza than are “naïve” NK cells.
