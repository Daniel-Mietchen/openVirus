<p>To summarize, we have demonstrated that NK cells play a homeostatic role in adaptive immunity to influenza infection in mice. While the precise mechanism by which NK cells modulate adaptive immunity remains unclear, their presence is crucial for resolving infection with minimal immune pathology. Further studies to determine the mechanism(s) at play may inform the design of safer and more effective influenza vaccines.</p>
