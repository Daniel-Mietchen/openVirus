<p>Influenza burden in lung-purified ribonucleic acid (RNA) was determined by one-step quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the HA gene, as previously described (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). RNA was isolated from 500 μL of frozen lung cell supernatant (PureLink Viral RNA Mini Kit, Thermo). As a standard, RNA was isolated from stock virus (128 HAU/mL) and diluted 1:5 starting from 2.3 HAU equivalents per well. Purified RNA (5 μL of 25 μL elution) was mixed with 5 μL of TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step Master Mix (Thermo), 7 μL of ultra-pure water, and 1 μL each of forward primer SWH1-1080 (0.8 μM, GATGGTAGATGGATGGTACGGTTAT), reverse primer SWH1-1159 (0.8 μM, TTGTTAAGTAATYTCGTCAATGGCATT), and probe SWH1-1128 (0.25 μM, FAM-AGGATATGCAGCCGACCT-NFQMGB) with amplification conditions: 55°C, 30 min; 95°C, 2 min; 40 cycles of 95°C, 15 s and 60°C, 30 s, on a 7900HT Fast RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Loughborough UK). For viral burden from whole lung tissue, 500 ng of purified RNA (as reported below) was assayed in the same manner as above.
