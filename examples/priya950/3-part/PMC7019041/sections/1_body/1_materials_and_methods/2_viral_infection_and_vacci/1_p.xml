<p>Egg grown influenza A/California/4/2009 virus was kindly provided by Dr. John McCauley (Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, London UK) at 128 hemagglutination units (HAU)/mL and stored at −80°C until use. For infections, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) and then inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 30 μL of virus (0.5 HAU) diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Gibco, Loughborough UK). Mock-treated control mice were inoculated similarly with DPBS. Mice were monitored and weighed daily to assess infection and euthanized at day 4 post-infection (p.i.), or if they reached the humane endpoint of 20% loss of body weight at an earlier time point. Twenty eight days prior to challenge, some mice were vaccinated by i.p. injection of the human 2015–2016 seasonal influenza vaccine [human Sanofi-Pasteur-MSD inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (split-virion) containing influenza haemagglutinin (HA), including A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like strain NYMC X-179A], diluted 1:3 in DPBS with 500 μL per mouse with a final dose of 5 μg of each HA.</p>
