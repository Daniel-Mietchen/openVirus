<p>C57BL/6J and C57BL/6-Gt(ROSA)26Sor
 <sup>tm1(HBEGF)Awai</sup>/J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories via Charles River (Tranent, UK). C57BL/6-NKp46:iCre
 <sup>+/+</sup> mice were kindly provided by Professor Eric Vivier (Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Institut Universitaire de France, France). C57BL/6-Rosa26iDTR
 <sup>+/+</sup> and C57BL/6-NKp46:iCre
 <sup>+/+</sup> mice were crossed to generate F1 NKp46-iCre/Rosa26iDTR
 <sup>+/âˆ’</sup> (referred to as NKp46-DTR). Groups of NKp46-DTR mice were age- and sex-matched for all experiments, with influenza challenge occurring between 8 and 10 weeks of age. Both sexes of the F1 generation were used in this study, with 68 female and 106 male NKp46-DTR mice being used in total. The sexes of mice used in each experiment are shown in the figure panels ({M} male, {F} female) and figure legends. All mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages in a specified pathogen free facility.
