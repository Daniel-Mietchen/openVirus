<p>Lungs were aseptically removed from euthanized mice and stored in 5 mL DPBS on ice until processing. Lung single-cell suspensions were obtained using methods previously described (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Briefly, isolated lungs were cut into 2–3 mm
 <sup>2</sup> sections and resuspended in 5 mL digestion solution of Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 5 mM GlutaMax (Gibco), 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco), and 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin solution (10,000 units/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough UK). Digestion solutions contained DNAseI (20 μg/mL) (Roche, Basel Switzerland), and LiberaseTM (0.2 digestion units/lung) (Roche). The lung suspensions were digested at 37°C for 60 min with gentle rotating and then processed on a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi, Surrey UK). Lung homogenates were then sieved through a 40 μm nylon filter to remove debris (BD Biosciences, Berkshire UK) and sieve washed with 5 mL DPBS. After centrifugation, an aliquot of lung supernatant was frozen at −70°C for downstream viral qPCR and IL-6 protein ELISA. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 5 mL ACK Lysis Buffer (Lonza, Edinburgh UK), washed and resuspended with DPBS for flow cytometry.
