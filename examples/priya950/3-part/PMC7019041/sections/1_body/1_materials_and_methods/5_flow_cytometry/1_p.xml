<p>Cells were stained in 96-well U-bottom plates as described previously (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Briefly, cell suspensions were stained with antibodies to cell surface markers, fixed (Cytofix/Cytoperm; BD Biosciences). Antibodies and dyes used for flow cytometry staining are shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Cells were acquired on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FACSDIVA software. Data were analyzed using FlowJo V10 (Tree Star). Gates were initially set on singlets, followed by leukocytes (removing high SSC-A and low FSC-A) and live cells. Subsequent gates were based on unstained and/or FMO controls.
