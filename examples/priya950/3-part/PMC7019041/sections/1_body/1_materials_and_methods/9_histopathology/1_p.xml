<p>Sections were cut at 4 μm thickness from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded whole lung tissues and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) by the University of Edinburgh Easter Bush Pathology Laboratory and scored, in a blinded fashion, for inflammation (vasculitis, bronchiolitis, and alveolitis), oedema (perivascular oedema, peribronchiolar oedema, and alveolar oedema), leukocyte infiltration (perivascular, peribronchiolar, and in alveolar walls) and neutrophil infiltration (perivascular, peribronchiolar, and in alveolar walls). Each criterion was scored numerically as unremarkable (0), mild (1), mild to moderate (2), moderate (3), moderate to marked (4), and marked (5). Photomicrographs of histological sections were taken using a 20× objective with an Olympus BX41 microscope using an Olympus DP72 camera.</p>
