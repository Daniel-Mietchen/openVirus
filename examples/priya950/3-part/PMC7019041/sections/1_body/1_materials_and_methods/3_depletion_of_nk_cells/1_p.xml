<p>For selective depletion of NK cells, NKp46-diphtheria toxin receptor (NKp46-DTR) mice were injected i.p. with 1.25 μg DT (diluted in 100 μL DPBS) on days 25 and 28 post-vaccination. Alternatively, mice were injected once with 2.5 μg DT and allowed to recover for 3 weeks prior to influenza challenge. Control (mock depleted) NKp46-DTR mice were injected i.p. with 100 μL DPBS.</p>
