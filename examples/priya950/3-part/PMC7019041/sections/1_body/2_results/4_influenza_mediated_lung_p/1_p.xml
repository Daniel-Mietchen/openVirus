<p>Given the decreased viral burden but increased weight loss upon influenza challenge in vaccinated NK cell-depleted mice compared to NK cell-sufficient mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, males and 3A, females), we examined the lungs for histological evidence of pathology. H&amp;E stained lung sections were assessed for pulmonary inflammation (vasculitis, bronchiolitis, and alveolitis), edema (perivascular, peribronchiolar, and alveolar), and infiltrating lymphocytes and neutrophils (perivascular, peribronchiolar, and alveolar) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Datasheet 2</xref> for individual mouse data). Influenza infection alone induces severe pathology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, while weight loss was more severe in vaccinated and influenza challenged NK-depleted mice than in NK cell-sufficient mice, pathological changes in the lungs were significantly different only between unvaccinated and NK-depleted miceâ€”and not between vaccinated and NK-depleted mice (
