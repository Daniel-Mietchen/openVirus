<p>To characterize the role of NK cells in influenza infection and immunization, we established a model of acute influenza infection in C57BL/6J mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). C57BL/6J mice were infected i.n. with 0.5 HAU of influenza strain A/California/04/2009. Infected mice developed an acute infection, losing 20% of their body weight by 4 days post-infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and had lower viral burden in their lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) compared to unvaccinated mice; the reduction in influenza burden in the lung correlated with reduced weight loss (
