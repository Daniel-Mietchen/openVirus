<p>Acute influenza infection was marked by a significant increase in the frequency of CD11b+ cells in the lung, with a decrease in proportions of T (%CD3+) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S12</xref>). The frequency of NK cells, identified by NK1.1 and NKp46 co-expression (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), did not change after influenza infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, gating 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S13</xref>), indicating increased activation (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and expression of NKp46, an activating NK cell receptor reported to bind influenza-derived HA (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), was also increased in infected animals. Lastly, there was a significant increase in the frequency of NK cell activation marker CD69 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the immune response to acute influenza infection, whether in a naïve or vaccinated animal, is characterized by an influx of CD11b+ cells and activated NK cells.
