<p>Given that vaccinated NK cell-depleted animals lost more weight than vaccinated NK cell-intact animals despite a lower viral burden (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), we next looked at inflammatory markers in the lung and plasma. In agreement with data from lung supernatants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, males), viral burden determined from whole lung RNA preparations was significantly lower after NK cell depletion in unvaccinated animals, and not in vaccinated animals (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.08) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, females). While 
 <italic>Il6</italic> and 
 <italic>Ifn</italic>γ expression were increased with influenza infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), regardless of vaccination status and viral burden (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), transcripts of 
 <italic>Il6</italic> were not significantly changed in NK cell depleted mice, while 
 <italic>Ifn</italic>γ showed a trend for a decrease in NK cell depleted mice (
