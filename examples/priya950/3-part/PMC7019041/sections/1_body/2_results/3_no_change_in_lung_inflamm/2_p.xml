<p>Given that neutrophil influx into an influenza-infected lung can enhance viral control (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), but can also contribute to tissue damage through the release of extracellular traps (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), we wondered whether increased neutrophil activity in NK cell-depleted mice might explain our findings. We therefore determined transcript levels of neutrophil chemokines (
 <italic>Cxcl1, Cxcl2)</italic> and neutrophil secreted protein 
 <italic>Lcn2</italic> but found no significant differences in transcript concentrations between NK cell-deficient and NK cell-intact animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Lastly, we assessed circulating levels of IL-6 [which have been implicated in neutrophil-mediated effects (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)] and found no significant difference in plasma or lung supernatant IL-6 concentration in either vaccinated or unvaccinated NK-depleted mice compared to NK cell-intact mice (
