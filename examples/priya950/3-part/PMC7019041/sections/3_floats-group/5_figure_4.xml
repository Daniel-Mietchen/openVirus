  <p>NK cell depletion in vaccinated, influenza-challenged mice does not alter pathology. Four days post infection in the model described in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, whole lungs were excised, stored in 10% formalin, and embedded on paraffin for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Pathology was scored for: 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Inflammation (vasculitis, bronchiolitis, and alveolitis), Edema (perivascular, peribronchiolar, and alveolar), Leukocytes and Neutrophils (in perivascular space, peribronchiolar space, and alveolar wall). Full scoring details in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Files</xref>. Pathology scores from females {F} (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4–8/group) is compiled from two independent experiments, with each independent experimental data shown in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S6</xref>. Dots represent individual female {F} mice with bars showing mean. Significance determined by Mann–Whitney test, ns, not significant. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Representative photomicrographs of pathological changes observed. Arrows, bronchiolitis with exudates in bronchiolar lumina. 
   <sup>*</sup>Perivascular and peribronchiolar edema. Scale bar in mock equals 50 μm.
