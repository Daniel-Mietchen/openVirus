  <p>NK cell depletion reduces lung viral burden and increases weight loss in vaccinated, influenza-challenged mice. Transgenic C57BL/6 mice with NKp46 driven expression of diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor were vaccinated 28 days prior to intranasal influenza (flu) challenge, as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Immediately prior to infection, a subset of mice received two intraperitoneal injections of DT (1.25 μg). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Levels of NK1.1+, NKp46+ NK cells in the lung, as a proportion of singlet, live leukocytes at 4 days post infection (necropsy, nx). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> At 4 days post infection, lung cell-free supernatants were analyzed by qPCR for influenza viral burden (plotted against a dose curve of IFA with known HAU, giving HAU equivalents). 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Weight loss (mean ± SEM) followed for 14 days post challenge, one experiment (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4–5/group) 
   <bold>(E–F)</bold> Weight loss at day 4 post challenge. Data from males {M} (
   <italic>n</italic> = 9–10/group) is compiled from two independent experiments and females {F} (
   <italic>n</italic> = 9–13/group) from three independent experiments, with each independent experimental data shown in
