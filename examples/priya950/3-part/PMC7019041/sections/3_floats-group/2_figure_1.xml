  <p>Primary influenza infection induces rapid weight loss and NK cell activation in lung but vaccination reduces weight loss and lung viral burden. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> C57BL/6 female mice were challenged intranasally with 0.5 hemagglutination units (HAU) of influenza A/California/4/2009 (Flu) or mock treated with DPBS (Mock). Four weeks prior to challenge, mice were vaccinated intraperitoneally with the trivalent Sanofi influenza vaccine (Vac). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Weight loss (mean ± SEM) over 4 days. 
   <bold>(B–F)</bold> At day 4 post infection, lungs were excised and cell-free supernatant was analyzed by qPCR for influenza viral burden (plotted against a dose curve of Flu with known HAU, giving HAU equivalents) 
   <bold>(C)</bold> and plotted against weight loss 
   <bold>(D)</bold>. Data fitted to a non-linear regression line with R square value shown 
   <bold>(D)</bold>. 
   <bold>(E,F)</bold> Lung cell pellets were analyzed by flow cytometry for 
   <bold>(E)</bold> cellular abundance and 
   <bold>(F)</bold> Natural Killer (NK) activation markers. Data is compiled from two independent experiment (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5–11/group), with each independent experimental data shown in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S1</xref>, 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>. Dots represent individual mice with bars showing mean. Significance determined by Mann–Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic>-test, ns, not significant.
