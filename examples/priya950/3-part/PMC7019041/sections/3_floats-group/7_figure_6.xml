  <p>Depletion of NK cells after vaccination, and subsequent repopulation, does not alter lung viral burden, disease severity or systemic inflammation after challenge. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Transgenic C57BL/6 mice with NKp46 driven expression of diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor were vaccinated 42 days (d) prior to intranasal influenza (Flu) challenge and treated with DT (NK-depleted) 21 days prior to challenge with necropsy (nx) at 4 days post influenza challenge. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> At 3 and 21 days post DT treatment, lungs were excised and single cells isolated for flow cytometry for the proportion (%) of NK1.1+, NKp46+ NK cells. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Weight loss at 4 days post influenza challenge. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Lung cell-free supernatants were analyzed by qPCR for influenza viral burden (plotted against a dose curve of Flu with known HAU, giving HAU equivalents). 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Plasma levels of IL-6 (pg/mL). Data from males {M} (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4â€“10/group) is compiled from two independent experiments, with each independent experimental data shown in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S10</xref>. Dots represent individual mice with bars showing mean. Significance determined by Mann-Whitney test, ns, not significant.
