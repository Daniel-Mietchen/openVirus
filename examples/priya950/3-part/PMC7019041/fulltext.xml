Here, we hypothesized that NK cells might increase viral clearance but possibly at the expense of increased severity of pathology. On the contrary, we found that NK cells serve a homeostatic role during influenza virus infection of vaccinated mice, allowing viral clearance with minimal pathology. Using a diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mouse model, we were able to specifically deplete NKp46+ NK cells through the administration of diphtheria toxin. Using this model, we assessed the effect of NK cell depletion prior to influenza challenge in vaccinated and unvaccinated mice. NK-depleted, vaccinated animals lost significantly more weight after viral challenge than vaccinated NK intact animals, indicating that NK cells ameliorate disease in vaccinated animals. However, there was also a significant reduction in viral load in NK-depleted, unvaccinated animals indicating that NK cells also constrain viral clearance. Depletion of NK cells after vaccination, but 21 days before infection, did not affect viral clearance or weight loss&#x02014;indicating that it is the presence of NK cells during the infection itself that promotes homeostasis. Further work is needed to identify the mechanism(s) by which NK cells regulate adaptive immunity in influenza-vaccinated animals to allow efficient and effective virus control whilst simultaneously minimizing inflammation and pathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NK cell</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>diphtheria toxin</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Medical Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000265</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="54"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="8299"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza viruses are a significant cause of respiratory tract infections, leading to seasonal epidemics and unpredictable pandemics. Globally, influenza affects ~20&#x02013;30% of children and 5&#x02013;10% of adults, resulting in 3&#x02013;5 million cases of severe illness with up to 500,000 deaths, annually (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The very young, old, and immunocompromised are at greatest risk of succumbing to severe illness and death (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Currently, vaccination with live-attenuated or inactivated influenza virus is the most effective method for reducing infections at both the individual and population level (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Although adaptive immune responses play a key role in the resolution of influenza infection, innate immune responses play an essential role in restricting virus replication and thus limiting the scale of the initial infection (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Amongst other innate immune players, Natural Killer (NK) cells can kill virus-infected cells and help to orchestrate nascent adaptive immune responses (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Defects in NK cells are associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). NK cell killing is mediated by cell surface cytotoxicity receptors (such as the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46) binding to viral components or stress-induced ligands on the surface of virus-infected cells, leading to directed release of granzyme- and perforin-containing cytotoxic granules and/or Fas/Fas-ligand interactions (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Additionally, cytokine (particularly interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;) production by NK cells plays an integral role in shaping adaptive immunity (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). For example, NK-derived IFN-&#x003b3; can activate dendritic cell migration, thus promoting T cell priming (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Evidence for the importance of NK cells in influenza virus infection comes primarily from studies in mice, although conclusions vary depending on the precise model employed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S1</xref>). For example, depletion of NK cells with anti-asialo GM1 antibody in mice and hamsters resulted in increased morbidity and mortality from influenza A virus infection (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In addition, influenza infection is lethal in mice lacking the NK cell specific receptor NKp46 (NCR1) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), which has been reported to be a receptor for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Conversely, others have reported that NK cell deficiency [whether through depletion with anti-asialo GM1 or anti-NK1.1, or due to a lack of interleukin (IL)-15] reduced weight loss and increased survival (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Moreover, little is known regarding the role of NK cells in vaccine-induced immunity to influenza. We set out, therefore, to address the role of NK cells during acute influenza infection, before and after vaccination, using diphtheria-toxin (DT) mediated ablation of NK cells in mice in which NKp46 expression drives co-expression of the DT receptor. Given that IL-2 produced from influenza-specific T cells is dependent on the NK cell driven IFN-&#x003b3; response in early influenza infection (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), we hypothesized that NK cell ablation would impair viral clearance and increase disease severity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6J and C57BL/6-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(HBEGF)Awai</sup>/J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories via Charles River (Tranent, UK).

There were no obvious effects of infection or vaccination on the frequency of CD19+ B cell populations in the lung; the modest apparent increase in B cell proportions in NK cell-depleted mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) may simply reflect distortion of cell percentages by the absence of NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>, gating <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S16</xref>).

These data suggest that NK cells play an important homeostatic role, allowing influenza virus to be controlled without causing severe disease, and that this effect is enhanced by vaccination&#x02014;indicating a role for NK cells in regulating the adaptive immune response.

Although we used the A/California/4/2009 strain of influenza rather than PR8 strain used by Zhou et al. we used an infecting dose that is similar to the low dose used by Zhou et al. (0.5 HAU) and saw a similar trend. Interestingly, an opposite effect was seen during murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection where NK cells prevented pathology at high viral doses but enhanced disease at low doses (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>Although we saw a clear impact of NK cell depletion on the post-vaccination response to influenza in both male and female mice, we did observe some sex-specific differences in our data. Whilst we do not have a complete, replicated set of all data in both sexes at every time point, limiting our ability to draw specific conclusions regarding the impact of sex on the role of NK cells during influenza infection and vaccination, we found that NK cell-depleted unvaccinated male mice (but not female mice) lost significantly more weight than intact mice after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E,F</xref>) despite the two sexes having similar viral loads. We also observed that female mice generated higher titres of neutralizing antibodies after influenza challenge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S11C</xref>), confirming previous work with PR8 virus by Lorenzo et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Sex differences in response to influenza infection and influenza vaccination have been noted in mice and in humans [reviewed by (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)] however, many previous studies to determine the role of NK cells during acute influenza infection mice have used male or female mice only, or have failed to define the sex of the mice used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S1</xref>). Future work should consider the impact of sex on the role of NK cells during a recall response to viral infection.</p><p>The mechanisms by which NK cells moderate adaptive immune responses are not fully understood. Our observation that NK cell depletion tended to increase neutrophil influx into the lungs of influenza infected mice, and significantly increased neutrophil accumulation in lungs of vaccinated mice, suggests that NK cells may serve to limit neutrophil migration to sites of infection. This would be in line with studies showing that neutrophils are important in controlling influenza virus infection (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) but can contribute to severe pulmonary pathology (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><p>Another possibility is that NK cells regulate the accumulation of adaptive, cytotoxic (CD8+) effector T cells at the site of infection, thereby reducing tissue damage but slowing viral clearance. In RSV infection, for example, CD8+ cells are directly associated with weight loss and depleting them reduces disease (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). NK cells have been shown to eliminate activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in different model systems (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), mediated by either perforin or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). However, thus far, in influenza vaccination models CD8+ T cells appear to contribute to both reduced viral load and reduced disease severity (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Due to limitations of cell numbers, we were unable to characterize the responsiveness of T cells in this study and therefore further work is needed to determine whether the lack of NK cells removes the brake on adaptive T cell responses during influenza infection.</p><p>In a recent study (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), murine NK cells licensed on self MHC were shown to localize to infected lung tissue and produce IFN-&#x003b3; after influenza A (strain PR8) infection. Unlicensed NK cells, in contrast, were enriched in draining (mediastinal) lymph nodes, produced GM-CSF and promoted dendritic cell infiltration and CD8+ T cell responses. It is therefore likely that distinct subsets of NK cells may selectively promote inflammation or antiviral immunity. Furthermore, this may differ depending on levels of adaptive immunity.</p><p>In humans, memory-like NK cells can be generated by cytokine or influenza virus pre-activation; these cells show enhanced responses to cytokines or influenza virus upon re-stimulation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). It is conceivable that prior activation of NK cells, for example by vaccine-induced inflammatory cytokines, could influence the migration and function of these cells upon viral challenge. Certainly, human nasal challenge with Fluenz induces a local (nasal mucosal) innate cytokine signature with potential NK cell activating capacity (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Nevertheless, we wondered whether a similar phenomenon might also be apparent in this mouse model (where more precise dissection of the underlying local mechanism of NK cell enhancement might be possible). Therefore, we depleted NK cells immediately after vaccination (thus removing any putative &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; NK cells, defined as cells with altered function after prior exposure), and rested the mice for 3 weeks to allow repopulation before challenging with influenza virus. We observed no differences in the outcome of influenza infection between these NK cell-depleted/repopulated vaccinated mice and intact, vaccinated mice. These data suggest that &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; NK cells are not induced by influenza vaccination in mice or that any such cells are no more effective at moderating adaptive responses to influenza than are &#x0201c;na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; NK cells.</p><p>In mice, cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells can be adoptively transferred and maintained by homeostatic proliferation (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) and work by Li et al. has demonstrated that NK cells generated in the liver following primary infection can reduce influenza viral burden in the lung upon secondary challenge in <italic>Rag1</italic>-deficient mice (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, to date, memory-like NK cells have not been demonstrated after influenza vaccination and the contribution of either tissue-resident or blood-derived &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; NK cells during a robust recall response in B/T-cell intact mice has yet to be characterized. In addition, human studies have been limited to peripheral blood and further investigations are needed to test how NK cells influence inflammatory cellular infiltrates at the site of virus infection. Vaccination and challenge studies (with local mucosal sampling for virus, cellular infiltrates and cytokine production) are now needed to reveal the impact of vaccine-induced NK cell priming and &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; generation on virus replication and pathology.</p><p>There are some important caveats to keep in mind, however. Firstly, in contrast to previous studies using mice lacking NK cells at the time of infection or vaccination, or depleted of NK cells with antibodies on animals of different sexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S1</xref>), we used an inducible, endogenous method of NK cell depletion which may have fewer limitations (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Nevertheless, DT treatment alone lead to some limited weight loss and pulmonary pathology, likely due to death of ~15% of lung leukocytes, although there was no induction of inflammatory cytokines nor any influx of immune cells into the lung. It remains a possibility, therefore, that the mild inflammation induced by NK cell depletion may have affected the outcome of the experiments. Further, sex differences in influenza-mediated lung pathology have been noted (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Secondly, the ethically-approved humane end point for our study was deemed to be 20% weight loss (after which animals were euthanized), essentially precluding determination of long-term survival after NK cell depletion but some studies have shown only limited correlation between weight loss and long term survival (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), with viral challenge dose a greater predictor of survival despite similar weight loss kinetics (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). A further caveat of the Rosa-DT conditional &#x0201c;NK cell&#x0201d; depletion system used here is a potential parallel depletion of mature NKp46+ ILC1 and ILC3 cells (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Studies in deficient <italic>ncr1</italic><sup>gfp</sup> mice, which are susceptible to lethal influenza A infection, demonstrate systemic loss of ILC1, whilst maintaining NKp46 negative NK cell subsets (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Although rare in the non-pathologic lung, our studies do therefore not exclude a potential contribution of ILC-1s to inflammatory processes after influenza vaccination or challenge infection. Lastly, characterization of cytokine protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid would be beneficial in understanding transcriptional changes observed in this study.</p><p>To summarize, we have demonstrated that NK cells play a homeostatic role in adaptive immunity to influenza infection in mice. While the precise mechanism by which NK cells modulate adaptive immunity remains unclear, their presence is crucial for resolving infection with minimal immune pathology. Further studies to determine the mechanism(s) at play may inform the design of safer and more effective influenza vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by the animal welfare and ethical review board of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
