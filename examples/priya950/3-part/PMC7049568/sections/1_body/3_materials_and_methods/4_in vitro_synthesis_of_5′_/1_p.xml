<p id="p0085">The sequences of the NS1 gene segment from 12 different influenza A viruses were aligned using NCBI tblastn to find the most conserved regions to serve as the universal target sense sequence in DNA templates. shRNAs based on these target sequences were designed with the guidance of mppRNA.

 </xref> Nine sequences were tested for knockdown efficacy. Sequences #1 (5′-GTGATGCCCCATTCCTTGA-3′), #4 (5′-TGAGGATGTCAAAAATGCA-3′), and #9 (5′-ATAAAAAACACCCTTGTTTCTACT-3′) were found to be the most effective in knocking down NS1 message and protein of influenza viruses used in this study, and #4 was used subsequently for the rest of the experiments. As a control, we used Is9.2, a 19-mer shRNA (5′-AGCUUAACCUGUCCUUCAA-3′), with 5′-PPP that did not target NS1 and its m7G-capped counterpart.
