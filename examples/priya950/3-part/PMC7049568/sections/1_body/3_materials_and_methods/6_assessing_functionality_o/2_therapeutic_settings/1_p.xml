<p id="p0105">To study the therapeutic potential of 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA, A549 cells were first infected with A/Brisbane/59/2007 influenza virus at an MOI of 1.0 with trypsin supplementation for 6, 12, or 24 h, followed by transfection with 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic>-transcribed 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA, 5′-PPP-scramshRNA, Is9.2 5′-PPP-RNA, or their m7G-capped counterparts. Cell lysates and supernatants were harvested 24 h post-transfection to perform various assays. Three independent experiments were performed under both prophylactic and therapeutic settings with three time points (6, 12, or 24 h), and each treatment was done in duplicate cultures.
