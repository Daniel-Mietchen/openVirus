<p id="p0100">A549 (six-well tissue culture plates) were transfected with 3 μg/well (as optimized by dose-response study) of 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic>-transcribed 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA, 5′-PPP-scramshRNA, control Is9.2 5′-PPP-RNA, or their 7mG-capped counterparts using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), as per manufacturer’s instructions. At 6, 12, or 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with A/Brisbane/59/2007 influenza virus at an MOI of 1.0 with trypsin supplementation. At 24 h post-infection, cells were harvested for RNA and protein analysis, and supernatants were collected for determination of viral titer by plaque assay using MDCK cells, as described previously.
