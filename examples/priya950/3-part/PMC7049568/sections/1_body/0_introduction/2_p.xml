<p id="p0015">Innate immunity is the first line of defense. Cells recognize molecular patterns associated with pathogens with a conserved set of pathogen recognition receptors located on the cell surface, in vesicles, or in the cytosol.

 </xref> Among cytosolic pathogen sensors, we and others have shown that retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is a major pathogen sensor for influenza virus, and its activation is inhibited by nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus.

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Short single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) containing a 5′-triphosphate (5′-PPP) end or longer ssRNAs without a 5′-PPP end from viruses have been shown to activate RIG-I.
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> We have shown earlier that activation of the RIG-I pathway confers protection against not only drug-sensitive and -resistant strains of influenza independent of their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) type, pathogenicity, and pandemic potential, but also against Ebola virus.

  <sup>24</sup>
 </xref> In addition, activation of the RIG-I pathway did not generate resistant strains. Because a significant proportion of the human population has defects in type 1 interferon (IFN) induction, as well as activation pathways, the RIG-I-mediated antiviral pathway will not work in that population.

 </xref> Hence we have developed a dual strategy that silences NS1 (needed for the population that has defects in type 1 IFN induction/activation pathways) and at the same time it activates the antiviral RIG-I pathway (in type 1 IFN-sufficient population), and demonstrate that it is efficacious against influenza virus infection in prophylactic and therapeutic settings, both
