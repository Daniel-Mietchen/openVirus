<p id="p0045">To assess the ability of NS1shRNA and its capped counterparts, as well as scrambled shRNA, to reduce viral titers both in a prophylactic and a therapeutic model 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we administered one dose of RNA constructs formulated with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>-jetPEI, intranasally, on days −1, 0, 1, 2, and 3, and infected all mice on day 0 with A/PR/8/34 virus. The control consisted of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>-jetPEI alone with PBS. We harvested lungs on day 4 post-infection to measure viral titers by plaque assay and RIG-I, NS1, IFN-β, IFN-λ, and RANTES by quantitative real-time PCR (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). A single-dose administration of NS1shRNA, scrambled shRNA, and m7G-capped NS1shRNA on day −1 (24 h prior to virus infection) in a prophylactic model reduced viral titers by 2 logs (or 90% reduction) (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A) with a corresponding 3 log decrease of NS1 expression (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), 50- to 60-fold upregulation of RIG-I (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C), 150- to 250-fold increase in IFN-β expression (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D), 70- to 75-fold increase in IFN-λ expression (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E), and 30- to 35-fold increase in RANTES expression (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F). These findings clearly indicate that a single dose of 5′-PPP-shRNA results in NS1 suppression and RIG-I activation, and suppresses influenza viral replication significantly. However, single-dose administration on the same day of infection or 24 h post-infection, albeit less effective than day −1 administration, did result in a significant decrease in viral replication and NS1 expression with corresponding increases in RIG-I, IFN-β, IFN-λ, and RANTES in a therapeutic setting. However, delayed administration on day 2 or 3 was less effective, with modest or no desirable protective response.
