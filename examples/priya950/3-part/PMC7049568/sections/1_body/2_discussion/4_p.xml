<p id="p0065">In a prophylactic setting 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, administration of 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA 24 h prior to infection resulted in a 2 log reduction in viral titers for 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA, m7G-capped-NS1shRNA, and 5′-PPP-scrambled NS1shRNA (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A) with corresponding increases in RIG-I, IFN-β, IFN-λ, and RANTES and a concomitant decrease in NS1 mRNA. In a therapeutic setting, when NS1shRNA constructs were administered on the day of viral infection and 24 h post-infection, there was a reduction of viral titers by 2 and 1.5 logs, respectively. However, the therapeutic effect was only a 1.5 to 1 log reduction in viral titers when the shRNAs were administered on days 2 and 3. When Svancarova et al.

 <sub>50</sub>). Similarly, using 5′-PPP-NPsiRNA, a 1 log reduction in viral titer was observed.

 </xref> Unlike the earlier observations, our study extended our initial findings demonstrating that activation of the RIG-I pathway results in an antiviral state in cells and showed that a single administration of dual-acting 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA suppresses viral replication &gt;3 logs 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 2 logs 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in a prophylactic setting. In a therapeutic setting, treatment can be delayed up to 24–48 h to have a beneficial effect in viral titer reduction. Furthermore, the ease of administration by the intranasal route, unlike the intravenous route used by others, facilitated targeted delivery and distribution to have the maximal antiviral effects in the target organ. RIG-I activation can be exploited to prevent or treat not only influenza, as shown by us earlier and in this report, but also to treat other viral infectious diseases, including Ebola, and cancer.
