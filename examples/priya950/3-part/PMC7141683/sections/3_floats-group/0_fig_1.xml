  <title>The replication of B/Shanghai/PD114/2018 (B-SH) virus in A549 cells.</title>
  <p>(A) Immunofluorescence analysis of NP expression in A549 cells. The A549 cells were infected with the B-SH virus (MOI = 0.1) virus, and NP expression was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody; the cell nucleus was countstained with DAPI. (B) Growth curve of B-SH virus. The A549 cells in 12-well plates were infected with B-SH virus (MOI = 0.1), and cell culture supernatants were collected at designated time points. The viral titers were identified on MDCK cells by plaque assays. (C) Western blotting analysis of NP expression. The A549 cells were infected with B-SH virus (MOI = 0.1) and collected 4, 8, and 12 h post infection. Then, the cells were lysed, and GAPDH was used as a control.</p>
