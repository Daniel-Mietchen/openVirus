<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231039.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, a heatmap was employed to analyze DEGs at the different time points. As the infection progressed, the number of DEGs gradually increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231039.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), with a total of 3147 up-regulated and 1741 down-regulated genes in infected A549 cells at 12 h, and the DEGs between NC-12 h and IBV-12 h are shown in volcano plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231039.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These results indicate that the response to viral infection was strongly increased at 12 h, with some shared alternations in expression profiles at all points in time.
