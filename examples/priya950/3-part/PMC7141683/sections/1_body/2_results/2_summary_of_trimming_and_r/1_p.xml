<p>Total RNA was extracted from infection cells, cDNA libraries were created and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000, three biological replicates for three different sets of cell samples and time points were used (
 <xref rid="pone.0231039.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We mapped the trimmed reads to the human reference genome database, and the uniquely mapped sequence reads were further analyzed. Approximately 61.6 and 62.9 million raw reads were obtained from the negative control (NC) and 12 h groups, respectively. Finally, the reads were mapped to the clean experimental reads and control reads pools.
