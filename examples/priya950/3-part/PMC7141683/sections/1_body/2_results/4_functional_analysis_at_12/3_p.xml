<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231039.g004">Fig 4</xref>, RNA transport, DNA replication, homologous recombination, base excision repair, and mismatch repair are affiliated with genetic information processing; cell cycle is affiliated with cellular processes; and Epstein-Barr virus infection and malaria are affiliated with human disease, all of which were also enriched. Epstein-Barr virus infection was significantly enriched, suggesting that the host response related to innate immunity caused by IBV infection might be similar to that caused by Epstein-Barr virus infection. The analysis results of the top 15 hits suggest that hosts develop a rapid and robust innate immune response to fight IBV infection, which is consistent with the results of GO enrichment analysis.
