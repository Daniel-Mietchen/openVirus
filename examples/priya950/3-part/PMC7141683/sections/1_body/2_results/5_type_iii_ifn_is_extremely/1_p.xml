<p>The GO enrichment analysis of DEGs showed that DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and mitotic nuclear division were the main types among biological process, indicating that these A549 cell processes were most influenced by IBV-Yamagata infection. In addition, response to virus and the defense response to virus, which are related to host innate immunity, were also enriched. Further analysis found that IFNs and ISGs, especially type III IFNs (L1, L3, and L2) and ISGs such as the IFIT family (

 <italic>2</italic>, 
 <italic>3</italic>, and
