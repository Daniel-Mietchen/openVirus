<p>To verify the gene expression profiles from the RNA-Seq analysis, we picked several DEGs and then confirmed their expression by quantitative RT-PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231039.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and Western blotting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231039.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In addition, the intensities of the bands corresponding to the expression levels of NP protein in the different groups were scanned and analyzed, and the results indicated that 
 <italic>IFIT2</italic> shows the strongest antiviral effect, followed by 
 <italic>RSAD2</italic> and 
 <italic>IFIT1</italic>, which inhibited the expression of NP to 68.4, 64.0, and 52.8%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231039.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Thus, the expression trend of DEGs in the RNA-seq data was consistent with qRT-PCR analysis, indicating that our transcriptome sequencing data were relatively reliable.
