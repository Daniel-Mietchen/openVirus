<p>Type III IFNs have antiviral effects, and the main difference between them is that IFN-L acts in mucosal tissues, including the gut, the respiratory tract, and the reproductive tract, and the antiviral capability of IFN-L is mainly limited to mucosal tissues because of the high levels of expression of the IFN-L receptor in epithelial cells [

Previous studies extensively demonstrate that IFN-L exerts defensive effects via mucosal barriers against enteric viruses that are susceptible to the intestinal tract, influenza A virus which targets the respiratory tract, and the Zika virus that can infect via the reproductive tract [
