<p>Type III IFNs are also related to adaptive immune responses that are initiated by mucosal infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recent vaccination research shows that IFN-Ls can promote adaptive immune responses by boosting the release of thymic stromal lymphopoietin, stimulating adaptive immune responses [

 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Animal experiments demonstrate that type III IFNs specifically enhance influenza A virus-specific IgG and IgA production when the vaccine is administered by the mucosal immune mode [

 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This indicates that Type III IFNs specifically boost mucosal immunity, which should be considered to help design more efficient vaccine immunization programs against viral infections.
