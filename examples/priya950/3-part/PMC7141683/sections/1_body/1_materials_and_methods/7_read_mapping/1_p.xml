 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Gene regions were expanded following read depth, and the operon was obtained. In addition, the whole genome was split into multiple 15,000-bp windows that share 5,000 bp. The latest human reference genome (GRCH38) was used in fasta format for the RNAseq analysis.
