<p>With regards to the risk perception of people, our results showed that the majority of the participants had a moderate-high perceived susceptibility and a moderate-high perceived severity of DENV infection. However, the qualitative data show that people considered it also to be “merely flu-like”. We believe this relatively high perceived disease severity of DENV infection is biased by the knowledge of the participants gained over the last years. It is possible that the participants are aware of the threat of DENV infection and report it, but that on the other hand, they do not really consider DENV infection as a threat as there have hardly been any reports of severe dengue disease on the island. This phenomenon could well be the reason for an initially reduced risk perception of the CHIKV infection. More research is needed to understand the feeling of threat with respect to VBDs among individuals living in Curaçao and to assess the role of other factors, e.g. heuristics, in this context.</p>
