<p>The qualitative data of our study showed how the risk perception regarding CHIKV infection was attenuated due to the lack of RC before the epidemic and how the risk perception was amplified by the increased exposure of information, as well as the direct and indirect experience of the physical manifestation of CHIKV infection in the peak of the chikungunya epidemic. Based on the participantâ€™s narratives, we believe that the media including television, radio, newspapers and interpersonal channels of information played an essential role in the amplification of the risk of individuals, especially in the context of chikungunya. The findings of a recent study published by Chan et al. support our results [

They also found that social media coverage was positively correlated with changes in risk perception while television and newspapers were positively correlated with changes in protective behaviours. These findings revealed that the influence of media on risk perceptions and behaviour could vary by the volume of information and type of channel of information [
