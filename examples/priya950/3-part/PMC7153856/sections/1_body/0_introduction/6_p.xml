<p>As essential as it is, RC in the context of vector/mosquito-borne disease remains a neglected topic in the scientific literature [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although the mentioned studies give useful insights, they fail to explain RC through the individual point of view and in the social context. Therefore in this paper, we aim to understand RC regarding VBDs in the social context and from the audience’s point of view. The audience in this study refers to people that experienced VBDs and that live in Curaҫao. It is essential to take the audience’s perception into account when studying RC because it permits RC experts to understand the audience’s expectations, opinions and beliefs. The aim of this study will be addressed by seeking to understand (I) the user of the channels of information, (II) the risk perception regarding dengue and chikungunya, (III) the influence of cultural schemas on information, perceptions and preferences, and finally (IV) the information channels that individuals consider trustworthy. This knowledge will lead to applicable community-focused health messages and strengthen the preparedness and performance of RC for future epidemics in Curaçao, and other countries vulnerable to VBDs. We will use a mixed-methods approach based on the SARF, HBM, and the cultural schemas theory to investigate RC regarding VBDs.
