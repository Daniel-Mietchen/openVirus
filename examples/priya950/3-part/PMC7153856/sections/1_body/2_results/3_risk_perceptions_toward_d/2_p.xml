<p>In the case of CHIKV infection, the majority of the participants of both FGDs and IDIs did not expect to be infected with CHIKV because they were not informed, before the epidemic, about a possible CHIKV infection outbreak. The qualitative data suggested that the perceived susceptibility and the perceived severity regarding CHIKV infection were attenuated due to the lack of RC. However, both were amplified when the television, radio, newspaper, and people started to share information regarding the high burden of chikungunya during the epidemic. When prompted to discuss gender and age differences related to CHIKV infection, a proportion of the participants of the FGDs and IDIs perceived that the youth was less at risk of CHIKV infection as their immune system was stated to be better than children, adults and older adults. However, the rest of the participants agreed that everyone in the community was susceptible to the condition, regardless of gender and age. The same shared perception was observed among the survey participants as almost half of the participants (47%) reported that not everyone in Cura√ßao ran a high risk of being infected with CHIKV. When participants were asked about the severity of CHIKV infection, all the participants of the qualitative study stated that it was a severe disease and 72% of the participants of the survey fully agreed with this statement. Based on these results, the majority of the participants had a moderate-low perceived susceptibility and moderate-high perceived severity regarding CHIKV infection.</p>
