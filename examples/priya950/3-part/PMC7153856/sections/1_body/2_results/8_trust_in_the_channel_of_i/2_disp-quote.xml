  <italic>“The information regarding the vector of chikungunya was lacking</italic>. 
  <italic>People were not aware of the possible actions that they could take</italic>. 
  <italic>I think that chikungunya is a virus</italic>, 
  <italic>and there is no medication against viruses</italic>. 
  <italic>The consequence is that you cannot walk and as what (female name X) said</italic>, 
  <italic>you need to rest</italic>. 
  <italic>If someone says that he or she has medication for the virus</italic>, 
  <italic>the person needs to know the effect of it</italic>. 
  <italic>I heard that people tried everything that was recommended by the doctors</italic>. 
  <italic>Painkillers were prescribed most of the time</italic>. 
  <italic>This is clear</italic>, 
  <italic>it is not a medication</italic>, 
  <italic>but it helps to reduce the symptoms</italic>. 
  <italic>The consequence was that people got confused because they thought that they got medication to cure the disease</italic>, 
  <italic>while you as a health professional knew that there is no cure</italic>.
