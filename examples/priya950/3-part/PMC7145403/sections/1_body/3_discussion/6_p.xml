<p>Our approach of macro bibliometric analysis carries inherent limitations. Firstly, articles were tagged with research themes based on abstract review alone and may therefore have been incomplete or subject to misclassification. We suspect this form of classification bias was small in magnitude and without directionality, as abstracts were reviewed by committee. Importantly, the literature search likely did not capture all output in the Russian Federation or countries of the former Soviet Union. The MeSH term “Soviet Union” was an umbrella term for seven of the 15 countries (Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Ukraine and Uzbekistan). Countries that were not included in the umbrella were Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Belarus. Thus, while many articles regarding the eight countries not included within the umbrella term were still captured because “Soviet Union” was found in the title or abstract, this may partly explain the observed frequency of articles from Ukraine. Output that was not published in publicly available sources, as is common for doctoral theses, “gray” literature, or working reports, or even that which was published in smaller journals that were not indexed in the major databases we utilized would also be missed. While the majority of research from countries of the former Soviet Union will at least have been referenced in English, if research was exclusively referenced in a database that was not English or Russian language, it may not have been included. Accessing research that was not in databases would have required extensive onsite participation and authorization from local universities, ministries of health and other repositories that would have been beyond the scope of this review and would have been subject to retrieval biases. Additionally, the comparison of research output relative to the Russian Federation regional HIV prevalence was dependent upon regional reports that did not account for deaths among people living with HIV or comparative proportions tested negative for HIV. True prevalence or incidence could not accurately be recorded. A small number of articles may have been represented as multiple data points in the analysis because of links to multiple countries or cities within the Russian Federation. Lastly, given the number and diversity of countries within the former Soviet states and the potential underrepresentation of individual countries throughout the study period given our search strategy, the bulk of secondary analyses and policy related discussion was restricted to the Russian Federation.</p>
