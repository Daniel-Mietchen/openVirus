<p>The Russian government's State Strategy goals include the development of new technologies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HIV with scientifically informed responses (

Considering the staggering number of TB infections in the Russian Federation with increasing numbers of MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant-TB (XDR-TB), indicating resistance to nearly all classes of TB therapy, there was a lower than expected proportion of articles with TB as a research theme (only 10.8% of Russian articles). There was no significant increase in TB themed research over time when compared to countries of the former Soviet Union. TB prevalence also varies among Russian federal districts and is 1.6 times more common in Siberia, and increasingly so among the population of PWID (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Importantly, we observed the most notable mismatches between scientific output and population adjusted estimates of HIV prevalence in the Siberian and neighboring Ural and Volga regions. Mirroring the separation of HIV and TB research in the Russian Federation, present Russian health care infrastructure favors the division of TB and HIV services. For example, TB physicians cannot directly prescribe antiretroviral therapy. It must be approved by committee and distributed through centralized HIV treatment facilities (
