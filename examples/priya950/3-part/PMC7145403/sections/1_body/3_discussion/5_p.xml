<p>Two other major high risk populations for HIV acquisition and transmission are MSM and sex workers. There was a statistically significant difference in total number of publications addressing sex workers between the Russian Federation and countries of the former Soviet Union (4.8 vs. 9.3%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = &lt;0·001) with a similar pattern for MSM (4.9 vs. 7.3%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). Limited epidemiologic data in the Russian Federation estimated rates of HIV acquisition due to MSM to be 4–6%, but a recent respondent driven sampling study in Moscow showed that of MSM tested for HIV there was a prevalence of &gt;15% (

The majority of MSM related publications originated from the Central and Northwest districts (78%). While these districts are the most populated regions in the Russian Federation, the small number of publications in the remainder of the Federation is noteworthy.
