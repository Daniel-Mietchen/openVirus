<p>Our systematic geospatial review of HIV/AIDS related research in Eastern Europe/Central Asia and the Russian Federation revealed fewer than expected publications over a 25 year period by formal bibliometric analysis. Of the articles from the Russian Federation, there were 15 publications per million population, which is lower than what has been seen in other comparable bibliometric studies (

Compared to the Russian Federation with its population of nearly 144 million, a bibliometric analysis of HIV/AIDS research in Lesotho, a country of &lt;2 million people, there were nearly 1,280 articles published over the same time period (640 publications per million). A similar analysis of 27 European countries with currently much more limited HIV epidemics from 2002 to 2011 indexed a total of 90,564 articles with a median publication rate of 45 per million population (

When evaluating specific research themes within the Russian Federation, there were even smaller numbers of publications addressing some of the largest issues pertinent to the HIV epidemic such as injection drug use, imprisonment, or the syndemics of HCV and TB.
