Of the 15 countries of the former Soviet Union, only the Russian Federation legally prohibits opioid substitution therapy and apart from Turkmenistan it is available in every other former Soviet country. Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Moldova and Armenia also offer needle-syringe programs and opioid substitution therapy in prisons (
