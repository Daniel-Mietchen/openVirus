<p>Given thematic analyses and corresponding to the priorities within the Russian Federation's state strategy to combat HIV and comorbidities, we evaluated trends in TB and HCV research themes over time. The percentage of articles per year related to both TB and HCV as a proportion of the total number of articles trended up in both the Russian Federation and countries of the former Soviet Union, yet this increase was significantly greater for countries of the former Soviet Union when compared to the Russian Federation (
