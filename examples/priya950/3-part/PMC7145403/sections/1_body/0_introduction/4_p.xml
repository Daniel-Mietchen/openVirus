<p>Given the immense HIV epidemic in the region of the Russian Federation and countries of the former Soviet Union, a robust research response would be expected. The first bibliometric analysis of AIDS was published in 1992, and captured the scientific literature that presented HIV as the causative infection of AIDS (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Since that time, several bibliometric analyses have been completed to evaluate HIV/AIDS research in specific regions of the world (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), none have analyzed HIV/AIDS literature specifically in the Russian Federation. In order to better understand how the HIV epidemic in this region has been assessed and measured, we aimed to capture publicly available scientific literature pertaining to HIV/AIDS in the Russian Federation and countries of the former Soviet Union in both English and Russian language databases. Understanding the limitations of causative assumptions from this bibliometric work, we further developed an interactive web-map that could be used by researchers and policy makers to guide future interventions and allow for additional evaluation of research output.
