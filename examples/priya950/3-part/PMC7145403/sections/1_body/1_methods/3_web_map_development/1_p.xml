<p>Data was translated into an interactive web application using ArcGIS
 <sup>Â®</sup>. Within the application there are three main maps. Map one displays the quantity of research articles from the Russian Federation over the geographic region from which the data or research topic originated. Map two displays the quantity of published studies based on the location of the primary researcher, or first author, highlighting potential research partnerships across the world. Map three and four are time-lapse maps of Map one and two respectively, that visually depict the progression of research from 1991 to 2016. Map one and two have a filter function that allows for interactive visualization as users adjust date ranges and narrow the map results by research themes or location. Additionally, article details are displayed below maps with hyperlinks to full article texts if available on public domains. Tables presenting analyzed data are also displayed below the first two maps. This web application is available to the public: [
