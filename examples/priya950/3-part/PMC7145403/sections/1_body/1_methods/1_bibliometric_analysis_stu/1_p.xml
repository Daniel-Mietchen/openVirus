<p>Four major English-based scientific databases: PubMed
 <sup>®</sup>, Web of Science
 <sup>®</sup>, Embase (Elsevier), and eLibrary
 <sup>®</sup>, and two additional Russian databases: Central Scientific Medical Library, and Moscow State Medical University Library were searched using the medical subject heading terms “HIV” or “AIDS” AND “Russia” or “Soviet Union”- a term that links to other country-specific headings. The search was limited to articles electronically published after December 31, 1990 to coincide with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the HIV epidemic in the region, and before January 1, 2017 to assure to account for delayed postings of publications in the final year of review. Articles in English or Russian were included if HIV/AIDS, Russian Federation and/or former Soviet Union were contained within the title or abstract text, or if any author locations were in the Russian Federation or countries of the former Soviet Union. News articles, editorials, commentaries, and those that did not fit the search criteria were excluded.
