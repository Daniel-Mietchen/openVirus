 <sup>+</sup> MÎ¦s, as the first cell types being infected during blood-borne infections, are crucial gatekeepers [

 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, we highlighted the distinct role of 
 <italic>Usp18</italic> in CD169
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages during natural infection and its potential role during vaccination. UBP43 is a multifunctional molecule involved in several processes. Beside its protease activity which controls cell metabolism, the turnover of transport proteins or the activation of transcription, 
 <italic>Usp18</italic> is essential for cell development [
 <xref rid="B38-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Absence of 
 <italic>Usp18</italic> impaired the generation of CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, as well as Th17 cells [
 <xref rid="B39-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Former mouse models investigated enforced virus replication in the ubiquitous absence of 
 <italic>Usp18</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Due to its previously mentioned features, studies could not clarify if enforced replication solely relies on 
 <italic>Usp18</italic> expression in CD169
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages or is influenced by other cell types. For the first time, we were able to generate a model with CD169-specific knockout of 
 <italic>Usp18</italic>. We found that the early replication of VSV is restricted to CD169
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages and is strongly enhanced in the presence of 
 <italic>Usp18</italic>. A strong activation of innate as well as adaptive immune responses is the result, which is essential to circumvent lethal infection.
