 <sup>fl/fl</sup> littermate controls. All animals were housed in single ventilated cages. Animal experiments were authorized by the Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz (LANUV) Nordrhein-Westfalen (Düsseldorf, Germany) and in accordance with the German law for animal protection and/or according to institutional guidelines at the Ontario Cancer Institute of the University Health Network. For survival experiments, animals were infected with a dose that was sublethal for WT animals. Animals were checked daily, killed with corresponding termination criteria, and counted as dead. Termination criteria were body weight, general condition, spontaneous behavior and clinical findings.
