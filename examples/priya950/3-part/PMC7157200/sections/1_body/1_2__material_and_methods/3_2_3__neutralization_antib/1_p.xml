<p>VSV neutralization assay was performed as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, neutralization assay samples were prediluted 1:40 (VSV) or 1:10 (VSV-EBOV). After complement inactivation at 56 °C for 30 min, serum was diluted 1:2 for 12 steps and incubated with 1 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU of VSV or VSV-EBOV for 90 min to obtain total Ig neutralization (VSV and VSV-EBOV). To analyze IgG neutralization, samples were preincubated with β-mercaptoethanol (0.1 M) to remove IgM before virus incubation (VSV). Samples were transferred to Vero E6 cells and overlaid with methylcellulose. of incubation, plaques were visualized via crystal violet staining.
