<p>In addition, a generation of LASV sequences at the local scale during outbreaks within specific countries such as Nigeria and Sierra Leone contributes to the molecular epidemiology of the virus [

Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences, dominated by clinical samples from humans, commonly depict independent chains of transmission in humans originating from rodents. However, an increasing number of rodent-derived sequences from ecological studies targeted at endemic localities where humans have been regularly sequenced now provide the opportunity to further examine primary LASV transmission [
