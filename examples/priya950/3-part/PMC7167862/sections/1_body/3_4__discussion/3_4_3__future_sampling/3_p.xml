<p>Thus, future studies should aim to link human and rodent data more directly at a finer scale (i.e., at the level of the home address), producing multiple, comparable phylogenetic reconstructions of who-infected-who within a locality. This will help to further support our findings and will provide much needed insight underlying LASV transmission mechanisms at the rodentâ€“human interface.</p>
