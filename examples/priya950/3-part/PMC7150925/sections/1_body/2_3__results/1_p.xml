<p>Captured African buffalo and Uganda kob did not have clinical signs, but antibodies against PPRV were detected in 2015 and 2017 in most of the areas sampled from QENP, with the exception of Keymale in the most southern part of the Ishasha sector and Mweya peninsula (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00293-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The overall prevalence of PPRV antibodies in buffalo was 19.0% (CI 95%, 10.9–30.8) including both years and 10.3% (CI 95%, 4.1–23.6) for Uganda kob, with an overall sample prevalence in Ugandan wildlife of 15.5% (CI 95%, 9.6–24.0) (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00293-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). No statistical differences of seroprevalence in both individuals and herds were detected between years. Within herd antibody prevalence ranged from 25.0% to 66.7% in kob (

 <italic>n</italic> = 8 herds); this was calculated only in herds with positive animals and with a minimum of three individuals sampled.
