<p>PPR was clinically reported during the study period in small livestock from Uganda in Kasese district (spring; 2016), Kabale and Kisoro districts (Juneâ€“August; 2017), and North Kivu (October; 2017) in DRC (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00293">Figure S1</xref>). From the outbreak in North Kivu, 12 nasal swab samples out of 14 tested were found positive in RT-qPCR assay with cycle-threshold values (C
 <sub>T</sub>-values) ranging from 18 to 34 (

 <sub>T</sub>-values were subjected to RT-PCR to amplify the C-terminal region of the N-gene. The purified amplicon was sequenced on both strands, and a total of two partial N-gene sequences were generated in this study. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the total of 35 partial N-gene sequences (
