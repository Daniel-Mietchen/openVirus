<p>Sero-epidemiological data from western Uganda indicate similar temporal patterns of PPRV exposure in wildlife and livestock. The first evidence of PPRV infection in wildlife in the area, but without clinical disease, was reported in African buffalo from 2004–2005 (

In this study, we further confirm PPRV antibodies in wildlife from QENP in 2015 with seropositive &lt;1-year-old buffalo and kobs, and subsequent positive livestock in communities around QENP in 2016. The local rise of seroprevalence detected in livestock from 2016 is consistent with a previous study [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00293">Table S1</xref>). These results suggest that wildlife from QENP was widely exposed to PPRV before the first epizootic spread in most of the local livestock, but with a tight temporal pattern. Previous studies in Tanzania also found a linkage between PPRV antibodies in wildlife and epidemic cycles in domestic sheep and goats, suggesting that spillover may easily occur at the wildlife–livestock interface in the African context [
