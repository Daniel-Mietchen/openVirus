<p>Cattle are more frequent visitors to QENP and more likely to share resources and contact with wildlife [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Sheep and goats typically dwell nearby human settlements and rarely enter protected areas. It is noteworthy that the prevalence of anti-PPRV antibodies in livestock around QENP is consistent with a recent study based on the same Ugandan districts, and that a higher seroprevalence in cattle as compared to sheep and goats was also found [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In northern Tanzania, cattle from villages where PPR occurred among small ruminants also showed high seropositivity [

 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and this is supported by field data in this study and previous ones [

 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, the competence of cattle to transmit PPRV to other susceptible hosts is poorly explored, especially considering that breeds in livestock may introduce variability in PPR expression and epidemiology [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Cattle may be a good sentinel for PPRV circulation at the wildlifeâ€“livestock interface given that the infection does not cause fatalities and they are more commonly in contact with wildlife.
