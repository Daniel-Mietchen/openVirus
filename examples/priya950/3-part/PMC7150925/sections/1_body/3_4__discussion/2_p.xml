<p>PPRV lineage II, III, and IV have circulated in different countries and regions from East Africa [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], reports the circulation of PPRV lineage III in the northern Albertine Rift area causing the first-known PPR outbreaks in this region from 2016 onwards. Our results confirm that PPRV strains from DRC in October 2017 were identical to the lineage III strains that emerged subsequently in Burundi in December 2017 [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This transboundary spread is most likely triggered by formal and/or informal movements of small ruminants. However, the role of wildlife in spreading and maintaining PPR or bridging distant livestock populations cannot be ruled out as transboundary protected areas occur between all states in this region (

These findings align with recent observations in the Karamoja region in northeastern Uganda; despite being large pastoral systems, separate foci for transmission and PPRV maintenance were identified within relatively small but probably transboundary areas [
