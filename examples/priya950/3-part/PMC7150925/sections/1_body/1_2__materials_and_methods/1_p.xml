<p>This purposive epidemiological study was designed to detect the presence of disease through observation and/or detection of infection by serology in sampled African buffalo and Uganda kob (
 <italic>Kobus kob thomasi</italic>) in Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP). Other opportunistic sampling, for other purposes, in western Uganda from livestock in communities around QENP, wildlife from South Sudan, and suspected PPR infected flocks of small domestic ruminants in DRC, provided context for the wildlife serological results in the region.
