<p>Clinical signs of PPR are associated to the lymphotropic and epitheliotropic nature of the virus and comprise of depression, conjunctivitis, ocular and nasal discharge, erosions/ulcers of the oral mucosa, respiratory distress, and diarrhea and may eventually lead to death [

However, both clinical signs and mortality can vary widely depending on viral strains, breeds, coinfections, and general nutrition and fitness. During the last decade, PPR experienced a dramatic geographic expansion to East Asia and re-emerged in endemic areas [

Following previous successful experiences with Rinderpest (RP) eradication, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) launched an eradication program for PPR that aims to control and eradicate the disease by 2030 [
