<p>The impact that PPR can have in wild animal populations is exemplified by the massive die-offs reported in wildlife from Mongolia [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and mountain ungulates from the Middle East, and south and east of Asia [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. African wildlife appears to also be commonly exposed to PPRV according to antibody and virus detection, but as of yet, there is little evidence of the disease in free-ranging populations [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The only recent credible report of PPR disease in free-ranging African wildlife was in a population of dorcas gazelles (
 <italic>Gazella dorcas</italic>) in Dinder National Park in Sudan in 2017, but epidemiological and pathological information are lacking in these reports [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A broad wild-domestic interface exists around unfenced natural areas and effective contacts for pathogen transmission increasingly occur between livestock and wildlife [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In fact, PPRV spillover from a domestic source was suggested in the Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania with higher antibody prevalence in wildlife close to livestock, but without evident clinical syndromes or mortality [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although it is becoming clearer as to the role of wildlife in PPR epidemiology, with most data supporting the hypothesis of wildlife as a victim rather than reservoir [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], there are still gaps in understanding. The circulation of PPRV among wildlife even on a temporary basis can contribute to the virus persistence in multi-host systems and enhance the spread of the virus [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Whether PPRV can be maintained in natural systems or at the wildlifeâ€“livestock interface is not known, but the high host plasticity exhibited by the virus poses a challenge for PPR control and eradication programs, as well as a continuous threat of disease outbreaks in vulnerable African wildlife.
