  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Diagram of flavivirus life cycle with emphasis on distribution of viral capsid (red). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Schematic of the flaviviral genome, polyprotein, and transmembrane viral proteins. Adapted from Ming et al. [
   <xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Red boxes indicate soluble viral proteins in the cytoplasm. The primary focus of this review will be the viral capsid [C] protein. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Diagram of flavivirus particle with E (yellow), M (orange), and C (red) proteins. E and M proteins span the membrane derived from host endoplasmic reticulum and capsid interacts with these proteins as well as coats the viral genome (blue line).
