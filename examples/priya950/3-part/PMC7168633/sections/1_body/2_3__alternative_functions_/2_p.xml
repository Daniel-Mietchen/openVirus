<p>What is currently known of some of these alternative functions is that they can be either pro- or anti-viral. The presence of ZIKV C in nucleoli has been associated with ribosomal stress and an increase in programed cell death, especially in neuro-progenitor cells [

 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The localization of capsid in the nucleolus is not specific to ZIKV as it has been shown for DENV, WNV, and JEV as well [
 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A closer look into the effects of JEV C and DENV C in the nucleolus indicated interactions with ribosome biogenesis factors such as B23 and NPM1 or nucleolin, respectively [
 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. WNV capsid appears to sequester p53 inhibitor MDM2/HDM2 in the nucleolus, allowing p53 to mediate apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Mitochondrial membrane disruption may be due to p53-dependent up-regulation of Bax [

 <xref rid="B55-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], ultimately resulting in the cleavage of pro-caspase 9 and apoptosis as well as local inflammation

However, it has also been shown that YFV C has the ability to suppress the anti-viral RNA silencing process in mosquitos by protecting viral dsRNA from processing via dicer [
 <xref rid="B48-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This serves to allow propagation of the virus, however this method of vector immune response evasion does not appear to apply to all mosquito-borne flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="B57-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Host protein Jab1 has also been shown to aid in the removal of WNV C from the nucleolus and present the viral protein to the proteasome for degradation, effectively preventing apoptosis in human lung carcinoma cell lines such as H1299 [
 <xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. WNV C has also been shown to up-regulate protein phosphatase 2A, preventing the downstream upregulation of type I interferon genes [
 <xref rid="B55-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Clearly, there are many interactions that capsid makes within cells that can either serve to aid or attenuate viral infection. We have only begun to scratch the surface of what these interactions are and how they affect host cells.
