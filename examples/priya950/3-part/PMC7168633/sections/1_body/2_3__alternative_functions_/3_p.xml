<p>It has also been noted that flavivirus infection results in massive changes to the host/vector transcriptomes [

 <xref rid="B39-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This may be the result of regulation of transcription, alternative splicing, or decay of transcripts. In the case of DENV serotype 1 in Huh7 cells, the largest changes observed were in differential isoforms, indicating alternative splicing [

 <xref rid="B39-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Generally, studies have focused on changes in the transcriptome in response to viral infection, but it may be interesting to see if introduction to individual viral proteins result in their own signatures.
