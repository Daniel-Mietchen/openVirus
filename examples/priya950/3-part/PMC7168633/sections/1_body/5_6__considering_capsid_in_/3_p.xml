<p>Luckily, reverse genetics lets us decipher what effect different mutations and deletions have on different viral processes. For example, it is now known that mutations in the 3â€² UTR result in hinder flaviviral replication [
 <xref rid="B84-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Unsurprisingly, many mutations to the gene encoding capsid protein result in the production of sub-viral particles (SVPs,

 <xref rid="B85-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. These SVPs are immunogenic as they display the viral surface proteins E and M, but non-infectious because they fail to package the viral genome. Thus, they have the potential be used as vaccines. The first flavivirus this was observed in was tick-borne encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="B85-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Since then we have seen the production of these attenuated viral genomes for many flaviviruses, including WNV, ZIKV and DENV [
 <xref rid="B86-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="B87-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. These are initially produced in cells expressing wild-type/full-length capsid and the virions produced can be used for immunization. In mice, such vaccines have been shown to confer immunity with as little as one dose and protect fetuses of pregnant females [
 <xref rid="B86-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. To date, there has not been a strong push for capsid mutant live-attenuated vaccines in clinical trials, although their efficacy in animal models seems promising.
