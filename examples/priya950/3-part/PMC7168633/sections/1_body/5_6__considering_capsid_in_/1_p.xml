<p>Considering the potential symptoms of hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis or even death and the geographic expansion of mosquito vectors, established and emerging flaviviruses are an increasing public health risk globally [

 <xref rid="B74-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. There is a clear need for safer and more efficacious flavivirus vaccines. One success story is that of the veterinary vaccine, RecombiTEK (Merial) available since 2004, used to vaccinate horses against West Nile virus. This recombinant virus uses canarypox as a vector to express WNV E and prM proteins. Interestingly there are multiple equine WNV vaccines commercially available: RecombiTEK, a live-attenuated vaccine, and a chimeric vaccine containing the 17D backbone but expressing WNV E and prM [
 <xref rid="B75-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. All of these allow the survival of all horses challenged with WNV infection, compared to the devastating ~30% fatality rate seen during the breakout in the United States in 1999 [
 <xref rid="B76-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. There are currently only a few flavivirus vaccines commercially available to humans. The two most notable are the live-attenuated YFV 17D vaccine and 
 <italic>Dengvaxia</italic> (a tetravalent DENV chimeric vaccine), but there are also vaccines available for JEV [

 <xref rid="B78-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Although the 17D vaccine was generated in the 1930s, it is still widely used to immunize people today as it is one of the safest and most effective vaccines available. With six countries producing three strains of this live-attenuated vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) Fhas set a course to eliminate yellow fever epidemics over the course of a decade [
 <xref rid="B79-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Although this vaccine is widely used, it does however have a its share of adverse effects [
 <xref rid="B80-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Mild symptoms are seen in 25% of immunized individuals and 1 in 55,000 experience a severe allergic reaction. Symptoms can extend to severe nervous system (1 in 125,000) or even extensive organ failure (1 in 250,000) with over half of those entering organ failure passing away [
 <xref rid="B81-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Even with these statistics, the effective use of 17D as vaccine garners hope for the development of other flavivirus vaccines. The chimeric vaccine available for DENV, 
 <italic>Dengvaxia,</italic> uses 17D as a template or backbone but substitutes the genes for the E and prM proteins from the different DENV serotypes. It is a tetravalent vaccine, but has only been shown to confer immunity for two of the four serotypes of DENV. Studies have shown that administration of this vaccine resulted in multiple cases of serious injury to children in the Philippines [

As mutating or deleting capsid hinders the production of infectious particles, a more serious look at how capsid is involved in packaging and how we can use that information to develop better vaccines is warranted. Here, we will focus on how capsid can be taken into consideration for vaccine design and development, particularly in live-attenuated, DNA, and subunit vaccines.
