<p>One potential issue with the use of these DNA vaccines, or even capsid mutant live attenuated vaccines, is the amount of SVPs that would need to be produced to confer immunity, and of course there is also the concern for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE occurs when antibodies circulating from a previous infection bind new antigen without neutralizing virus, resulting in a more efficient uptake into monocytes. This is common across the dengue serotypes and extends to Zika virus as well [

 <xref rid="B96-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Therefore, there may also be promise in a subunit vaccine containing a viral antigen, such as soluble capsid protein. This has been observed in immunization of ducks for Duck Tembusu virus, a new member of the

 <xref rid="B97-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Although the capsid protein is not exposed on the surface of flaviviral particles, the protein may elicit both an adaptive and innate immune response. This is interesting because we typically consider responses to the surface proteins E and M. It seems plausible that flavivirus infected cells may lyse, releasing capsid or even present fragments of capsid via the up-regulated MHC I pathwayâ€”resulting in these same responses in infected individuals [

 <xref rid="B101-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Without crucial studies looking at the effectiveness of such a vaccine and its safety in humans we cannot comment further, but this may be an interesting path worth investigating.
