<p>Traditionally, live attenuated viruses were generated by serial passaging of virus in cell culture or animal tissue until virulence greatly decreased [

 <xref rid="B82-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The YFV vaccine noted above, 17D, was generated roughly 80 years ago via serial passaging of the wild-type Asibi strain 176 times in mouse and chicken tissues [

 <xref rid="B82-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The primary method of attenuation in 17D is its reduced genetic diversity within the YFV quasi-species, indicating high fidelity caused by mutations within nonstructural genes [
 <xref rid="B82-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Interestingly, the majority of mutations present in 17D are silent, in that they code for the same amino acid. Therefore, it is possible that codon de-optimization aids in attenuation. However, E2992G in the NS5 (RdRP and methyl-transferase) may provide the increased fidelity of the polymerase [
 <xref rid="B83-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] and mutations in the envelope protein may also hinder receptor binding or membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="B77-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. This vaccine has many substitutions throughout the genome, primarily in non-structural genes. Interestingly however, F49G in the capsid is generally overlooked. This is the only mutation in the capsid gene [
 <xref rid="B83-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], indicating that perhaps capsid must be conserved to package the genome, allowing multiple rounds of infection. The substitution of a bulky side chain for a single hydrogen may impact interactions with lipid membranes and could be worth exploring.
