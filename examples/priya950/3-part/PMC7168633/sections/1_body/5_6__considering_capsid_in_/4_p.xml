<p>Additionally, a number of flavivirus DNA vaccines have entered clinical trials, but they primarily focus on the expression of envelope and membrane proteins to produce SVPs, or recombinant viruses [

 <xref rid="B90-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,

 <xref rid="B92-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Similar to the live-attenuated vaccines above, a DNA vaccine with mutations in capsid protein would produce SVPs. One concern is that it may require a lot of DNA to immunize even a single person. This highlights the potential for single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) in flavivirus vaccine development [

 <xref rid="B93-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. SRIPs are DNA vaccines that are comprised of a plasmid encoding for the viral genome lacking the capsid and with capsid provide via trans-expression. These allow for the production of authentic infectious particles within the first infected cell, but packaging viral genomes that are defective, as they lack the capsid gene. These defective particles are used as the vaccine, resulting in the production of immunogenic SVPs in the immunized individual (

 <xref rid="B94-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. These vaccines are particularly promising as the majority of particles produced would be non-infectious but should elicit an immune response sufficient for immunity.
