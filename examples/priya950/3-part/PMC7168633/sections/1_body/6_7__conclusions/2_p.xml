<p>The current understanding of flavivirus capsid and its role in the virus life cycle is based on information from the capsid structures [

 <xref rid="B42-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], information about nucleocapsid assembly [

 <xref rid="B104-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], and the protein’s interactions with host proteins with hopes of potential discovery of drug targets [

 <xref rid="B61-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,

 <xref rid="B72-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Upon cleavage from the viral polyprotein by signal peptidase, capsid can interact with vesicular transport proteins to move towards storage on lipid droplets or towards the nucleus [
 <xref rid="B61-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Capsid dimers interact with the membrane of lipid droplets, aiding in both viral packaging and storage of capsid prior to packaging [
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We speculate that there may be an equilibrium between capsid dimers stored on lipid droplets for particle formation and capsid dimers able or available to enter the host nucleus and nucleolus. It has been shown that flavivirus infections can alter the host transcriptome including up-regulation of lipid synthesis [
 <xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Perhaps the equilibrium noted above could be influenced by the number and size of available lipid droplets within a host cell, i.e., a cell’s capsid storage capacity. Flavivirus capsid apparently binds nucleic acids non-specifically [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] but capsid is not the only soluble viral protein with the ability to bind double stranded nucleic acids [
 <xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Many transcriptome studies have been done in the context of these viral infections, however it is unclear if capsid or other soluble viral proteins, such as NS5 which has been shown to enter the host nucleus, are responsible for transcriptome-wide changes. Studies on transcriptome changes in response to the soluble viral proteins individually may shed light on specific changes in the host transcriptome. In addition, although various host proteins have been found interacting with the capsid protein [
 <xref rid="B61-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] only a few of these interactions have been thoroughly studied and although some drugs have been designed to target these interactions there is still no treatment for these infections.
