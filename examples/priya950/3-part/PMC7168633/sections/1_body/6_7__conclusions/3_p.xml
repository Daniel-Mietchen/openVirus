<p>In the future we expect to see more studies investigating the implications of the various interactions and considering how disrupting they are, which may prove helpful in the design of novel antiviral treatments. Particular consideration should be taken to review all pathways that could potentially be affected by capsid interactions based on the currently identified protein interactions. In addition, interactions resulting in clear pro- or anti-viral processes are prime targets for anti-viral design. It is also pertinent to garner better understanding of how capsid interacts with viral genome and other nucleic acids in host cells. With immunoprecipitation pull down of nucleic acids bound to capsid and next generation sequencing it may be possible to elucidate binding patterns, whether they are motifs or RNA structural features. Overall, there is much to be desired in terms of the fieldâ€™s knowledge pertaining to what specific interactions flavivirus capsid proteins make within cells and how those interactions are relevant in both pathogenesis and drug or design.</p>
