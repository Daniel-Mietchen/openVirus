<p>Capsid proteins are the least genetically conserved of flavivirus proteins, but their structure and charge distribution are well conserved. Flavivirus capsids are highly charged proteins that contain multiple α-helical domains [
 <xref rid="B44-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In its immature state, flavivirus capsid has a hydrophobic C-terminal domain (known as anchorC) that embeds in the ER membrane and is cleaved by NS3/2B protease releasing a soluble mature capsid, 99 to 114 residues in size [
 <xref rid="B45-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Soluble capsid proteins readily dimerize 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, as confirmed by crosslinking studies [
 <xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Visualization of the dimers, although limited, has been found in asymmetric reconstructions of cryo-EM data, indicating that the dimer likely reflects the physiological conformation and is not an artifact of crystallization conditions. Initially, the three-dimensional structures of DENV and WNV capsid were solved using NMR and crystallography respectively [

 <xref rid="B46-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. At present, residues ~20–98 of many flavivirus capsids have been resolved in crystal structures (

 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Each monomer is comprised of three to four alpha-helices, the first being the most flexible, consistently forming a right-handed bundle with the second helix (and third if there are four in total). Within dimers, these helices interact via hydrophobic interactions as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00042-f002">Figure 2</xref>. As depicted, the top (α1-α1′), bottom (α4-α4′), and core (α2-α2′) helices interact via hydrophobic interactions [
 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In contrast, the first ~20 residues are intrinsically disordered in solution and, similar to the final helix which extends away from the monomer core, are highly basic [

 <xref rid="B45-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In contrast, the regions connecting α1-α2 and α1′-α2′ are relatively hydrophobic, allowing interactions with lipid bilayers [
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In reference to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00042-f002">Figure 2</xref>, where this hydrophobic linker-region is labeled by a cyan circle, the charge distribution places the basic residues on the “bottom” of the dimer, leaving the “top” of the dimer relatively uncharged.
