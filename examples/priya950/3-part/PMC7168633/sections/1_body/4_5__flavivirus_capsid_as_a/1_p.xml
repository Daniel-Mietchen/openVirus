<p>Although in theory any viral protein may serve as an antiviral target, flavivirus capsid has many structural features and functions that can steer antiviral drug design. Previously, the E, NS3, NS5, and NS4B flaviviral proteins have served as targets, but therapeutic candidates have fallen short due to undesirable pharmacokinetics, poor selectivity, permeability or stability [

 <xref rid="B67-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], they may serve as a valuable target in the case of flaviviruses. Capsid has no enzymatic core, therefore anti-viral strategies would focus on disrupting capsid interactions with other host or viral factors. There are three important interactions of interest: capsid-protein interactions (homo-dimer formation, formation of the nucleocapsid, or interactions with host proteins), capsid-RNA interactions, and capsid-phospholipid membrane interactions.
