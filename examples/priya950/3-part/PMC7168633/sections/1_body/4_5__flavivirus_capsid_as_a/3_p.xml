<p>Little work has been done to provide greater understanding of how nucleic acids, in particular how RNA species, may compete for capsid binding. Although we have seen flavivirus capsid’s ability to essentially bind any nucleic acid, it is not clear if capsid has a preference for binding RNA motifs or secondary structures. Recently, Boon et al. showed that capsid’s interactions with viral genome indicate some preference for G-quadruplexes

 <xref rid="B71-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It has also been shown that capsid proteins have the ability to anneal RNAs, indicating the ability to interact with both ss- and dsRNA [
 <xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], in contrast to predictions that capsid would specifically bind single-stranded RNA [
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, it is entirely possible that capsid binds both ss- and dsRNA in the process of compacting the genome. Therefore, a comparison of what nucleic acids capsid binds 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> is necessary. Understanding how nucleic acids interact with capsid is necessary to determine if an RNA oligo could be used to compete with the viral genome for capsid binding. It may be possible that an aptamer may also prevent capsid’s interactions with host proteins as indicated above.
