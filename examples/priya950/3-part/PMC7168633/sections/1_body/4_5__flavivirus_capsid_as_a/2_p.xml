<p>Capsid self-interactions, such as dimerization and nucleocapsid formation, aid in the packaging of the viral genome. Hindering these processes would result in viral attenuation. Conversely, stabilizing capsid dimers may prevent genome release upon cell entry. One example is the small molecule inhibitor of DENV C, ST-148 [

 <xref rid="B69-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. This small molecule binds in the hydrophobic pocket between two capsid dimers, stabilizing this interaction. This has been shown to reduce the number of virus particles produced/released as well as prevent genome release [

 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00042-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). DENV capsid binds nucleolin, as noted previously, disrupting ribosome biogenesis. siRNA treatment with aptamer AS1411 prevents nucleolinâ€™s interaction with capsid proteins by directly binding to nucleolin precluding capsid interaction [
 <xref rid="B56-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Therefore, targeting host factors rather than viral proteins is an attractive strategy to avoid virus adaption and the evolution of drug resistance. Although aptamers designed to bind capsid may prevent a number of its various interactions.
