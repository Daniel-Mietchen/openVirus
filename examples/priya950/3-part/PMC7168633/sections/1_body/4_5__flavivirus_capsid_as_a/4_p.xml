<p>Many have already begun looking into the use of small molecules or peptides to prevent the association of flavivirus capsids with membranes [
 <xref rid="B54-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NGDA) is a small molecule that reduces the amount of lipids in the cell by causing an increase in certain effector molecules. NGDA prevents lipogenesis via its impact on the effector AMPK-α and increases fatty acid oxidation through PPAR-α [

 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although these small molecules do not bind capsid protein, they effectively serve as antivirals as capsid can no longer associate with membranes that are not present. Inhibitors of cholesterol transporters such as ABCG1 have also shown promise as effective flavivirus antivirals [
 <xref rid="B39-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In 2012, Martins et al. investigated DENV capsid interactions to lipid droplets by producing peptides mimicking the N-terminal domain of the capsid. In further testing they discovered that treatment with one of these peptides, pep14-23, not only bound lipid droplets but prevented full length capsid from interacting with the membrane [
