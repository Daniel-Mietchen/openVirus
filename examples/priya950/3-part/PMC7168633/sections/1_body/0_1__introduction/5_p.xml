<p>Capsid is a small ~12-kDa protein comprising the first ~105 residues of the flavivirus polyprotein. Capsid proteins both have a hydrophobic face that interacts with ER membrane as well as a basic face that interacts with viral RNA. Binding of RNA to capsid initiates particle formation by causing an aggregation of capsid. The aggregation of membrane-associated capsid into the nucleocapsid structure induces budding into the ER and the formation of immature virus particles. Capsid protein has been shown to bind multiple nucleic acid templates in a sequence-independent manner via electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged phosphate backbone [

 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The coupling of replication and packaging within these ER membrane compartments prevents capsid from packaging host RNAs. Until recently, it was unclear how capsid within these replication factories interacts specifically with the (+) sense viral genome, as there is some amount of (−) sense template available within these compartments. It was proposed that the (−) sense associated with nascent (+) sense intermediate prevents capsid binding [

Recent studies demonstrating NS2A binding to 3′ UTR of genomic RNA and the subsequent localization to membrane-bound assembly factories suggest that this viral protein may nucleate or ‘seed’ the loading of capsid, thus providing the specificity in packaging of just the genomic RNA [
