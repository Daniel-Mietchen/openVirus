<p>It has also been shown that capsid proteins co-localize with the nucleoli and lipid droplets within infected cells [

 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The capsid proteinâ€™s ability to leave the replication factories is interesting, and coupled with their ability to bind various nucleic acids (and host proteins) [

 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], suggests that flavivirus capsid may have multiple evolved functions beyond viral packaging. The result of these interactions can result in either the activation or repression of various pathways with deleterious effects, including apoptosis or cell cycle arrest [

 <xref rid="B37-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, host transcriptome-wide profiles have been generated for various flaviviral infections in different cell types, indicating broad gene-level changes [

 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As capsid is one of the few viral proteins released from the ER membrane and has been shown to leave the replication compartments and enter the nucleus, it is reasonable to consider that it may be at least partially responsible for changes to the host transcriptome. However, the specific protein or nucleic acid interactions and which pathways they affect that may result in these changes are not well understood.
