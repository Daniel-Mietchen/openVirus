<p>Painful bites can lead to loss of blood and discomfort, which may result in lower productivity of bitten livestock. These flies tend to accumulate in places where animals remain for relatively long periods. It has been observed that the number of flies decreases as the distance from these places increases. This suggests that the distribution of the 
 <italic>S. calcitrans</italic> population is significantly affected by the distribution of livestock (
