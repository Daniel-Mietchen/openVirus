<p>ASF is a serious socio-economic problem. Goods are imported and exported on a massive scale, creating the risk of introducing potential viral vectors along with the transported goods to areas where they have not previously been present. In the case of ticks from the 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> genus, this can lead to the virus becoming established in the environment for a long period. In addition, the results of experimental studies carried out so far seem to confirm the possibility of transmission of ASFV by 
 <italic>S. calcitrans</italic>, therefore studies of insects near farms are extremely important. Considering the biology of 
 <italic>Stomoxys</italic> flies, it seems that they may be involved in ASF transmission over short distances (for example, within a farm). A significant threat in terms of virus transmission may be in the sanguivorous flies of the 
 <italic>Tabanidae</italic> family, because they are larger than 
 <italic>S. calcitrans</italic> and can fly over long distances. These flies can be mechanical vectors for many viral pathogens (
 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0001_ref_002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Unlike 
 <italic>S. calcitrans</italic>, these flies do not breed on farms where animals are kept and therefore can have easier contact with wild boars living in the forests. In addition, these flies consume up to five times as much blood during feeding. This leads to a larger infectious dose per fly. When considering the infectious dose required for an animal to develop the disease, the animal’s health should be considered – weak or diseased animals will be more susceptible to infection than healthy animals due to a weaker immune system response. Therefore, the dose for the weakened animal will be lower than for a healthy animal. The development of full-blown disease in such an animal will result in further transmission between animals living on the same farm. Their greater size and the environment in which they can live and reproduce gives flies from the 
 <italic>Tabanidae</italic> family an important role in virus transmission as well as 
 <italic>Musca domestica</italic>, 
 <italic>Calliphora vomitoria</italic>, 
 <italic>Lucilia sericata</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. calcitrans</italic> flies and 
 <italic>Ixodidae</italic> family and 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> genus ticks. The transmission of ASFV by insects is an additional biosecurity challenge for farms producing and breeding pigs. Research into the identification of new potential ASFV vectors is extremely important, because the discovery of new biological and mechanical vectors will allow a more accurate understanding of the virus transmission pathways, more effective disease control, stronger protection of pig holdings, and greater reduction of disease spread.
