<p>An extremely important aspect in preventing further infection with ASFV is knowledge and awareness of the survival of the virus in the environment and in food. ASFV is characterised by high resistance to environmental factors. The virus is also very resistant to pH changes and is stable between points 4 and 10 on the scale. The virus can survive in skin fat for 300 days, the meat of infected pigs for a few months at 4Â°C and in salted and dried meat for 120 days. The virus can last over a year in blood, a few months in boneless meat and even a few years in frozen carcasses (
