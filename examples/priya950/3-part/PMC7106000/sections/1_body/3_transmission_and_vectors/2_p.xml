<p>Because warthogs do not disseminate the disease among themselves, the participation of ticks seems to be indispensable in maintaining the sylvatic transmission cycle. Epidemiologically significant is the presence of vertical transmission in the ticks, which may be transovarial (from female to offspring) and transstadial (between developmental stages of ticks). Transstadial, transovarial, and sexual transmission were observed in 
 <italic>O. moubata</italic>, while in 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> only transstadial transmission was observed (
