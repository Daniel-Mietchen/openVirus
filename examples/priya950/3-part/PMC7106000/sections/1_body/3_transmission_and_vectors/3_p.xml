<p>On the European continent hard ticks belonging to the 
 <italic>Ixodidae</italic> family are the most numerous. There are two species of hard ticks commonly found in Europe: the common tick (
 <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic>) and the meadow tick (
 <italic>Dermacentor reticulatus</italic>). Scientific research shows that there is no replication of ASFV in these ticks. For this reason, neither species is a biological vector for ASFV. However, the virus can survive in these ticks for six to eight weeks. This fact makes 
 <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> and 
 <italic>Dermacentor reticulatus</italic> potential mechanical vectors (
 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0001_ref_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). There are no ticks from the 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> genus in Poland, however, it is possible for these ticks to be introduced from endemic areas together with imported animals.
