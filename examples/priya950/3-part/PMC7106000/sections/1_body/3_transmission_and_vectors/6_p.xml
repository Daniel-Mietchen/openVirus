 <bold>Straw</bold>. The source of the virus for domestic pigs may be straw obtained from areas where wild boars occur. Wild boars are the main species of free-living animals that pollute meadows and crops with their droppings. In several documented cases, the source of a new outbreak of ASF was straw harvested from nearby fields where wild boars were found. However, if the straw comes from commercial sources where appropriate drying processes have been applied, the risk of introducing ASF by this route is negligible. Other sources of virus transmission include feeding pigs with contaminated meat, swill, and contact with contaminated objects (clothing, car tyres, or hunting equipment).
