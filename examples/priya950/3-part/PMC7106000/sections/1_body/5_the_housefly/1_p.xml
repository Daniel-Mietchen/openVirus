<p>During millions of years of evolution, insects have adapted to life in all environments. Among insects in close proximity to humans and animals, some species are dangerous. The most dangerous scenario is the transmission of pathogens that threaten the health and lives of people and animals, and the housefly (
 <italic>Musca domestica</italic>) is one such insect that can transmit many pathogens (

The speed of the fly’s progress through the life cycle depends to a large extent on factors such as the freshness of the fertiliser and usually lasts from several days to two months. The life cycle of a housefly also largely depends on the ambient temperature in which the larvae live. The higher the temperature, the shorter the development time. For example, at 25°C development takes about two weeks. It should also be remembered that in faeces and various types of organic waste, the temperature is higher than the ambient temperature and allows the development of flies in unfavourable environmental conditions, for example during winter months.
