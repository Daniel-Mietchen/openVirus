<p>RV infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage and a wide range of manifestations referred to as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). As summarized elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B33-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the most common defects, as the classic triad, affect the ears (sensorineural deafness), eyes (cataract, glaucoma, retinopathy, and microphthalmia), and heart (patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery). Mental retardation as a sign of central nervous system (CNS) impairment is also noted. While most of the manifestations are permanent, some are of a temporary nature (e.g., hepatosplenomegaly or bone lesions) or become apparent only later in life (e.g., diabetes mellitus type 1). In the first trimester, CRS and, only occasionall, miscarriages and spontaneous abortions occur, but defects are rarely seen after the 16th week of gestation [
