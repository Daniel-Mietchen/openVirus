<p>Comparable to other viruses that are transmitted by arthropod vectors, IFNAR−/− mice lacking the receptor for type I interferons (IFN-α and -β) are a suitable experimental model for ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B69-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Any type I interferon that is produced by infected cells within this animal model is not bound by their receptor, neither on the infected cell itself (autocrine) nor on neighboring, uninfected cells (paracrine). Thus, the type I IFN-associated antiviral state as a crucial determinant of susceptibility to ZIKV is not generated. Immunocompetent wild-type mice are resistant to ZIKV and lack disease symptoms and signs of virus replication [
 <xref rid="B70-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In humans, ZIKV counteracts IFN pathway activation through targeting signal transducer of transcription 2 (STAT2) for degradation by the viral non-structural protein 5 [
 <xref rid="B71-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This viral strategy of immune evasion is not active against mouse STAT2 [

 <xref rid="B18-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Eventually, this fundamental finding led to the generation of a human STAT2-knock-in immunocompetent mouse model for ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B72-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Pregnant mouse models of ZIKV infection provided valuable insights into congenital ZIKV infection through recapitulation of several aspects identified in the human disease [
 <xref rid="B73-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Non-human primates are a more suitable model for human pregnancy than mice, which is related to the structure of their placenta and the gestational time, but depends on the species (pigtail and rhesus macaques) used as a model for congenital ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B74-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, in comparison to humans, these non-human primate models appear to display a prolonged viremia [
 <xref rid="B73-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Additionally, rather, pathologic consequences are noted in association with the virus-induced immune response. Thus, the validation of their suitability as animal models for congenital ZIKV infection necessitates further research [
