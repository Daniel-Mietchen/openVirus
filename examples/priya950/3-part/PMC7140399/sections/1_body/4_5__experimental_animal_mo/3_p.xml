<p>Although transplacental passage of RV was demonstrated for some animal species, including rhesus monkeys [

 <xref rid="B76-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], none of them reflected the persistent infection in human fetuses, or the teratogenic effects noted for congenital RV infection. In the study published by Parkman in 1965, pregnant rhesus monkeys were inoculated intravenously or intramuscularly with RV during the 4th or 19th week of gestation. However, although several aspects of the human course of infection, such as rate of transmission to the fetus and the presence of a viremia in pregnant animals, were reflected, no malformations were present in the embryos and fetuses [

This complements the restrictions of the use of animal models in congenital virology as outlined before, which includes the use of MCMV as mouse homolog for HCMV and, in the case of ZIKV, the requirement of an immunocompromised mouse model for disease pathology assessment.
