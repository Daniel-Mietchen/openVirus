<p>The application of experimental animal models for congenital infections in humans reveals essential disease mechanisms, but comes with several restrictions due to human-specific aspects. In the case of HCMV, the newborn mouse and guinea pig model were employed in assessment of virus-induced brain pathology [

 <xref rid="B64-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], respectively. However, species specificity in general limits the use of animal models to the analysis of only some of the symptoms of congenital HCMV infection [

 <xref rid="B65-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) was used as a close relative of HCMV in the mouse model and, as such, as a stand in for congenital HCMV infections. This includes intraperitoneal inoculation of newborn mice with MCMV as a neurodevelopmental counterpart of second trimester human fetuses [

 <xref rid="B66-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Furthermore, intraplacentally inoculated MCMV revealed impairment of the olfactory bulb structure and a reduced number of bulbar dopaminergic cells, together with an olfactory deficit as a sign of neuronal damage that can be noted before the onset of hearing loss [
