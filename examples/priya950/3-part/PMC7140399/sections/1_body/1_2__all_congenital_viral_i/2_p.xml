<p>The formation of the human placenta is initiated at 5 to 7 days postconception (day 0 is defined as the day when fertilization of the ovum occurs, which is thereafter called the zygote) by the initial contact of the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst with the maternal uterine epithelium, the endometrium, which converts into the decidua. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00542-f001">Figure 1</xref>A shows the structure of a human pre-implantation blastocyst together with the timeline of the formation of the placenta in relation to the timeline of maternal RV infection that could result in congenital malformations. RV can be teratogenic from early pregnancy onward [

The anchorage of the blastocyst is followed by transformation of the trophoblast layer into the syncytiotrophoblast (present as a multinucleated syncytium) and the cytotrophoblast (CTB) as the outer and inner layer, respectively (

Between 5 and 12 weeks postconception, the maternal circulation is restructured such that the hemochorial human placenta is characterized by direct contact between maternal blood and tissue directly facing the fetal membranes within the placenta [
