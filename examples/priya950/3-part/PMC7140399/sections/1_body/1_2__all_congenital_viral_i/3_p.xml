<p>In utero transplacental transmission of pathogens can occur through passage from maternal endothelial microvasculature to endovascular extravillous CTBs or through transfer from infected immune cells to placental syncytiotrophoblasts [
 <xref rid="B13-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Different susceptibilities are prevalent between the two trophoblast cell types, the syncytiotrophoblasts, and the CTBs. Whereas the former is rather resistant to virus infections or shows a low rate of infection, the latter is susceptible to a number of viruses [
 <xref rid="B13-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A detailed and in-depth review on how viruses passage across first-trimester placentas can be found elsewhere [

 <xref rid="B15-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the case of HCMV, the routes of transmission are complex and involve several cell types in the decidua. As shown through HCMV infection of first-trimester decidual organ cultures, CTBs, endothelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells were among the cell types targeted, and viral spread occurred preferentially by cell-to-cell transmission [
 <xref rid="B16-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To reach and infect CTBs, immune complexes composed of maternal IgGs and HCMV virions could pass the syncytium through transcytosis based on the neonatal Fc receptor transport system [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There is also a wealth of literature available for ZIKV transplacental passage. Multiple studies were performed on mid- and late gestation placentas, explants from first-trimester chorionic villi, human placenta cell lines, human trophoblasts from mid- and late gestation placentas, and even trophoblast cells derived from hESCs, for which a comprehensive overview is provided by Tan et al. in supplementary Tables 1 and 2 [
 <xref rid="B18-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In their study, Tan et al. analyzed ZIKV infection at the stage of pre- and peri-implantation blastocysts as the earliest embryonal stage possible [
 <xref rid="B18-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Blastocyst implantation in the endometrium occurs at a position that allows for attachment of the trophoblast layer to endometrial epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B19-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The invasion of the blastocyst into the epithelium of the uterus results in a multitude of changes of the endometrium, summarized in the term decidualization, and generates an embryonal-maternal interface [
 <xref rid="B19-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Through this, the embryonal compartment is potentially accessible for embryotoxic or teratogenic substances or pathogens. Tan et al. used ex vivo mouse and human blastocyst cultures, hESC-derived trophectoderm (TE) cells, and the mouse as an in vivo model to analyze virus susceptibility and infection of pre-and peri-implantation staged blastocysts [
 <xref rid="B18-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ex vivo infection of mouse and human blastocysts with ZIKV revealed viral replication in TE cells, which was further confirmed by the susceptibility of hESC-derived TE cells to ZIKV. Furthermore, mice were infected with ZIKV at embryonal day (E) 2.5 and E3.5 before implantation of the blastocyst at E4.5. Thereafter, blastocysts were flushed out and cultivated ex vivo for an additional 24 h. The presence of ZIKV-positive cells in these blastocysts confirmed that pre-implantation infection of the dam can be transmitted to pre-implantation embryos [
 <xref rid="B18-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results challenge our general concept of infections of the developing human embryo. How viruses could get access to pre-implantation blastocysts remains an open question. However, these observations are supported by the clinical data that define the time window during which maternal rubella can cause congenital defects in the embryo (
