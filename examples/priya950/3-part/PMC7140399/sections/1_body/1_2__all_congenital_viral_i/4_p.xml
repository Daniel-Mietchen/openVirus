<p>In contrast to HCMV and ZIKV, the mode of transplacental passage of RV is rather ill defined and not well studied. Transplacental passage of RV is linked to viremia, as the appearance of the rash in the infected mother can be linked to congenital rubella (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00542-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Infection after the last menstrual period and before conception does not lead to congenital defects, whereas the first 11 weeks postconception are critical [

They describe lesions and focal damage of syncytiotrophoblasts and CTBs in the chorion and hypothesize, indicating that the spread of infected, desquamated cells of the chorion to the fetal system could be a possible mode of virus transfer. This is supported by the identification of viral antigens in endothelial cells and basal decidua in a placenta donated by a mother with RV infection in the first trimester of pregnancy [
