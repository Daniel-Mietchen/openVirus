<p>The main focus of this review is set on defects associated with viral transplacental transmission during the first trimester of pregnancy. Thus, the immunopathological consequences of the maternal immune response to infections and the impairment of placental functions by inflammatory processes are not addressed. For these more indirect aspects of a virus infection, the reader is referred to other reviews, e.g., [

Among the genes that contribute to this placental safeguard shield are members of the ISG family, such as IFN Î»2 and interferon alpha-inducible protein 6, which are induced in placenta explants upon ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B8-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Originally, they were identified as top ranked genes by a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) activation screen performed in modified Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but were also expressed in ZIKV-infected ex vivo placenta explants [

 <xref rid="B10-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] refractory to ZIKV infection. This emphasizes the contributory role of the IFN system for the placental barrier function.
