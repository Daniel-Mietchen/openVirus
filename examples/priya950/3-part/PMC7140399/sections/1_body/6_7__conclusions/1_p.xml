<p>With this review, we have addressed the possibilities offered by novel stem cell-based cell culture models for the study of the clinical presentation following congenital virus infections. We also want to stress the potential use of viruses such as HCMV, ZIKV, and RV, with their well-defined clinical symptoms during congenital virus infections, for the identification of novel gene functions and regulatory networks during human embryonal development. The combination of congenital virology with the continuous advancements of stem cell-based technology will complement developmental biology and extend our current way of getting information on the function of genes that are active in human development. Our knowledge of human development is, so far, to a large extent fueled by our knowledge from naturally occurring mutations. Data gained on congenital virus infections in stem cell-based models will also help us to better understand deleterious pregnancy outcomes. Moreover, the validation of iPSC-based cell culture models for the study of human development through infection with teratogenic viruses with well-known aetiologies will provide a framework for pathogens with unknown teratogenic potential. We will be able to meet the constraints posed by emerging viruses and to confirm the safety of viral vaccines for their application during pregnancies. We have never been so close to the experimental assessment of the open questions from teratogenic alterations during human pregnancies. Despite the remaining challenges, this is an exciting outlook.</p>
