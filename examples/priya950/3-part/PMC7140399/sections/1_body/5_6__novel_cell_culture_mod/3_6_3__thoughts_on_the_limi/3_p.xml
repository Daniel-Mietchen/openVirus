<p>Currently, rodents are broadly applied for the modelling of infectious diseases including congenital viral infections. One can conclude that species-specific differences most probably represent a major road block for the development of drugs and vaccines besides toxicological testing. However, species differences could also broaden our view on the evolution of humans and the co-evolution of congenital virus infections. Through the application of the iPSC technology to various species, including members of the great apes, we could address species-specific differences in congenital virus infections. Similar studies have already been conducted to address questions on human evolution. The comparison of endodermal differentiation that was induced in human and chimpanzee iPSCs revealed conserved, but also divergent evolutionary circuits [

In turn, recent work by the group of Michael Drukker indicates that the findings on gene-regulatory networks in human pluripotent stem cells could be verified in vivo using monkey embryos. In their study, they have not only confirmed the essential role played by GATA3 during TE specification through in vitro assays based on human pluripotent stem cells, but they have also assessed the in vivo role of GATA3 in embryonic development in primates through microinjection of GATA3 morpholino antisense oligonucleotides into zygotes of rhesus macaques. Zygotes were differentiated in vitro and analyzed, which revealed embryonal arrest at the 32-cell morula state [
