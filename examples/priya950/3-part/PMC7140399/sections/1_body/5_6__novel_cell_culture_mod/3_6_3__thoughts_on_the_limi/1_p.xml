<p>Human ESCs and iPSCs share almost all characteristics of pluripotent cells. However, gene expression profiles of different iPS cell lines are very similar, but not identical to human ESCs [
 <xref rid="B113-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Some issues remain due to differently expressed genes that are retained from the somatic donor cells or are induced during reprogramming. Moreover, different cell types are used for generation of iPSCs in combination with a diversity of reprogramming procedures, as addressed in a recent review [
 <xref rid="B113-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. This leads to variations in reprogramming efficiencies and iPSC quality and, subsequently, to a heterogeneity of iPS cell lines as a major challenge of iPSC-based research questions.
