<p>Pluripotent stem cells enable the differentiation of mature and functional cells, tissues, and organoids mimicking the (1) differentiation and maturation status of cells, (2) the specific cell composition of a certain tissue, (3) physical impulses necessary for maturation, and (4) the three-dimensional structure of certain tissues. However, there are technical limitations for reconstructing embryonal and developing tissues and organs for a more precise analysis of congenital virus infections. Accordingly, there is a need for pluripotent stem cell-based models for advanced three-dimensional in vitro models that closely resemble the in vivo situation. The importance of such three-dimensional scaffolds is exemplified by brain organoids that, in contrast to neuronal cell culture, reflect at least some parts of the architecture in early embryonal brain tissue. The recent review by Chen et al. does not only summarize the advancements in brain organoid technology over the past five years, but also their application in the study of human diseases, including ZIKV microcephaly [

This review by Chen et al. also covers recent drug screening approaches against ZIKV on brain organoids, which allow for assessment of antiviral drugs on brain organoid structure and viability and integrity of the cortex. Among those is 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which is converted from cholesterol by the enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase and for which an antiviral effectiveness against ZIKV was shown in animal studies, whereas the reduction of ZIKV-induced cell death was not appreciable on human brain organoids [

Furthermore, brain organoids allow for genetic engineering assays, which will provide mechanistic insights into the ways neurotropic viruses such as ZIKV interact with their human host. They also complement vaccine development and the assessment of vaccine efficacy and safety. Together, two-dimensional and three-dimensional pluripotent stem cell-based in vitro models hold great promise for the understanding of congenital viral diseases and the currently poorly understood infection of the embryo. However, technical advancement is necessary in the field of translational medicine aimed at the transfer of stem cell-based virology research from bench to bedside.
