<p>In contrast to infectivity by HCMV, iPSCs are susceptible and permissive to ZIKV and RV [

 <xref rid="B106-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Among the plethora of original research articles and review literature on pluripotent stem cell-derived models for ZIKV-associated microcephaly and its neurotropism, we can only highlight a few. The models summarized hereafter [

 <xref rid="B108-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] reflect developmental stages of 5 to 8 up to 10-week-old human embryos. Defined chemical conditions allowed for differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into NPCs from forebrain dorsal, forebrain ventral, and hindbrain and spinal cord brain organoids. Their infection with ZIKV was associated with growth arrest and apoptosis. Additionally, overactivation of ISGs was induced in an IFN-independent manner through IRF3- and NF-ÎšB-associated pathways [
 <xref rid="B107-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The study by Dang et al. used immature three-dimensonal cerebral organoids after 10 days of differentiation as a model for the impact of ZIKV on neurodevelopmental processes. After five days of infection, a reduction in organoid size was detected that appeared to be due to loss of the NPC pool as the main cell type targeted by ZIKV. Additionally, activation of TLR3 affected TLR3-regulated networks that direct neurogenesis and apoptosis within NPCs of these cerebral organoids [
 <xref rid="B108-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. This is in contrast to the findings of Liu et al., which did not identify boosting of TLR3 signaling during ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B107-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. This may be due to the different NPC populations involved in both studies; rather pure NPCs by Liu et al. as opposed to NPCs within cerebral organoids of a later stage of differentiation by Dang et al. [

 <xref rid="B108-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. This highlights how important it is to consider, not only different cell types, but also stage-specific effects within these models while addressing mechanisms during congenital virus infections. Complementing this data on the impact of ZIKV on cerebral organoids, iPSC-derived human retinal epithelium (RPE) was employed to address ocular defects noted after congenital ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B109-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Transepithelial resistance of the RPE, as well as cell junctions and, thus, RPE architecture, were impaired after ZIKV infection. As a follow-up of these observations, a strong inflammatory response, as revealed by induction of IFNs, was identified in RPE after ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B110-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The relevance of inflammation as an effective host countermeasure against ZIKV infection is emphasized by the sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 2 (SOX2)-dependent susceptibility of glioblastoma stem cells, as SOX2 expression was associated with a reduced innate antiviral response [
