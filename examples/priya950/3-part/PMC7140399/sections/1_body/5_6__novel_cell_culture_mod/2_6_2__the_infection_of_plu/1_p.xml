<p>In the context of the implications that pluripotent stem cell-based models may have for our current concept of congenital virology, a justified question may arise on their relevance for addressing research questions on congenital infections. Human embryonic stem cell lines originate from the inner cell mass of human blastocysts, which were derived through cultivation of embryos donated by participants of in vitro fertilization programs [

 <sup>-/-</sup> mouse model confirmed experimentally in the vertical transmission mouse model that pre-implantation infection of the dam can be transmitted to pre-implantation blastocysts [

This emphasizes the relevance of ESCs and, as such, iPSCs for the study of viral alterations during the very early stages of human pregnancies. The study by Tan et al. also revealed a dose-dependent effect of ZIKV on blastocyst proliferation, which complied with the paradigm shift of the all-or-none hypothesis, as outlined before. At high viral doses of ZIKV, infection resulted in cell death of TE cells, whereas low doses allowed for viral propagation and potentially for in vivo transmission of infectious viruses to other cell populations during embryonal development [
