<p>The implication of the two pluripotent stem cell lines, ESCs and iPSCs, as a suitable model system for congenital virology is two-fold. First, the outer-lining of the blastocyst, the trophoblast, can be modelled through trophoblast differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. Second, the epiblast, which gives rise to the three embryonic germ layers, can be recapitulated through two- and three-dimensional differentiation approaches and reflect early gastrulation-like developmental stages. Already in 2002, the first protocol on differentiation of hESCs into trophoblasts was published [

Li et al. could show that hESCs differentiate into an early CTB-like phenotype before further differentiation into terminally differentiated syncytiotrophoblasts and extravillous trophoblasts. A similar approach of TE differentiation of ESCs was pursued by Tan et al., which generated hESC-derived TE cells and confirmed that they were identical to the in vivo counterparts isolated from human blastocysts [
