<p>Pluripotent stem cell-based models mimic early human development through the application of various defined protocols to initiate differentiation. This can be done in two or in three dimensions, as exemplified by the formation of stem cell aggregates, the so-called embryoid bodies (EBs). In vitro differentiation can be spontaneous (undirected), as in the case of EB formation, or directed along a specific developmental route. Directed differentiation can also be initiated in adherent cell cultures or EBs through the addition of defined growth factors and pharmacological compounds [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00542-f002">Figure 2</xref>B illustrates the first steps of human embryogenesis, which can be modelled with pluripotent stem cells. There is continuous research on the reproduction of spatial processes within such model systems and culminates so far in the morphogenesis of organoids such as the optic cup [

 <xref rid="B90-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In addition to these retinal organoids, the ability to reflect the spatial organization of the embryo in vitro is also shown through cerebral organoids as three-dimensional, multicellular models for studying the processes during organogenesis [

Besides these steps that follow implantation of the blastocyst, a recent addition to the cabinet filled with technological breakthroughs in stem cell biology is the three-channel microfluidic device with matrix pouches as a hESCs- or hiPSCs-based advanced model of the spatial events at the peri-implantation stage [
