<p>As highlighted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00542-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, human population-based studies can identify host genetic factors with an impact on susceptibility to a virus infection or severity of the associated disease. The challenge in the field of congenital virus infections lies in the differential host genetic contribution by the mother and the fetus or newborn on disease progression as their genetic background is not identical. Additionally, the immune response appears to be of central importance, which could mask genetic variants of developmental pathway components. One of the examples of contributing immunological factors is toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) 2258 G&gt;A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which was associated with a higher risk of congenital CMV infection in a cohort of Polish fetuses and newborns [

Host genetics is a rather new approach in congenital virology and, especially during the recent ZIKV epidemics in Brazil, host genetic factors were identified. A case-control study of a Brazilian cohort identified a statistically significant association of maternal adenylate cyclase genes with the development of CZS [

The potential these case-control studies hold for hiPSC-based models was revealed by the analysis of possible host genetic variants in NPCs derived from hiPSC generated from erythroblasts from a healthy control group and from the following pairs of Brazilian twins that were exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy: monozygotic twins equally affected (concordant) and dizygotic twins with one CZS-affected and one unaffected (discordant) twin [
 <xref rid="B87-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) performed on these NPCs identified DDIT4L as the gene with the most significant difference in expression between the CZS-affected and the unaffected group. The reduction of DDIT4L expression as an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR signaling was accompanied by differences in the activity of the mTOR pathway between these two groups [
 <xref rid="B87-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Although no main gene locus was assigned, individual differences in host signaling pathways such as mTOR reflect differences in the host response to a virus infection [
 <xref rid="B87-cells-09-00542" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. On the one hand, iPSCs carrying a certain DNA risk variant provide a powerful tool for the functional analysis of DNA variants and their impact on onset, progression, and treatment of infectious diseases. On the other hand, in combination with genetic engineering approaches, they could compensate for the lack of healthy controls with the identical genetic background during population-based studies (
