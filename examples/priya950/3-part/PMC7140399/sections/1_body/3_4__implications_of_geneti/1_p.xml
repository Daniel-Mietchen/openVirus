<p>Viral pathogenesis and disease-associated characteristics, such as those occurring during congenital infections, can differ among clinical isolates of human-pathogenic viruses. Such strain-specific differences occur in vitro as well as in vivo through viral adaptation to its host cell or human host, respectively. In the case of HCMV, these adaptations can occur at a fast rate. A recent review summarizes how this could hamper research on HCMV. Low-passaged HCMV strains are usually cell-associated, which restricts their use in experimental characterizations. During cell culture adaptation, HCMV strains acquire mutations and a reduced level of cell association and, thus, produce higher titers [

These in vitro adaptations during cultivation of HCMV in cell culture are complemented by the in vivo variation among HCMV isolates, which reflects their complex interaction with the host immune system [
