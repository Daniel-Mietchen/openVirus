  <p>Timeline of congenital defects from maternal rubella virus (RV) infection in relation to embryonal stages. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The timeline of maternal RV infection with a high rate of congenital defects is given in direct comparison to first trimester embryonal development. The timeline refers to gestational age and starts from the first day of the last menstrual period. Highlighted is the blastocyst, which is composed of the embryoblast as the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm or trophoblast as its outer cell layer. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The inner cell mass of the blastocyst, the so-called embryoblast, transforms into a double layer, the hypoblast and epiblast. The hypoblast or primitive endoderm develops into the fluid-filled amniotic cavity, which later harbors the embryo. The epiblast gives rise to the embryo, which results in formation of the embryonic disc. The implantation of the blastocyst is followed by infiltration with maternal immune cells, which could potentially provide access of RV to the embryo. The question mark indicates this hypothesized mode of viral transfer. As a reference for (
