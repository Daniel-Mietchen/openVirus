<p>A total of 4050 samples from other body fluids have also been tested: breast milk (n = 168, 109 patients), saliva (n = 900, 454 patients), cervicovaginal secretions (n = 549, 273 patients), feces (n = 558, 330 patients), and urine (n = 1875, 593 patients) (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In general, more than 1 sample was tested per patient with a mean number of 1.57 samples/patient for breast milk, 1.98 for saliva, 2.1 for cervicovaginal fluid, 1.7 for feces, and 3.2 for urine. A total of 4637 RT-PCR tests were realized: RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR (n = 997), NP qRT-PCR assays (n = 3312), BioFire (n = 258), and Xpert Ebola (n = 70). For 653 samples, RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR and NP qRT-PCR assays have been tested in parallel with similar results. Ebola viral RNA was detected in 2 saliva samples from a single female patient on samples taken 5 and 34 days after discharge from ETU and in 3 urine samples from 2 male patients on samples taken 7, 43, and 55 days after discharge from ETU (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary </xref>Table S1) for up to 6 and 7 months. On 16 breast milk samples, retested with Ebola Xpert assay, 1 (ID1034) was positive on a sample at 58 days (Ct values for GP = 39.8 and NP = 36.4), and subsequent testing of 54 samples, not tested previously, revealed an additional woman (identification [ID] 3082) positive on the first sample taken after 500 days (Ct values for GP = 36.3 and NP = 32.2). Additional samples were only available 2 years later for the first patient (ID 1034), but, for the second patient (ID 3082), the 5 subsequent samples were taken between 1 and 10 months later, and all tested negative. The latter woman (ID 3082) was not pregnant when she developed EVD, and she had 2 children aged 6 and 2.5 years when she was at the ETU. She became pregnant 7 months after discharge from ETU and was included in the PostEbogui study when she attended the hospital for a visit related to complications at 8 months of pregnancy. The breast milk sample, taken 1 month after delivery (ie, 500 days after discharge from ETU), tested positive for EBOV RNA. Because of this unusual and late presence of viral RNA in breast milk, the breast milk samples from both women have been retested on the same and on a duplicate aliquot, confirming the results.
