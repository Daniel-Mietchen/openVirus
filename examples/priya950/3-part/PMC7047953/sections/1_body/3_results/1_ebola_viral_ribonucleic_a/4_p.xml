<p>Mean age was comparable in positive versus negative patients (33.45 versus 32.68 years, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .7), but we observed a positive and significant relationship between older age and the period of viral RNA detection in semen (r = 0.51, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .0065). Eye pain and joint pain were more often reported in patients with viral RNA in semen; 11 of 27 (40.7%) versus 54 of 246 (21.9%) and 24 of 27 (88.9%) versus 175 of 246 (71.1%), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that eye pain (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.56; 95% CI, 1.04–6.20; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .036) and joint pain (AOR = 3.71; 95% CI, 1.16–16.70; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .047) were significantly associated with RNA detection in semen.
