<p>Modeling of viral RNA persistence in semen after discharge from ETU showed a median estimated time of 204.6 days (95% CI, 160.7–240.7) with Ebola Xpert, which is significantly longer than the time estimated with NP qRT-PCR and RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR: 48.22 days (95% CI, 13.82–84.37) and 41.77 days (95% CI, 1.47–98.80), respectively (

The probability of remaining positive for Ebola RNA in semen was estimated at 93.02% and 60.12% after 3 and 6 months, respectively, decreasing to 27.68% and 10.32% after 9 and 12 months, respectively, reaching 0.96% after 18 months, and becoming close to zero (0.06%) after 24 months (
