<p>The PostEbogui cohort included 360 male survivors, and 277 (77%) donated a semen sample at least once. The median time between discharge from ETU and semen donation was 14.4 months (IQR, 9–18.9; minimum 0.2 and maximum 47.2) for the first sample and 41.7 months (IQR, 24.8–47.5; minimum 2.5 and maximum 56.4) for the last one (

A total of 1777 PCR tests have been realized on 1368 samples (mean 4.9 samples/patient; minimum 1 and maximum 12): 620 samples were tested with RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR, 531 samples were tested with an in-house NP qRT-PCR assay, and 626 samples were tested with Ebola Xpert. In 2017, a higher sensitivity was reported for Ebola Xpert assay on semen samples [

Ten of 14 patients, with sufficient leftover semen sample and who tested positive with RealStar and/or in-house NP assays, also tested positive with Ebola Xpert (

It is interesting to note that retrospective retesting with Ebola Xpert identified 13 additional patients with viral RNA in semen. When combining the results of all assays, 27 patients tested positive for viral RNA in at least 1 semen sample (
