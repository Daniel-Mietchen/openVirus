<p>The major route of human-to-human transmission of EBOV is direct contact with infected body fluids from symptomatic or deceased patients. However, episodes of EBOV re-emergence and unusual transmission chains have been reported in the West African outbreak [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6–10</xref>]. The majority of these episodes were associated with viral persistence in semen, but transmission chains through other body fluids (breast milk, cervicovagianl fluids) are also suspected [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref>]. The persistence of EBOV in body fluids was already shown in the outbreak from Kikwit, DRC in 1995, and the large number of EBOV survivors from the West African outbreak increased our knowlegde, especially in semen [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14–22</xref>]. In this report, we studied in detail viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) shedding in semen and other body fluids at a regular base period over a 4-year time frame in the PostEbogui cohort, which included 800 of 1270 EVD survivors from Guinea.
