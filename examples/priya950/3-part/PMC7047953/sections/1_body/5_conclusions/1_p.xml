<p>Overall, the data from our study clearly confirm the persistence of viral RNA in semen for up to 6 months in a large number of male survivors. More important, we showed that female EBV survivors who become pregnant after the disease can be positive for viral RNA in breastmilk even 500 days after ETU discharge. Similar to other studies, we also show that RNA detection decays over time in semen at variable rates in different survivors, and, as a consequence, transmission risks decrease due to lower inoculum, nonviable virus, or other factors. Nevertheless, these data illustrate the importance of prevention measures and biological monitoring of male EVD survivors. More studies are needed on pregnant women, including when pregnancy occurred after discharge from ETU, to evaluate whether pregnancy can have an impact on relapse of EVD and to educate healthcare workers on this potential risk. The World Health Organization now recommends vaccination for contacts of patients to stop rapidly viral transmission from symptomatic cases, and it can be expected that timely vaccination of contacts will also prevent or reduce sexual transmission. Systematic treatment with an effective antiviral Ebola drug should also be explored for the clearance of virus in body fluids.</p>
