<p>Information on presence and persistence of EBOV or Ebola viral RNA in body fluids is essential to evaluate and manage disease transmission from EVD survivors. The majority of our knowledge is from semen and few data are available on other body fluids. In this report, we studied, in a systematic way, the presence of viral RNA in semen over time but also in a large number of other body fluids including saliva, urine, cervicovaginal fluid, breast milk and feces in EVD survivors from the PostEbogui cohort [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. More than 5400 samples from different body fluids have been tested by PCR, and more than 1 sample per body fluid has been analyzed for the majority of patients. For a large number of patients, semen samples have been analyzed for up to 40 months after discharge from ETU; for the other body fluids, samples have been analyzed for up to 24 months.
