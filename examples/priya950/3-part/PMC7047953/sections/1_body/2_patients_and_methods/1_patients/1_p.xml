<p>The PostEbogui study is a prospective, multicenter, open cohort study monitoring, on a regular base period, EVD survivors for clinical, biological, and psychosocial parametes as well as presence of viral RNA in different body fluids [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Patients were recruited at any time after discharge between March 2015 and July 2016 from an Ebola treatment unit (ETU) at 4 different sites in Guinea: Donka National Hospital (Conakry), Macenta Prefectoral Hospital (Macenta), N’Zérékoré Regional Hospital (N’Zérékoré), and Forécariah Prefectoral Hospital (Forécariah). The median delay after ETU discharge and study enrollment was 350 days (interquartile range [IQR], 223–491). Patients were assessed at inclusion, 1 and 3 months afterwards, and subsequently every 6 months for up to 40 months. Body fluid sampling was proposed at each visit. One year after initiation of the study, no additional body fluids were collected from patients with 2 consecutive negative tests, except for semen. Semen, breast milk, and urine were collected in sterile containers. Saliva and cervicovaginal fluids were collected using a transport device combining a foam swab and placed into 1-mL viral transport medium (Sigma Virocult) or RNAlater. Feces were stored in RNAlater (1/1 volume). All samples were stored at 2–8°C on site and transported within 24 hours to the laboratory where samples were processed within 2 days or stored frozen at −40°C until testing.
