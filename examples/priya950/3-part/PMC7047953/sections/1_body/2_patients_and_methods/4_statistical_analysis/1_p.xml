<p>To model the time to test negativity in semen, ie, the period between discharge from ETU and the time when viral RNA was no longer detected with RT-PCR techniques, we used a time-to-event analysis as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All male participants who had at least 1 RT-PCR result (positive or negative) were included in the analysis. In brief, men were assumed to be positive at symptom onset and data were interval-censored; for patients with no negative test result after the last positive result, data were right-censored. The parametric survival model assuming a gamma distribution, associated to the highest likelihood with a survival curve similar to the Turnbull non-parametric approach was used. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, with noninformative prior for the parameters, was implemented to obtain the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The relationship between presence of viral RNA in semen and the antibody levels to EBOV antigens (NP, GP, and VP40) or associations with clinical symptoms were studied with a logistic regression model. The effects of the factors were analyzed by using the multivariate models with a 95% CI. All analyses were done using Stata and R softwares. We used Fisherâ€™s exact test to compare percentages.
