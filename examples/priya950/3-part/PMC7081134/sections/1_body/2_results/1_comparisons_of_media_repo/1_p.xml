<p>The large majority of the weekly number of news articles from the Coosto search (n=730) during the 2017/2018 influenza season in the Netherlands coincided with the influenza epidemic as defined by the ILI incidence (
 <xref rid="figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The peak in ILI incidence preceded the peak in the number of articles by 5 weeks. The ILI incidence reached a peak in week 4 of 2018 and remained high until week 10 of 2018, while the media coverage increased later from around week 9 and reached a peak in week 11 of 2018. Both trends show a steep decrease after week 10 and 11, respectively. On visual inspection, similar trends were observed for the number of news articles in relation to weekly pneumonia consultations in primary care, SARI surveillance, all-cause mortality, and influenza laboratory diagnoses (
 <xref rid="figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The trends in ILI incidence and media reports are significantly correlated (
 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Correlations were even stronger for pneumonia in primary care, SARI in the JBH, influenza laboratory diagnoses, and all-cause mortality (
