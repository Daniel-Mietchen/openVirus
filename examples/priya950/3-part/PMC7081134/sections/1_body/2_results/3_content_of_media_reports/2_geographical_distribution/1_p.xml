<p>Results from the content analysis show that 52 different hospital organizations were named in the included news articles with 69 hospital locations. These included 5 academic teaching hospitals, 1 childrenâ€™s hospital, 35 top clinical teaching hospitals, and 28 general hospitals. These locations were spread across the Netherlands (
 <xref rid="figure3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Of the 69 hospital locations, 23 (33%) reported a large increase in influenza patients but were still able to cope with the number of admitted patients. The remaining 46 (46/69, 67%) hospitals had to take measures at least once during the influenza season; 29 (29/69, 63%) hospitals had to postpone nonurgent surgical procedures, 9 (9/69, 20%) instated a temporary admission stop, and 8 (8/69, 17%) had to take both of these measures (postponing surgery and admission stop). Of these 46 hospital locations, 20 (43%) indicated that the epidemic caused the largest problems in the emergency department (ED). A total of 25 of the 46 hospitals also indicated problems because of staff shortages towing to sick leave caused by influenza. Furthermore, 13 hospitals mentioned a stagnating flow of patients from the hospital to nursing homes. This concerned elderly patients for whom ongoing hospitalization was not medically indicated but who could not be discharged because of social reasons.
