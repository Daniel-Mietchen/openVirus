<p>On the basis of media reports, the 2017/2018 influenza season clearly had a big impact on Dutch hospitals throughout the country. It confirms that real-time data on influenza-related hospital admissions are needed at local, regional, and national level to inform decision making for preparedness and public health response. Improving SARI surveillance was also one of the recommendations of the Outbreak Management Team that was convened by the Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control in response to the severe influenza epidemic. In the absence of a sustainable and robust SARI surveillance program, retrospective analysis of media reports on hospitalized influenza patients offers useful information about the impact of an influenza epidemic. However, using media reports for near real-time surveillance of hospitalized influenza cases with respect to preparedness and emergency control is less suitable because of the longer time lag between detection of the event and published media reports compared with other available surveillance systems. This is in line with a study by de Lange et al [
