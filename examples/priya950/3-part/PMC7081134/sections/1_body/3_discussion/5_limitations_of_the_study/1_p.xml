<p>A limitation of using media reports for surveillance purposes is the potential selectivity of media reporting and thereby, the introduction of selection bias. Especially, reporting on response measures is of concern because it is unclear whether the report was initiated by a specific health event or by the hospitalsâ€™ aim for media attention. Moreover, performing qualitative content analysis on media reports is time consuming, and the choice of items to be analyzed is still rather arbitrary. Developing an automated surveillance system would be better to extract information.</p>
