<p>In the absence of nationally representative SARI surveillance, nontraditional Web-based data sources could improve the SARI surveillance. We could not identify previous reports in which media content was analyzed to assess impact on hospital capacity. However, in recent years, several studies have explored the use of alternative surveillance methods for influenza based on internet search terms. An example of internet-based surveillance system is Google Flu Trends, which monitors health-seeking behavior by using data on influenza-related searches to estimate the incidence of ILI in a specific region [

Multiple other internet-based surveillance systems have been developed over the years; however, it is often complex and cumbersome for epidemiologists to extract the relevant information from large amounts of data on social media or search engine queries [

Furthermore, media reports, in comparison with internet queries, have shown to contain more specific and official data in relation to influenza and other public health problems. In a study based on the 2009 pandemic, media reports were analyzed in relation to several influenza surveillance methods [
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A study by Olayinka et al [
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed that media reports were useful as a supplemental data source for the real-time mortality monitoring related to Hurricane Sandy. As the capacity problems that hospitals faced were reported in local, regional, and national media, these could potentially be a suitable supplemental data source to specifically assess the impact of hospitalized SARI patients during an influenza epidemic.
