  <p>Localization of PX in the nucleus is required for PX-induced apoptosis. (
   <bold>a</bold>) LMH cells were seeded on 12-well plates and cultured overnight, followed by infection with FAdV4 at a MOI of 1 or transfected with pRK5-FLAG-pX at 1 μg per well. Twenty-four hours after treatment, cells were fixed and probed with an anti-PX monoclonal antibody, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (green). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope. The scale bar represents 10 μm. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Schematics represent the genes encoding the full-length or truncated PX molecules (from Δ1 to Δ6). (
   <bold>c</bold>) Distribution of PX or PX-truncated mutants in LMN cells. LMH cells were transfected with indicated plasmids as described in (
   <bold>a</bold>). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed and probed with mouse anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (green). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). LMH cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope. The scale bar represents 10 μm. (

   <bold>e</bold>) Examination of apoptosis in LMH cells expressing PX or PX-truncated mutants. LMH cells were transfected with indicated plasmids as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, stained with Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD, and analyzed by flow cytometry (
   <bold>d</bold>). The percentage of apoptotic cells in (
   <bold>d</bold>) was quantified and shown in (
   <bold>e</bold>). Results are representative of three independent experiments. Data are presented as mean ± SD, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3. The significance of the differences between the groups was performed by one-way ANOVA (*** stands for 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
