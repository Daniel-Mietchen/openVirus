  <p>Mutation of nuclear localization sequences (NLS) on both sides of -FSTKQ- within the amino acids 14-25 of PX affected its nuclear translocation associated with inhibition of PX-induced apoptosis. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Schematics represent the genes encoding the wild-type pX and nuclear localization sequence (NLS) mutant pX molecules (pX-wt, pX-nls1m, pX-nls2m, and pX-nls1/2m). (
   <bold>b</bold>) Distribution of PX or PX-nls-mutants in LMN cells. LMH cells were transfected with indicated plasmids as described in (
   <bold>a</bold>). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed and probed with mouse anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (green). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). LMH cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope. The scale bar represents 10μm. (

   <bold>d</bold>) Examination of apoptosis in LMH cells expressing PX or PX-NLS mutants. LMH cells were transfected with indicated plasmids as described in (
   <bold>a</bold>). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, stained with Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD, and analyzed by flow cytometry (
   <bold>c</bold>). The percentage of apoptotic cells in (
   <bold>c</bold>) was quantified and shown in (
   <bold>d</bold>). Results are representative of three independent experiments. Data are presented as mean ± SD, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3. The significance of the differences between the groups was performed by one-way ANOVA (*** stands for 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
