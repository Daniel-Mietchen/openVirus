  <p>Amino acids 11 and 129 Alanines of PX are crucial to PX-induced apoptosis. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Alignment of PX amino acid sequences of virulent FAdV4 strains isolated in China with that of apathogenic FAdV ON1 strain. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Substitution of aa 11 and 129 alanines by threonines did not affect the localization of PX. LMH cells were seeded on 12-well plates and cultured overnight, followed by transfection with vectors pRK5-FLAG-pXA11T, pRK5-FLAG-pXA129T, and pRK5-FLAG-pXA11/129T, respectively. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed and probed with mouse anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (green). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope. The scale bar represents 10μm. (
   <bold>c</bold> and 
   <bold>d</bold>) Examination of apoptosis in LMH cells expressing PX or PX-mutants. LMH cells were transfected with indicated plasmids as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, stained with Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD, and analyzed by flow cytometry (
   <bold>c</bold>); empty plasmid-transfected cells were used as controls. The percentage of apoptotic cells in (
   <bold>c</bold>) was quantified and shown as in (
   <bold>d</bold>). Results are representative of three independent experiments. Data are presented as mean ± SD, n = 3. The significance of the differences between the groups was performed by one-way ANOVA (** stands for 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and *** for 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
