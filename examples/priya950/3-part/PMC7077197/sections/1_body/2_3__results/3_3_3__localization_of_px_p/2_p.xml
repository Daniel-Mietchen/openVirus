<p>Since PX mutant lacking residues 1–30 amino acids was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, it was intriguing to determine whether the 1–30 amino acids of PX contained nuclear localization sequence (NLS). Therefore, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of PX online (

As a result, it was predicted that the domain of 14–25 amino acids was rich with arginines and lysines, suggesting that this domain might be associated with nuclear localization [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, and the resulting mutants were named PX-nls1m, PX-nls2m, and PX-nls1/2m, respectively. We transfected LMH cells with these pRK5-FLAG-pX mutants and observed the distribution of PX mutant proteins in cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, both PX-nls1m and PX-nls2m mutants were more or less localized in the cytoplasm of transfected cells compared to that of PX-wt controls. In contrast, the PX-nls1/2m mutant was largely localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that the domains containing arginine and lysine residues on both sides of FSTKQ were required for PX nuclear translocation. Concurrently, inhibition of PX from nuclear translocation by mutating the nuclear translocation domains could significantly suppress the PX-induced apoptosis (
