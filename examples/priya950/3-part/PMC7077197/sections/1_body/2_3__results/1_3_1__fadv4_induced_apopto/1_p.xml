<p>To investigate the pathogenesis of FAdV4 infection, we infected Leghorn Male Hepatocellular (LMH) cells, an immortalized chicken liver cell line, with FAdV4, and examined the cytopathic effects (CPE) in virus-infected cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f001">Figure 1</xref>a, FAdV4 infection caused severe CPEs in LMH cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the increase of CPE was correlated with the viral growth in host cells, as shown by increased expressions of hexon, a viral structural protein of FAdV (

To further analyze the cell biological features associated with FAdV4-induced CPE in LMH cells, samples stained for Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD were analyzed by flow cytometry. As a result, the number of Annexin V-positive cells markedly increased 48 h after FAdV4 infection compared to that of mock-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f001">Figure 1</xref>c,d), and similar results were obtained for Annexin V and 7-AAD double positive cells. Furthermore, the number of Annexin V-positive cells could be markedly reduced by caspase inhibitors (z-VAD-fmk, pan-caspase inhibitor; z-DEVD-fmk, caspase-3 inhibitor and z-IETD-fmk, caspase-8 inhibitor) except z-LEHD-fmk, the caspase-9 inhibitor (
