<p>As FAdV4 infection caused apoptosis in LMH cells, we proposed that one or more components of FAdV4 were responsible for FAdV4-induced cell death. To test this hypothesis, we cloned the genes (
 <italic>hexon</italic>, 
 <italic>fiber 1</italic>, 
 <italic>fiber 2</italic>, 
 <italic>pIIIa</italic>, 
 <italic>IVa2</italic>, 
 <italic>pTP</italic>, 
 <italic>pVI</italic>, 
 <italic>pVII</italic>, 
 <italic>pVIII</italic>, 
 <italic>pX</italic> and 
 <italic>penton base</italic>) encoding the indicated proteins of FAdV4 and made a FLAG fusion for each of these indicated proteins and expressed them in LMH cells by transfection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f002">Figure 2</xref>c,d, the number of Annexin V-positive cells significantly increased 48 hours post-transfection with pRK5-FLAG-pX compared to that of controls (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the number of Annexin V-positive cells with pRK5-FLAG-pX transfection could be markedly reduced by caspase inhibitors (z-VAD-fmk, z-DEVD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk) but not by z-LETD-fmk (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f002">Figure 2</xref>e,f). These results indicate that FAdV4 PX is the major viral component responsible for FAdV4-induced apoptosis in LMH cells. To rule out the possibility that the expression of viral protein in cells by transfection may cause artifacts due to the quantity of overexpressed proteins above physiological levels, we compared the quantity of viral PX in FAdV4-infected cells with that of pRK5-FLAG-pX-transfected controls using a Western Blot assay. As a result, the PX expression level in cells transfected with pRK5-FLAG-pX was approximately equivalent to that of viral PX in cells infected with FAdV4 at an MOI of 1 or 10 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f002">Figure 2</xref>g). These data suggest that FAdV4 PX serves as a major apoptosis-inducer during FAdV4 infection in LMH cells.
