<p>Apoptosis is generally considered as a defense mechanism of host cells in response to pathogenic infection. However, some viruses might take advantage of apoptosis for its spread [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It would be intriguing to determine whether FAdV4-induced apoptosis is beneficial to viral replication. We treated LMH cells with z-DEVD-fmk, caspase-3 inhibitors inhibiting apoptosis, and examined viral replication at different time points (12, 24, 36 and 48h) post-infection. As a result, the treatment of cells with z-DEVD-fmk markedly reduced viral loads in both cell cultures and the supernatants compared to that of controls (
