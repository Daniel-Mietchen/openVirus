<p>Taken together, our data show that FAdV4 infection-induced apoptosis in LMH cells, and PX, a structural protein of FAdV4, acts as a major viral factor inducing apoptosis in LMH cells. Furthermore, nuclear translocation of PX is required for PX-induced apoptosis, and aa11 and 129 are crucial to PX-induced apoptosis. Moreover, FAdV4-induced apoptosis facilitates viral replication, suggesting that PX may serve as a virulence factor for FAdV4 infection.</p>
