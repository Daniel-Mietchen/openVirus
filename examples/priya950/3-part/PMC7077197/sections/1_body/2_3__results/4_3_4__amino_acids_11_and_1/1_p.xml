<p>It was reported that the FAdV4 ON1 strain is an isolate from Canada, and this strain is even in the clustering of ON1 strains that were closer to FAdV4 as determined by phylogenetic analysis, while the chicken infected with ON1 strain showed no clinical signs of inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) or inclusion body hepatitis/hydropericardium syndrome (IBH/HPS) [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As PX acts as a major factor responsible for FAdV4-induced apoptosis, we performed the amino acid sequence alignment of ON1 strain PX with that of the virulent FAdV4 strains (including the HuBWH strain, isolated from diseased chickens with IBH by our laboratory) that caused IBH outbreaks in chickens in China. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f005">Figure 5</xref>a, there are only two amino acid differences in PX of the ON1 strain (11 and 129 Threonines) compared with that of virulent FAdV4 strains (11 and 129 alanines) in China. Thus, we proposed that the two sites of FAdV4 PX (aa 11 and 129) might be critical to PX-induced apoptosis and that mutations of aa 11 and 129 would, therefore, reduce PX-induced apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we made mutant constructs pRK5-FLAG-pX-A11T, pRK5-FLAG-pX-A129T, and pRK5-FLAG-pX-A11/129T, transfected these vectors into LMH cells respectively, and examined the localization of these mutants and apoptosis in the transfected cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f005">Figure 5</xref>b, FLAG-pX-WT and all PX mutants were localized in the nucleus, suggesting that aa 11 and 129 were not relevant to PX localization in cells. However, mutation of A11T, A129T or both A11/129T remarkably reduced apoptosis compared to that of PX-WT control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f005">Figure 5</xref>c,d). These results indicate that A11 and 129 are critical amino acids responsible for PX-induced apoptosis, revealing PX as a potential virulence factor for the pathogenic strains of FAdV4.
