<p>In this study, we found that infection of LMH cells by FAdV4 induced apoptosis in LMH cells. By screening for viral components involved in FAdV4-induced apoptosis, we identified PX as a major viral protein inducing apoptosis in host cells. Furthermore, nuclear translocation of PX is required for PX-induced apoptosis, and alanines 11 and 129 of PX are crucial to PX-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase-3 activity by inhibitors suppressed FAdV4 growth in LMH cells.</p>
