<p>Adenoviruses are widely-distributed microbes across the globe, and can infect varied species of vertebrates, including birds, animals and humans. Fowl adenoviruses, belonging to the

 <italic>Adenoviridae</italic> family, can be divided into 12 serotypes, including FAdV1-7, FAdV8a/b, and FAdV9-12. Fowl Adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV4), mainly infects 3- to 6-week old broilers [

Hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) was observed in the diseased chickens with FAdV4 infection clinically characterized by swollen livers with focal necroses and petechial hemorrhages, as well as enlarged pericardial sacs containing clear and yellowish fluids. Recently, FAdV4 has caused numerous outbreaks of HHS in chickens in China, leading to severe economic losses to the stakeholders.
