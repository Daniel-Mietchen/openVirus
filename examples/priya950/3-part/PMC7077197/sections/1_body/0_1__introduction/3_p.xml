<p>In comparison with avian adenoviruses, human adenoviruses are very well studied and have been usually used as vectors for gene-therapeutic research [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The early genes of human adenoviruses are involved in host-pathogen interactions, including cell cycle progression, host antiviral response, apoptosis and activation of the late promoter for late gene expression [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Gam-1, an early gene of adenovirus, disrupts PML, whose antiviral function is p53-independent or dependent [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, FAdV1 Gam-1 inhibits TNF-alpha induced apoptosis through the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway in Dark cell lines [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It was found that human adenovirus protein X (PX), also named Mu, modulates expression of E2 proteins [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and is involved in taking the linear double-stranded DNA genome to the capsid during viral replication [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but the role of Fowl adenovirus PX is largely unknown. A recent report indicates that the FAdV4 isolate caused liver injury largely through apoptosis, autophagy and a severe inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the pathogenesis of FAdV4 infection is still not clear.
