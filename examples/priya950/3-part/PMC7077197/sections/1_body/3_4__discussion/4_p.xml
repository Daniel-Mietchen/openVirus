<p>Adenovirus assembly takes place in the nucleus of the infected cell [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The capsid proteins surrounding the genome DNA must be transported into the nucleus of a host cell to complete the assembly. The 100K-chaperone protein of adenovirus assists the nuclear localization and folding of the hexon protein and acts as a scaffold to facilitate assembly of the hexon trimer [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The penton capsomers consisting of a pentameric penton base and trimeric fiber assemble in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus for virion assembly [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Both nuclear localization sequences (NLS), the primary amino acid motifs, even secondary or tertiary structural elements in many proteins or RNAs, and the chaperones were fully recognized as the nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism using specific cellular factors or macromolecular complexes to regulate trafficking of cargoes [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. CCT7, a cytosolic chaperone protein, was determined to interact with Hexon of FAdV4 and was required for viral replication [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but the effects of CCT7 on Hexon localization remain unknown. Interestingly, we found that both viral PX of FAdV4 and FLAG-PX recombinants expressed in LMH cells were localized in the nucleus and the R/K regions in amino acid residues of 14 to 16 and of 22 to 25 of PX were crucial to the nuclear translocation of these PXs. Furthermore, our data indicate that the nuclear translocation of PX is required for PX-induced apoptosis in cells. It seems that localization of PX in the nucleus is a must for PX-induced apoptosis in host cells.
