<p>In summary, our data show that FAdV4 infection-induced apoptosis in LMH cells and PX acts as a major viral factor inducing apoptosis in host cells. Furthermore, nuclear translocation of PX is required for PX-induced apoptosis, and alanines 11 and 129 of PX are crucial to PX-induced apoptosis. Moreover, FAdV4-induced apoptosis facilitates viral replication, suggesting that PX serves as a virulence factor for FAdV4 infection, which may provide a new clue to the design of a novel vaccine for the control of FAdV4 infection.</p>
