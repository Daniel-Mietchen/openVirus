<p>It was reported that FAdV4 induced liver injury through apoptosis, autophagy, and an acute inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism underlying FAdV4-induced apoptosis is unclear. The genome of FAdV4 potentially contains 46 ORFs encoding proteins as determined by the BD-based Gene Identification tool [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this study, we cloned all 11 proteins existing in the mature capsid with reference to the previous publications [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Leghorn Male Hepatocellular (LMH) cells are an immortalized chicken hepatic cell line that is typically used for FAdV4 infection and replication, and importantly notable cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in FAdV4-infected LMH cells. In this study, our data first show that FAdV4 infection caused marked apoptosis in LMH cells. Second, the expressions of viral proteins in LMH cells indicate that PX was a major factor causing apoptosis in cells. Of note, the expression levels of different recombinant proteins in transfected cells may vary due to some unknown reasons although the doses of plasmids are equally transfected in the assay. In this study, we observed that the expressions of Hexon, pTP and pVI were lower than that of the others, which might affect their apoptotic activity. However, we found that the transfection of cells with increasing doses of these plasmids did not change the conclusion. We used this method to screen for apoptosis-inducing viral proteins as candidates in the beginning, but these candidate proteins must be further examined for their apoptotic activities using different methods. We found that the PX expression level in cells transfected with pRK5-FLAG-pX was approximately equivalent to that of viral PX in cells infected with FAdV4 at a MOI of 1 or 10 (

Importantly, the apoptosis-inducing effect of PX strictly depends on its localization in the nucleus as well as A11 and A129 of PX. Furthermore, FAdV4-induced apoptosis facilitates viral replication. These results suggest that PX may serve as a virulence factor for pathogenic FAdV4 strains.
