<p>Leghorn male hepatocellular cells (LMH cells), from an immortalized chicken liver cell line, were kindly provided by Dr. Jinhua Liu (CAU, Beijing, China). The LMH cells were cultured in Waymouth’s Medium (MACGENE Technology, Beijing, China) supplemented with 1 × Penicillin-Streptomycin (MACGENE Technology) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NE, USA) in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. The cell culture plates were coated with 0.1% gelatin solution (Cat. ES-006-B, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) with an addition of 2 mL, and incubated at 4 °C for 5 to 10 minutes before use.
