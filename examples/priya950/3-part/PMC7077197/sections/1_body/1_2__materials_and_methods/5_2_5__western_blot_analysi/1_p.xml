<p>LMH cells (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) were seeded on 12-well plates and cultured for 12 h, followed by infection with FAdV4 or transfection with indicated plasmids (1 μg per well). Twenty-four or forty-eight hours after treatment, cell lysates were prepared with a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% TritonX-100, 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 × completed cocktail protease inhibitor). The sample was boiled with 1 × SDS loading buffer for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. After blocking with 5% skimmed milk, the membranes were incubated with the indicated antibodies. Blots were developed using an ECL kit (Kangwei Biological Company, Suzhou, China).
