Recent studies show that FAdV4 induces liver injury through apoptosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. We report here that FAdV4 infection caused apoptosis in Leghorn male hepatocellular (LMH) cells and that PX, a structural protein of FAdV4, acted as a major viral factor inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, the nuclear localization of PX is determined by the R/K regions of PX and required for PX-induced apoptosis. Moreover, alanines 11 and 129 of PX are crucial to PX-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of FAdV4-induced apoptosis by caspase inhibitors retarded viral replication, suggesting that PX serves as a virulence factor for FAdV4 infection, which may further our understandings of the pathogenesis of FAdV4 infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>FAdV4</kwd><kwd>PX</kwd><kwd>nuclear localization</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>viral replication</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-12-00228"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Adenoviruses are widely-distributed microbes across the globe, and can infect varied species of vertebrates, including birds, animals and humans. Fowl adenoviruses, belonging to the <italic>Aviadenovirus</italic> genus in the <italic>Adenoviridae</italic> family, can be divided into 12 serotypes, including FAdV1-7, FAdV8a/b, and FAdV9-12. Fowl Adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV4), mainly infects 3- to 6-week old broilers [<xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) was observed in the diseased chickens with FAdV4 infection clinically characterized by swollen livers with focal necroses and petechial hemorrhages, as well as enlarged pericardial sacs containing clear and yellowish fluids. Recently, FAdV4 has caused numerous outbreaks of HHS in chickens in China, leading to severe economic losses to the stakeholders.</p><p>FAdV4 is a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus, and its genome, 43.7 kb, encodes approximately 11 structural proteins and 32 non-structural proteins [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently, there are few reports available regarding the pathogenesis of FAdV4. It was found that Hexon and Fiber 2 genes of FAdV4 HNJZ strain (GenBank ID: KU558760.1) were closely associated with the virulence of the virus [<xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Interestingly, the FAdV4 strains that recently emerged in China had the same deletion of 1966 bp in the genome compared with the non-virulent FAdV4 viruses (ON1 strain) [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the experimental evidence shows that the natural deficiency of 1966 bp in the viral genome was not essential for the increased virulence of the recently isolated FAdV4 in China [<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Currently, the virulence-associated factors of FAdV4 responsible for clinical HHS are still unknown.</p><p>In comparison with avian adenoviruses, human adenoviruses are very well studied and have been usually used as vectors for gene-therapeutic research [<xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The early genes of human adenoviruses are involved in host-pathogen interactions, including cell cycle progression, host antiviral response, apoptosis and activation of the late promoter for late gene expression [<xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Gam-1, an early gene of adenovirus, disrupts PML, whose antiviral function is p53-independent or dependent [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, FAdV1 Gam-1 inhibits TNF-alpha induced apoptosis through the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway in Dark cell lines [<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It was found that human adenovirus protein X (PX), also named Mu, modulates expression of E2 proteins [<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and is involved in taking the linear double-stranded DNA genome to the capsid during viral replication [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but the role of Fowl adenovirus PX is largely unknown. A recent report indicates that the FAdV4 isolate caused liver injury largely through apoptosis, autophagy and a severe inflammatory response [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the pathogenesis of FAdV4 infection is still not clear.</p><p>In this study, we found that infection of LMH cells by FAdV4 induced apoptosis in LMH cells. By screening for viral components involved in FAdV4-induced apoptosis, we identified PX as a major viral protein inducing apoptosis in host cells. Furthermore, nuclear translocation of PX is required for PX-induced apoptosis, and alanines 11 and 129 of PX are crucial to PX-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase-3 activity by inhibitors suppressed FAdV4 growth in LMH cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-12-00228"><title>2.

Results</title><sec id="sec3dot1-viruses-12-00228"><title>3.1. FAdV4 Induced Apoptosis in LMH Cells</title><p>To investigate the pathogenesis of FAdV4 infection, we infected Leghorn Male Hepatocellular (LMH) cells, an immortalized chicken liver cell line, with FAdV4, and examined the cytopathic effects (CPE) in virus-infected cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f001">Figure 1</xref>a, FAdV4 infection caused severe CPEs in LMH cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the increase of CPE was correlated with the viral growth in host cells, as shown by increased expressions of hexon, a viral structural protein of FAdV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). To further analyze the cell biological features associated with FAdV4-induced CPE in LMH cells, samples stained for Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD were analyzed by flow cytometry. As a result, the number of Annexin V-positive cells markedly increased 48 h after FAdV4 infection compared to that of mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f001">Figure 1</xref>c,d), and similar results were obtained for Annexin V and 7-AAD double positive cells. Furthermore, the number of Annexin V-positive cells could be markedly reduced by caspase inhibitors (z-VAD-fmk, pan-caspase inhibitor; z-DEVD-fmk, caspase-3 inhibitor and z-IETD-fmk, caspase-8 inhibitor) except z-LEHD-fmk, the caspase-9 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f001">Figure 1</xref>e,f). These results demonstrate that infection of LMH cells with FAdV4 induced apoptosis in host cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-12-00228"><title>3.2. The PX Protein Plays a Major Role in FAdV4-Induced Apoptosis in LMH Cells</title><p>As FAdV4 infection caused apoptosis in LMH cells, we proposed that one or more components of FAdV4 were responsible for FAdV4-induced cell death. To test this hypothesis, we cloned the genes (<italic>hexon</italic>, <italic>fiber 1</italic>, <italic>fiber 2</italic>, <italic>pIIIa</italic>, <italic>IVa2</italic>, <italic>pTP</italic>, <italic>pVI</italic>, <italic>pVII</italic>, <italic>pVIII</italic>, <italic>pX</italic> and <italic>penton base</italic>) encoding the indicated proteins of FAdV4 and made a FLAG fusion for each of these indicated proteins and expressed them in LMH cells by transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b). Forty-eight hours after transfection, all 11 fusion proteins could be detected in LMH cells. Interestingly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f002">Figure 2</xref>c,d, the number of Annexin V-positive cells significantly increased 48 hours post-transfection with pRK5-FLAG-pX compared to that of controls (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Furthermore, the number of Annexin V-positive cells with pRK5-FLAG-pX transfection could be markedly reduced by caspase inhibitors (z-VAD-fmk, z-DEVD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk) but not by z-LETD-fmk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f002">Figure 2</xref>e,f). These results indicate that FAdV4 PX is the major viral component responsible for FAdV4-induced apoptosis in LMH cells. To rule out the possibility that the expression of viral protein in cells by transfection may cause artifacts due to the quantity of overexpressed proteins above physiological levels, we compared the quantity of viral PX in FAdV4-infected cells with that of pRK5-FLAG-pX-transfected controls using a Western Blot assay. As a result, the PX expression level in cells transfected with pRK5-FLAG-pX was approximately equivalent to that of viral PX in cells infected with FAdV4 at an MOI of 1 or 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f002">Figure 2</xref>g). These data suggest that FAdV4 PX serves as a major apoptosis-inducer during FAdV4 infection in LMH cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-12-00228"><title>3.3. Localization of PX Protein in the Nucleus is Required for PX-Induced Apoptosis</title><p>As FAdV4 PX plays a major role in FAdV4-induced apoptosis, we attempted to find out the localization of PX in FAdV4-infected cells or cells transfected with pRK5-FLAG-pX using an immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f003">Figure 3</xref>a, PX was localized in the nucleus of cells with both FAdV4 infection and pRK5-FLAG-pX transfection, which prompted us to propose that the nuclear localization of PX might be necessary for PX-induced apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a series of PX deletion mutants fused to the FLAG tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). We expressed these PX deletion mutants (from &#x00394;1 to &#x00394;6) and controls in LMH cells and examined the subcellular localization of these deletion mutants as well as apoptosis in these transfected cells. As a result, PX mutant &#x00394;1(1-150 amino acids), similar to the full-length PX, was merely localized in the nucleus, while mutants &#x00394;2 and &#x00394;3 were distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In comparison, PX mutants (&#x00394;4-&#x00394;6) were largely accumulated in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f003">Figure 3</xref>c), suggesting that the domains of amino acids 1-30 and 120-150 were associated with the distribution of PX. Interestingly, PX mutant &#x00394;1 retained most of the apoptosis-inducing ability of PX. In comparison, the apoptosis induced by PX mutants &#x00394;2-&#x00394;4 markedly decreased, and little apoptosis was observed in cells with PX mutants &#x00394;5 or &#x00394;6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f003">Figure 3</xref>d,e). These data suggest that apoptosis induced by PX and its mutants is associated with their nuclear localization.</p><p>Since PX mutant lacking residues 1&#x02013;30 amino acids was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, it was intriguing to determine whether the 1&#x02013;30 amino acids of PX contained nuclear localization sequence (NLS). Therefore, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of PX online (<uri xlink:href="https://www.genscript.com/psort.html">https://www.genscript.com/psort.html</uri>). As a result, it was predicted that the domain of 14&#x02013;25 amino acids was rich with arginines and lysines, suggesting that this domain might be associated with nuclear localization [<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To confirm the prediction, we replaced critical arginine and lysine residues on both sides of FSTKQ with alanines as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, and the resulting mutants were named PX-nls1m, PX-nls2m, and PX-nls1/2m, respectively. We transfected LMH cells with these pRK5-FLAG-pX mutants and observed the distribution of PX mutant proteins in cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, both PX-nls1m and PX-nls2m mutants were more or less localized in the cytoplasm of transfected cells compared to that of PX-wt controls. In contrast, the PX-nls1/2m mutant was largely localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that the domains containing arginine and lysine residues on both sides of FSTKQ were required for PX nuclear translocation. Concurrently, inhibition of PX from nuclear translocation by mutating the nuclear translocation domains could significantly suppress the PX-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f004">Figure 4</xref>c,d), further establishing that localization of PX in the nucleus is required for PX-induced apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-12-00228"><title>3.4. Amino Acids 11 and 129 Alanines of PX Are Crucial to PX-Induced Apoptosis</title><p>It was reported that the FAdV4 ON1 strain is an isolate from Canada, and this strain is even in the clustering of ON1 strains that were closer to FAdV4 as determined by phylogenetic analysis, while the chicken infected with ON1 strain showed no clinical signs of inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) or inclusion body hepatitis/hydropericardium syndrome (IBH/HPS) [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As PX acts as a major factor responsible for FAdV4-induced apoptosis, we performed the amino acid sequence alignment of ON1 strain PX with that of the virulent FAdV4 strains (including the HuBWH strain, isolated from diseased chickens with IBH by our laboratory) that caused IBH outbreaks in chickens in China. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f005">Figure 5</xref>a, there are only two amino acid differences in PX of the ON1 strain (11 and 129 Threonines) compared with that of virulent FAdV4 strains (11 and 129 alanines) in China. Thus, we proposed that the two sites of FAdV4 PX (aa 11 and 129) might be critical to PX-induced apoptosis and that mutations of aa 11 and 129 would, therefore, reduce PX-induced apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we made mutant constructs pRK5-FLAG-pX-A11T, pRK5-FLAG-pX-A129T, and pRK5-FLAG-pX-A11/129T, transfected these vectors into LMH cells respectively, and examined the localization of these mutants and apoptosis in the transfected cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f005">Figure 5</xref>b, FLAG-pX-WT and all PX mutants were localized in the nucleus, suggesting that aa 11 and 129 were not relevant to PX localization in cells. However, mutation of A11T, A129T or both A11/129T remarkably reduced apoptosis compared to that of PX-WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f005">Figure 5</xref>c,d). These results indicate that A11 and 129 are critical amino acids responsible for PX-induced apoptosis, revealing PX as a potential virulence factor for the pathogenic strains of FAdV4.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-12-00228"><title>3.5. Inhibition of FAdV4-Induced Apoptosis by Inhibitors Restricted Viral Replication</title><p>Apoptosis is generally considered as a defense mechanism of host cells in response to pathogenic infection. However, some viruses might take advantage of apoptosis for its spread [<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It would be intriguing to determine whether FAdV4-induced apoptosis is beneficial to viral replication. We treated LMH cells with z-DEVD-fmk, caspase-3 inhibitors inhibiting apoptosis, and examined viral replication at different time points (12, 24, 36 and 48h) post-infection. As a result, the treatment of cells with z-DEVD-fmk markedly reduced viral loads in both cell cultures and the supernatants compared to that of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,b), suggesting that apoptosis induced by FAdV4 infection facilitated viral replication.</p><p>Taken together, our data show that FAdV4 infection-induced apoptosis in LMH cells, and PX, a structural protein of FAdV4, acts as a major viral factor inducing apoptosis in LMH cells. Furthermore, nuclear translocation of PX is required for PX-induced apoptosis, and aa11 and 129 are crucial to PX-induced apoptosis. Moreover, FAdV4-induced apoptosis facilitates viral replication, suggesting that PX may serve as a virulence factor for FAdV4 infection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-12-00228"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Hydropericardium-Hepatitis Syndrome (HHS) was initially supposed to be caused by nutritional deficiency or toxicity [<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It was not until 1989 that adenovirus was firstly identified from a purified liver homogenate [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The epidemics in the past two decades have provided some evidence confirming that the fowl adenovirus causing HHS worldwide were identified as serotypes 4 and 10 [<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition to 3-5-week-old broilers, other avian species, including hens, ducks, pigeons, and quails, could also be infected by FAdV on some occasions [<xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The mortality of this disease could reach up to 80% of susceptible chickens in China [<xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, HHS remains a severe threat to the stakeholders.</p><p>It was reported that FAdV4 induced liver injury through apoptosis, autophagy, and an acute inflammatory response [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism underlying FAdV4-induced apoptosis is unclear. The genome of FAdV4 potentially contains 46 ORFs encoding proteins as determined by the BD-based Gene Identification tool [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this study, we cloned all 11 proteins existing in the mature capsid with reference to the previous publications [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Leghorn Male Hepatocellular (LMH) cells are an immortalized chicken hepatic cell line that is typically used for FAdV4 infection and replication, and importantly notable cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in FAdV4-infected LMH cells. In this study, our data first show that FAdV4 infection caused marked apoptosis in LMH cells. Second, the expressions of viral proteins in LMH cells indicate that PX was a major factor causing apoptosis in cells. Of note, the expression levels of different recombinant proteins in transfected cells may vary due to some unknown reasons although the doses of plasmids are equally transfected in the assay. In this study, we observed that the expressions of Hexon, pTP and pVI were lower than that of the others, which might affect their apoptotic activity. However, we found that the transfection of cells with increasing doses of these plasmids did not change the conclusion. We used this method to screen for apoptosis-inducing viral proteins as candidates in the beginning, but these candidate proteins must be further examined for their apoptotic activities using different methods. We found that the PX expression level in cells transfected with pRK5-FLAG-pX was approximately equivalent to that of viral PX in cells infected with FAdV4 at a MOI of 1 or 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f002">Figure 2</xref>g). Importantly, the apoptosis-inducing effect of PX strictly depends on its localization in the nucleus as well as A11 and A129 of PX. Furthermore, FAdV4-induced apoptosis facilitates viral replication. These results suggest that PX may serve as a virulence factor for pathogenic FAdV4 strains.</p><p>In human adenovirus (HAd), PX, also known as Mu, modulates the expression of E2 protein [<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and plays an important role in attaching the linear double-stranded DNA genome to the capsid during replication [<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the low homology (34.2%) of the PX amino acid sequence between HAd2/5 (GenBank ID: AC_000007.1/AC_000008.1) and FAdV4 (GenBank ID: NC_015323.1) indicates that the function of FAdV4 PX may vary from that of HAd. Our data indicate, for the first time, FAdV4 PX as a major viral protein inducing apoptosis in host cells, which may serve as a virulence factor for pathogenic FAdV4. In addition to PX, other structural proteins of FAdV4, such as Hexon and Fiber 2, were found to be the crucial factors determining the pathogenicity of FAdV4 [<xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It was reported that Hexon or Fiber2 of FAdV4 HNJZ strain caused apoptosis to more or less degree. Our data show that FAdV4 PX induced much greater apoptosis in LMH cells than Hexon or Fiber2.</p><p>Adenovirus assembly takes place in the nucleus of the infected cell [<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The capsid proteins surrounding the genome DNA must be transported into the nucleus of a host cell to complete the assembly. The 100K-chaperone protein of adenovirus assists the nuclear localization and folding of the hexon protein and acts as a scaffold to facilitate assembly of the hexon trimer [<xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The penton capsomers consisting of a pentameric penton base and trimeric fiber assemble in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus for virion assembly [<xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Both nuclear localization sequences (NLS), the primary amino acid motifs, even secondary or tertiary structural elements in many proteins or RNAs, and the chaperones were fully recognized as the nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism using specific cellular factors or macromolecular complexes to regulate trafficking of cargoes [<xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. CCT7, a cytosolic chaperone protein, was determined to interact with Hexon of FAdV4 and was required for viral replication [<xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but the effects of CCT7 on Hexon localization remain unknown. Interestingly, we found that both viral PX of FAdV4 and FLAG-PX recombinants expressed in LMH cells were localized in the nucleus and the R/K regions in amino acid residues of 14 to 16 and of 22 to 25 of PX were crucial to the nuclear translocation of these PXs. Furthermore, our data indicate that the nuclear translocation of PX is required for PX-induced apoptosis in cells. It seems that localization of PX in the nucleus is a must for PX-induced apoptosis in host cells.</p><p>In recent years, several virulent FAdV4 strains were isolated and identified, including HNJZ, SDDZ (GenBank ID: KU558761.1), SXCZ (GenBank ID: KU558762.1), AHBZ (GenBank ID: KU569295.1), JSXZ (GenBank ID: KU569296.1) and HuBWH in China [<xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These virulent FAdV4 strains had an identical amino acid sequence of PX. Interestingly, we found that all these Chinese FAdV4 stains had the same spontaneous amino acid substitutions at residues 11 (T to A) and 129 (T to A) in the PX protein when compared with non-pathogenic FAdV4 ON1 strain. Surprisingly, mutation of A11T, A129T or both A11/129T back, referring the PX sequence of non-pathogenic FAdV4 ON1 dramatically reduced apoptosis compared to that of virulent FAdV4 PX, indicating that aa 11 and 129 alanines are critical for PX-induced apoptosis. It seems that PX may serve as a virulence factor for pathogenic FAdV4 isolates because inhibition of apoptosis by caspase inhibitors significantly reduced the viral growth in LMH cells. Thus PX-induced apoptosis contributed at least in part to FAdV4-induced apoptosis, which facilitates viral replication. Up to now, some researchers have established a reverse genetic system to generate recombinant FAdV4 [<xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or used the CRISPR/cas9 system to delete or insert some nucleotide fragments directly [<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, more efforts will be required to investigate the role of PX in the pathogenesis of FAdV4 infection.</p><p>In summary, our data show that FAdV4 infection-induced apoptosis in LMH cells and PX acts as a major viral factor inducing apoptosis in host cells. Furthermore, nuclear translocation of PX is required for PX-induced apoptosis, and alanines 11 and 129 of PX are crucial to PX-induced apoptosis. Moreover, FAdV4-induced apoptosis facilitates viral replication, suggesting that PX serves as a virulence factor for FAdV4 infection, which may provide a new clue to the design of a novel vaccine for the control of FAdV4 infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Jinhua Liu for his kind assistance.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, S.J.Z.; Data curation, M.Z.; Formal analysis, M.Z. and S.J.Z.; Funding acquisition, X.L. and S.J.Z.; Investigation, M.Z.; Methodology, M.Z. and S.J.Z.; Project administration, X.L. and S.J.Z.; Resources, X.D., A.H., Y.W., L.G., and H.C.; Supervision, S.J.Z.; Validation, M.Z.; Visualization, M.Z.; Writing &#x02013; original draft, M.Z.; Writing &#x02013; review and editing, S.J.Z.
