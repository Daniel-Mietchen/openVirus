<p>Thus, infection with the NSs-expressing wt LACV converted the nuclear Elongin C speckles in a manner that was unique and clearly distinct from α-amanitin. The subcellular distribution of elongin A and B, in contrast, remained unchanged by infection, although α-amanitin had an influence on Elongin A distribution. From the different phenotypes of infection and α-amanitin we conclude that the redistribution of Elongin C is specific for LACV NSs and not simply a consequence of its ability to block RNAP II.</p>
