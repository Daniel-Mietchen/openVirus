<p>Using immunofluorescence analysis, we sought to observe the behavior of the Elongins in LACV-infected cells. To better distinguish between primary effects caused by NSs and possible secondary effects caused by the NSs-mediated RPB1 degradation and block in host mRNA transcription, we treated the HuH-7 cells in parallel with the RNAP II inhibitor α-amanitin. In the immunofluorescence experiments, Elongin A exhibited in uninfected cells a nuclear signal with the tendency to form speckles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The nuclear pattern did not change in infected cells (MOI of 1), independent of whether it was wt LACV or LACVdelNSs. The Elongin A speckles, however, diminished in signal strength and number when α-amanitin was applied. Elongin B produced a nuclear immunofluorescence signal that did not change by any of the treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Elongin C also exhibited a nuclear speckle pattern in uninfected cells and in cells infected with the LACVdelNSs virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In cells infected with wt LACV, however, the speckles were barely visible, whereas under α-amanitin treatment the speckles dissolved but the signal remained nuclear. Since on the other hand protein levels of all Elongins remained unchanged under infection (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), the diminished Elongin C signal in wt LACV-infected cells apparently derived from a relocalization and dilution throughout the cell.
