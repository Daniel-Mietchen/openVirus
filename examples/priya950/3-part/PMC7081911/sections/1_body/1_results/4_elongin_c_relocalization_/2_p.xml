<p>NSs seems to specifically disassemble the nucleolar Elongin C speckles without entirely destroying the structural integrity of the nucleoli. Since under NSs on one hand Elongin C becomes undetectable in immunofluorescence but, on the other hand, the levels on immunoblots remain unchanged, we investigated the possibility of a redistribution to the cytoplasm. Leptomycin B (LMB) is an inhibitor of CRM1/exportin 1, the major nuclear export factor for proteins. Using LMB, we could indeed trap Elongin C in the nucleoli of HuH-7 cells infected with wt LACV at an MOI of 1 (although the signal was somewhat weaker than in mock infection) (

Nonetheless, immunoblots of HuH-7 cells infected with viruses at an MOI of 10 show that blocking nuclear export by LMB could not relieve the destruction of RPB1 by NSs, in contrast to the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (
