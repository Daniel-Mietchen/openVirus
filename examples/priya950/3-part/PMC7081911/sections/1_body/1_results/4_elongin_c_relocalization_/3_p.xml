<p>LMB had no impact on wt LACV titers (data not shown) or the N protein expression (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). Thus, NSs removes Elongin C from the nucleus in a Crm1-dependent manner, but this mechanism seems a secondary phenomenon rather than an essential step in the attack of RNAP II. Altogether, our data show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit Elongin C is involved in the NSs-mediated destruction of the RNAP II large subunit RPB1 and the suppression of IFN induction, and gets relocalized as a consequence.
