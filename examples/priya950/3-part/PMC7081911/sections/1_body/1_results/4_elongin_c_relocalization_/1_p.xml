<p>The subnuclear distribution pattern of Elongin C in uninfected cells is reminiscent of nucleoli, the sites of rRNA synthesis by RNAP I and ribosome biogenesis (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Indeed, using nucleolin as marker, we detected a clear and 1:1 overlap with the Elongin C signal in HuH-7 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Both nucleolin and Elongin C remained unchanged in LACVdelNSs-infected cells but became evenly distributed in the nucleus upon Î±-amanitin treatment. wt LACV-infected cells (MOI of 1) exhibited an intermediate phenotype of nucleolin distribution, with still distinguishable but weaker nucleolar speckles, whereas the Elongin C signal became undetectable, as shown above. These results are in line with our previous results showing that LACV NSs impedes neither RNAP I transcription nor nucleolar localization of RNAP I transcripts (
