<p>Previously, we demonstrated the degradation of the hyperphosphorylated RNAP IIo by NS-expressing wt LACV in a time course experiment that started at 5 h postinfection (p.i.) (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Meanwhile, however, it has become clear that the host cell elicits IFN induction even earlier, upon detection of the nucleocapsid-borne double-stranded RNA panhandle by RIG-I immediately after virus entry (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Moreover, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses demonstrated that mRNA transcription by LACV is detectable as early as 1 h p.i. (data not shown). To address this immediate early step of infection, we conducted a time course experiment in human HuH-7 cells (infected at a multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 10) that covered 1 to 4 h p.i. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that even at 1 h p.i. there is a reduced RPB1 IIo signal in wild-type (wt) LACV-infected cells, whereas infection with an NSs-deleted LACV (LACVdelNSs) had no such effect. These differences in RPB1 IIo levels are not due to potential differences in viral replication, as demonstrated by comparisons of the immunoblot signal quantifications for RPB1 IIo and LACV N at 3 and 4 h p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref>). Curiously, the phosphorylation states of either RPB1 CTD-serine 2 or 5 are not severely diminished at these time points (in contrast to longer infections [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]), probably due to short-term activation under infection, as seen for the delNSs virus. Interestingly, the application of α-amanitin, a pharmaceutical transcription inhibitor known to induce RPB1 degradation (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), showed a slightly reduced effect than wt LACV. α-Amanitin was given at the same time as the virus, but unlike NSs, which first has to be expressed, the full inhibitor dose is present right from the start. Similar results were obtained with the global inhibitor of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, actinomycin D (data not shown). The finding that LACV NSs is on a par with a chemical RNAP II inhibitor underscores the surprisingly fast and efficient destruction of RPB1 by LACV NSs.
