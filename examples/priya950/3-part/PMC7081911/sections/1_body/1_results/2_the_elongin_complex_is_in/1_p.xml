<p>The phenotype of RNAP II degradation by LACV NSs resembles the one occurring after DNA damage (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). When RNAP II translocation on DNA is stalled by genotoxic damages or chemical inhibitors such as α-amanitin (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), the RPB1 subunit becomes ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). The Elongin E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, consisting of the subunits Elongin A, B, and C, was shown to be involved in degradative polyubiquitination of mammalian RPB1 (

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). In undamaged cells, however, Elongin A/B/C promotes RNAP II transcription (hence its name) by decreasing transient RNAP II pausing (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). We investigated a possible involvement of the Elongin complex in NSs action. First of all, we knocked down mRNAs of the individual Elongins and monitored the effect under LACV infection. Human A459 cells were transfected with siRNA against Elongin A, B, or C; infected with wt LACV or LACVdelNSs (MOI of 10); and then lysed and immunoblotted 16 h later. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> demonstrates that the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were strongly reducing the individual protein levels and that Elongins B and C seem to stabilize each other, since the knockdown of either of these reduced levels of the other one. However, quantification of the immunoblot signals show that Elongin C is most reduced when knocked down by specific siRNA, whereas under conditions of Elongin B knockdown residual amounts of Elongin C remain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Regarding RNAP, the levels of the IIo fraction are still largely suppressed by LACV infection when Elongins were depleted by siRNAs (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, quantification and statistics of the immunoblot signals revealed that RPB1 IIo levels partially recovered under conditions of Elongin C knockdown (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Elongin A or B knockdown, in contrast, had no such effect.
