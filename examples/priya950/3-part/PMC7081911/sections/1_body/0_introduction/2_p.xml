<p>The group of orthobunyaviruses is taxonomically defined as a genus within the family 
 <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The pleomorphic virions are enveloped and have a diameter of approximately 100 nm. As is typical for bunyaviruses (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), their genome consists of three segments of negative-strand RNA that are named L (large; ca. 7,000 nucleotides [nt]), M (medium; ca. 4,500 nt), and S (small; ca 950 nt). The L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), the M segments encodes a polyprotein that is processed to the envelope glycoproteins Gn, NSm (nonstructural, M segment), and Gc, and the S segments encodes the nucleocapsid protein N and the nonstructural protein NSs. All genomic segments are encapsidated by N protein and contain noncoding regions at their 5′ and 3′ ends that have the potential to anneal to a so-called “panhandle structure” due to partial sequence complementarities. The panhandle sequences are bound by the L RdRP and constitute the promoter for viral mRNA transcription and genome replication (
