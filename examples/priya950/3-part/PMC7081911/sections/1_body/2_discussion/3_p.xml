<p>Our attempts to robustly demonstrate a direct interaction between LACV NSs and Elongin C in transfected cells have failed (data not shown), in line with the absence of Elongin C in the LACV NSs interactome (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Moreover, LACV NSs does not exhibit a discernible nucleolar localization but is faintly distributed all over the nucleus (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and the nucleolar localization sequence detected for SBV NSs is not conserved in LACV NSs (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Thus, the effect of NSs on Elongin C in the nucleoli is most likely transient or indirect. Also, the relocation of Elongin C might be a secondary effect and not causative, since nuclear export inhibition by LMB partially prevented Elongin C redistribution but not RPB1 degradation by NSs. We therefore hypothesize that LACV NSs recruits an Elongin C-dependent host cell pathway that leads to RPB1 degradation and inhibition of host mRNA transcription. The relocalization of Elongin C is a morphological consequence of this process (but NSs specific, since RNAP II inhibition by Î±-amanitin has a different phenotype), but it is not necessarily causative. Why Elongin A and B seem less important remains unclear. A slight but statistically significant rescue of RNAP II transcription activity was, however, measurable also in those knockdowns.
