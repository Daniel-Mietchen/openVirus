<p>Despite the significant impact of the Elongin C knockdown, it was not sufficient to entirely rescue RNAP II and IFN induction from NSs-mediated destruction and blockade. This is comparable to the observation with RVFV NSs and its cellular cofactor, the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXO3. Similar to the situation with LACV NSs and Elongin C, IFN induction by wt RVFV is rescued by one log
 <sub>10</sub> step in cells depleted of FBXO3, but an NSs-deleted virus mutant still induced IFN-Î² by another log
 <sub>10</sub> step (

RVFV NSs is known to counteract IFN induction by several mechanisms, namely, (i) sequestration of subunits p44 and XPB of the general RNAP II transcription factor TFIIH, (ii) destruction of the TFIIH subunit p62 (mediated by mentioned FBXO3), and (iii) recruitment of the IFN promoter suppressor SAP30 (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that LACV NSs, despite having approximately just one-third the size of RVFV NSs, has similarly evolved several independent mechanisms to destroy RNAP II and suppress IFN induction and that the Elongin C-dependent branch is just one of them. Removing Elongin C can help to uncover these additional anti-IFN strategies which may contribute to the degradation of RPB1 and breakdown of RNAP II activity, which is even faster than for RVFV NSs.
