<p>The cellular Elongin complex consisting of Elongin A, B, and C is able to foster both the elongation of mRNA transcription by RNAP II (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) and (the B/C complex) the degradation of RPB1 under conditions of stress (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). These activities are congruent with the action of orthobunyavirus NSs, which targets exactly these activities, as it inhibits mRNA elongation and drives RPB1 degradation (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Moreover, the fact that mostly Elongin C participated in these NSs activities is in accord with our immunofluorescence data which show its relocalization by NSs but not that of Elongin A and B. Moreover, Elongin C was the only Elongin complex subunit that localizes to the nucleoli, which in turn are reorganized by orthobunyaviral NSs proteins (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>).
