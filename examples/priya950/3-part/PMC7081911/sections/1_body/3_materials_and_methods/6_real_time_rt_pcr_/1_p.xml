<p>Total cellular RNA was isolated with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, catalog no. 74104) eluted in 30 μl of sterile H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and 100 ng of RNA of each sample was used as a template. cDNA synthesis was random primed by using a QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen, catalog no. 205313). For PCR, a QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen catalog no. 204143l; random-primed cDNA) or SYBR Premix 
 <italic>Ex Taq</italic> (Tli RNase H Plus; TaKaRa catalog no. RR420A; strand-specific cDNA) was used. Primers were either purchased from Qiagen (IFN-β, QT00203763; IFIT1/ISG56, QT00201012; 18S RNA, QT00199367) or custom ordered for γ-actin intron 3 (forward, 5′-GCTGTTCCAGGCTCTGTTCC-3′; reverse, 5′-ATGCTCACACGCCACAACATGC-3′) (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>) and LACV S segment (forward, 5′-GGGTATATGGACTTCTGTG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCTTCCTCTCTGGCTTA-3′). The qPCR was carried out in a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). All values obtained were normalized against the 18S RNA signal by using the ΔΔ
