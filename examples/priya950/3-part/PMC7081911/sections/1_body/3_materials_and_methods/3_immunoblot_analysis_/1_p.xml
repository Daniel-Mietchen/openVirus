<p>After the cells were washed once with PBS, they were lysed in a 1:1 mixture of tissue protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific, catalog no. 78510) supplemented with phosphatase (Calbiochem, catalog no. 524625) and protease (Roche, catalog no. 4693116001) inhibitors and 2× sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris from a 0.5 M stock [pH 6.8], 25% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 0.01% bromophenol blue, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). The lysates were boiled for 10 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk powder in TBS-T and probed with primary antibodies against the following targets: RPB1/Pol II (N-20; Santa Cruz, catalog no. sc-899, 1:500, rabbit, polyclonal), RPB1 CTD-pSer 2/Ser2 α-CTD (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>; 1:2,000, mouse, polyclonal), Elongin A/TCEB3/SIII/p110 (110 kDa; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. HPA005910, 1:500, rabbit, polyclonal), Elongin B (18 kDa; Santa Cruz, sc-11447, 1:250, rabbit, polyclonal), Elongin C/SIII p15 (15 kDa; BD Transduction Laboratories, catalog no. 610761, 1:250, mouse, monoclonal), anti-β-tubulin (Abcam, ab6046, 1:1,000, rabbit, polyclonal), and anti-Flag (TM; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. F7425, 1:3200, rabbit, polyclonal). The secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher, catalog no. 31430, 1:40,000, goat, polyclonal), peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher, catalog no. 31460, 1:40,000, goat, polyclonal), and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog no. 712-036-150, 1:40,000, donkey, polyclonal). Western blot signals were detected on a Chemidoc (Bio-Rad) using SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Thermo Scientific, catalog no. 34096).
