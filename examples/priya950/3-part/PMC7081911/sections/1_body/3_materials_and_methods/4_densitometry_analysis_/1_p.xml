<p>Western blot signals were quantified using the Image Lab software provided with the Chemidoc machine (Bio-Rad). The intensities of the respective bands were measured using the volume tool, and the adjusted volume, accounting for the background, was used for each band. The bands of interest were first normalized to the loading control (Î²-tubulin) of the respective sample, and the normalized values were then compared to mock-treated samples of the same experiment. The graphs presented depict fold changes compared to mock-treated samples, with mock values set to 100%.</p>
