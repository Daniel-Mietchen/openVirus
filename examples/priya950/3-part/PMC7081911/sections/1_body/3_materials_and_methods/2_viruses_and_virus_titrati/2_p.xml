<p>Both LACV (BSL-2) and RVFV (BSL-3) were propagated on Vero 76 cells by infection at an MOI of 0.001 with the respective virus and cultivating the cells for 3 days. The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation, and the virus titer was determined by plaque test on CV-1 cells, using an Avicel overlay (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). After 3 days of incubation, the overlay was washed of using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cell layer was stained with staining solution (0.75% crystal violet, 3.75% formaldehyde, 20% ethanol, 1% methanol) for 10 min. The amount of virus was then calculated as PFU/ml.
