<p>Knockdowns of the indicated genes were performed twice by reverse transfection of siRNAs. All siRNAs were purchased from Qiagen: AllStar negative control siRNA (1027280), Elongin A (GeneSolution GS6924), Elongin B (GeneSolution GS6923), and Elongin C (GeneSolution GS6921). GeneSolution consists of four validated siRNAs against the respective transcript that were mixed in equimolar ratios with each other. A final concentration of 50 nM for each siRNA solution was reverse transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, catalog no. 13778075) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 4 h, the medium was changed, and the cells were incubated for 3 days. One day before the experiment, the cells were harvested and counted, and equal amounts of the cells were again reverse transfected as described above.</p>
