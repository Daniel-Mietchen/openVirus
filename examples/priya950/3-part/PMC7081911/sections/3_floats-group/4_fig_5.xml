  <p>Subcellular localization of Elongin A and B. HuH-7 cells were either mock infected, infected with wt LACV or LACVdelNSs (MOI of 1), or treated with α-amanitin (10 μg/ml) for 16 h. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then stained against endogenous Elongin A (A) or Elongin B (B) and LACV Gc protein; the nucleus was counterstained with DAPI.</p>
