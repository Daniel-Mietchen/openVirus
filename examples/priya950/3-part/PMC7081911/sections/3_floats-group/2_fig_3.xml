  <p>Elongin C and RPB1 degradation. A549 cells were transfected with siRNAs against the mRNAs for Elongin A, B, or C or a negative control (CTRL). (A to D) Cells were mock infected or infected with wt LACV or LACVdelNSs (MOI of 10) for 16 h. (A and B) The presence of RPB1, Elongin A/B/C, LACV N, or β-tubulin was monitored by immunoblotting (A), and the bands of Elongin C and RPB1 IIo were normalized to β-tubulin (B and C). (D) Amounts of γ-actin intron RNA were measured by RT-qPCR. (B to D) Means SD, and individual data points from five independent experiments, analyzed as described for
