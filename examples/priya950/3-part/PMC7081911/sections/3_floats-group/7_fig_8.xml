  <p>NSs-driven Elongin C redistribution and nuclear export. (A) Immunofluorescence analysis. HuH-7 cells were pretreated with LMB (16 nM) for 1 h and then infected with wt LACV (MOI of 1). Untreated and mock infection controls were done in parallel. At 16 h p.i., the cells were immunostained against Elongin C and LACV N, and the nucleus was counterstained with DAPI. (B) Immunoblot analysis. HuH-7 cells were pretreated with LMB as in panel A and then infected with wt LACV or LACVdel (MOI of 10) or treated with α-amanitin. After removal of the inoculum 1 h later, medium was added containing either MG132 (10 μM) or LMB (16 nM) or a combination of the two. Untreated and mock-infected controls were evaluated in parallel. At 8 h p.i., the samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antisera.</p>
