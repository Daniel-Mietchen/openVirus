  <p>Rapid and specific RPB1 degradation by wt LACV. HuH-7 cells were infected with wt LACV or LACVdelNSs viruses (MOI of 10) or treated with α-amanitin (10 μg/ml). (A) Immunoblot analyses for the various RPB1 states and for viral N at 1 to 4 h p.i., using the antibodies indicated on the left. Immunoblot signals of RPB1 IIo (B) and LACV N (C) were quantified and normalized to the tubulin signal. Means, SD, and individual data points from five independent experiments are shown. A nonparametric, one-tailed Wilcoxon’s paired signed-rank test was applied to test for a potential difference in signals for RPB1 IIo and LACV N between wt LACV 3-h p.i. and the LACVdelNSs 3 and 4-h p.i. time points. *,
