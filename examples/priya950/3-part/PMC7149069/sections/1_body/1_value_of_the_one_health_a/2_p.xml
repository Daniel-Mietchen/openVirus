<p id="Par21">Comparative medicine has long been acknowledged for its benefits in scientific research, and One Health expands comparative medicineâ€™s scope to surveillance in animals and the environment for early detection and better understanding of threats to mitigate risk and impacts. For example, great ape die-offs associated with Ebola virus have often been detected prior to outbreaks in humans, providing a potential predictive value that can help prevent human cases if paired with risk mitigation measures, such as hunter avoidance of carcasses [
