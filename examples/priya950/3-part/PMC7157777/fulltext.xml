However, the vaccine supply cannot cope with an increasing demand posed by urban outbreaks in recent years. Here we report that JE-CVax/Imojev, a YFV-17D-based chimeric Japanese encephalitis vaccine, also efficiently protects against YFV infection in mice. In case of shortage of the YFV vaccine during yellow fever outbreaks, (off-label) use of JE-CVax/Imojev may be considered. Moreover, wider use of JE-CVax/Imojev in Asia may lower the risk of the much-feared YFV spillover to the continent. More generally, chimeric vaccines that combine surface antigens and replication machineries of two distinct flaviviruses may be considered dual vaccines for the latter pathogen without induction of surface-specific antibodies. Following this rationale, novel flavivirus vaccines that do not hold a risk for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection (inherent to current dengue vaccines and dengue vaccine candidates) could be designed.</p></abstract><abstract><title>ABSTRACT</title><p>Recent outbreaks of yellow fever virus (YFV) in West Africa and Brazil resulted in rapid depletion of global vaccine emergency stockpiles and raised concerns about being unprepared against future YFV epidemics. Here we report that a live attenuated virus similar to the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccine JE-CVax/Imojev that consists of YFV-17D vaccine from which the structural (prM/E) genes have been replaced with those of the JEV SA14-14-2 vaccine strain confers full protection in mice against lethal YFV challenge. In contrast to the YFV-17D-mediated protection against YFV, this protection is not mediated by neutralizing antibodies but correlates with YFV-specific nonneutralizing antibodies and T cell responses against cell-associated YFV NS1 and other YFV nonstructural (NS) proteins. Our findings reveal the potential of YFV NS proteins to mediate protection and demonstrate that chimeric flavivirus vaccines, such as Imojev, could confer protection against two flaviviruses. This dual protection may have implications for the possible off-label use of JE-CVax in case of emergency and vaccine shortage during YFV outbreaks. In addition, populations in Asia that have been vaccinated with Imojev may already be protected against YFV should outbreaks ever occur on that continent, as several countries/regions in the Asia-Pacific are vulnerable to international spread of the YFV.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>flavivirus</kwd><kwd>chimeric YFV-17D vaccine</kwd><kwd>chimeric flavivirus vaccine</kwd><kwd>cross-protection</kwd><kwd>dual protection</kwd><kwd>antibody-dependent enhancement</kwd><kwd>nonneutralizing antibodies</kwd><kwd>antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)</kwd><kwd>protective T cell responses</kwd><kwd>off-label use of vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and innovation Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RABYD-VAX_733176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neyts</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dallmeier</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Niraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boudewijns</surname><given-names>Robbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>Sapna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CNPq/FWO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>52/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marques</surname><given-names>Rafael Elias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>KU Leuven (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C3 (C32/16/039)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dallmeier</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neyts</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmid</surname><given-names>Michael Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>Sapna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Niraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>KU Leuven (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOF HB/13/010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neyts</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dallmeier</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Niraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><count count="10" count-type="supplementary-material"/><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="81"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="14614"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>March/April 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Several flaviviruses, such as the yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus, are important human pathogens. Flaviviruses are spread worldwide, though some species show a pronounced restriction to defined regions of endemicity, such as YFV to sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Latin America and JEV to Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific. Certain flaviviruses, such as DENV, WNV, and, most recently, ZIKV, are (re-)emerging in new areas (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Some evidence suggests the first autochthonous transmission of JEV in Africa (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease which is currently endemic to &#x0223c;50 countries with &#x0223c;1 billion people living at risk of infection. Despite the availability of a highly efficient vaccine (YFV-17D; e.g., Stamaril), an estimated &#x0223c;0.2 million YFV infections with 29,000 to 60,000 deaths occur annually (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Recent YFV outbreaks in Angola (2015-2016), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2016), Brazil (2017), and Nigeria (2018) and a shortage of the YF vaccine supply raised serious concerns about the preparedness for future outbreaks (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Since the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aedes aegypti</named-content> mosquito, the main YFV vector, is omnipresent in (sub)tropical Asia, YFV spillover to Asia and the establishment of epidemics involving urban transmission become increasingly realistic (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>For JEV, several licensed inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, including Ixiaro (inactivated vaccine) and JE-CVax (Imojev; YFV-17D-based chimeric live attenuated vaccine [c-LAV]), are available (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Another YFV-17D-based tetravalent c-LAV, namely, against dengue (CYD-TDV, Dengvaxia), has reached marketing licensure and is being introduced in some countries/regions. However, there are serious concerns related to the use of this vaccine in dengue virus-seronegative individuals, mainly because of aggravation of dengue disease by preexisting antibodies (antibody-dependent enhancement [ADE]) of DENV infection (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Vaccination against flaviviruses generally relies on the strategy to mount protective humoral immunity against structural proteins, in particular neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited against the viral envelope (E) protein (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), though also CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells seem to contribute to the protective activity of current YFV vaccines (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Nonetheless, experimental evidence obtained with mice and nonhuman primates for YFV (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and, more recently, in mice also for WNV (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and ZIKV (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) clearly shows that also nonstructural (NS) proteins, in particular NS1, can evoke protective humoral and cellular immune responses. Of note, NS1 is not part of the infectious flavivirus particle and thus not a target of nAbs. Likewise, immunization with an adenovirus vector encoding the NS3 protein of YFV-17D elicited strong CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, which resulted in some degree of protection in mice against subsequent challenge (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, full protection was observed only when the vaccine included the structural proteins of YFV-17D as the antigen as well (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), obviously in line with the accepted role nAbs play in YFV infection. Thus, besides humoral immune responses against the E protein, cellular immune responses against the NS proteins may to some extent also contribute to immunity against flaviviruses. However, no flavivirus vaccines that are based on any of these NS proteins as the target antigen have been developed or licensed yet for human use. Intriguingly, the genome of chimeric flavivirus vaccines (JE-CVax/Imojev or CYD-TDV/Dengvaxia) consists of sequences of antigenically distinct flaviviruses (respectively, JEV and YFV-17D or DENV and YFV-17D) and may therefore exert some dual protective activities. Here we demonstrate that vaccination of mice with a construct similar to JE-CVax/Imojev provides rapidly complete protection against a massively lethal YFV challenge, with a single dose being sufficient for full efficacy. Moreover, we show that this protection is, notwithstanding its unexpected potency, mediated not by nAbs but by multiple complementary and vigorous responses directed against the NS proteins of YFV-17D.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>JE-CVax provides full dual protection against lethal JEV and YFV challenge in mice.</title><p>JE-CVax is a c-LAV that consists of the YFV-17D genome, of which the prM and E genes have been replaced by the corresponding sequences of JEV SA14-14-2. AG129 mice were vaccinated with either 103 or 104 PFU of JE-CVax and 28&#x02009;days later challenged with 103 PFU (equivalent of 1,000 50% lethal doses [LD50]) of YFV.

Therefore, throughout the rest of the study, animals were vaccinated and challenged with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax (full survival in vaccinated mice) and 10<sup>3</sup> PFU of YFV (full mortality in nonvaccinated mice). JE-CVax was originally developed as a JEV vaccine. As expected, unlike nonvaccinated animals (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16), all AG129 mice vaccinated with either JE-CVax (10<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>3</sup>, or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;6) or the inactivated JEV vaccine Ixiaro (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; 2 times at 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g: twice 1/6th human dose) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) were completely protected (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.0001) against lethal JEV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). Remarkably, vaccination with JE-CVax resulted also in 97% survival (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;35/36) against a massively lethal YFV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>). All placebo-vaccinated (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38) and Ixiaro-vaccinated (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) animals had to be euthanized for humane reasons (mean days to euthanasia [MDE], 14.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.8&#x02009;days and 15.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.5, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.0001). Importantly, JE-CVax also conferred similarly vigorous protection against YFV in C57BL/6 wild-type (wt) mice (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) against intracranial (i.c.) challenge with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of YFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1D</xref>). In AG129 mice, a benefit (60% survival) could already be observed 7&#x02009;days postvaccination (dpv). At 14 dpv or later, all animals were fully protected against lethal challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1C</xref>). To establish that JE-CVax-mediated protection against YFV is specific and not the result of some residual cross-reactivity as previously observed for certain flaviviruses in mice (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), we challenged age-matched nonvaccinated (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) or JE-CVax-vaccinated and YFV-17D-challenged (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) AG129 mice with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of the more distantly related ZIKV (strain MR766). No protective activity was observed (MDE for nonvaccinated and vaccinated mice, 23.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.4 and 17.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.8&#x02009;days; <italic>P</italic> = 0.4831) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1B</xref>).

However, some preclinical studies suggested that several NS proteins when used as immunogens for vaccination alone or in combination could induce some degree of protection against viral challenge in mice and nonhuman primates (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). For instance, a recombinant vaccinia virus or replication-deficient adenoviral vectors expressing YFV-17D NS1, NS2a, and NS2b together or NS3 alone, respectively, resulted in some partial protective immunity against a lethal challenge of YFV-17D in mice (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, full survival could never be achieved and reached maximally 60 to 80%, versus 100% for YFV-17D-vaccinated controls. Similarly, 80% protection against challenge with the African YFV strain Dakar 1279 was observed in monkeys following repeated immunization with purified NS1 as the sole vaccine antigen, and protection correlated with the levels of non-nAbs against NS1 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Conversely, vaccination of mice with E protein alone (or in combination with NS1 or NS3) resulted in complete protection (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Like Imojev (commercially available live attenuated JE vaccine), our live attenuated JE-CVax vaccine is a chimeric flavivirus that consists of the genome of YFV-17D from which the prM/E genes have been replaced by those of JEV SA14-14-2, and hence, it is nearly identical to Imojev (i.e., a retroengineered genetic copy) but not formally the same live attenuated virus. We therefore used JE-CVax to assess whether it can offer, besides protection against JEV, protection against YFV challenge. Since AG129 mice are highly susceptible to lethal JEV SA14-14-2 and YFV-17D infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig.&#x000a0;S7</xref>) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), we used these two vaccine strains as established surrogates for wt JEV (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and wt YFV (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), respectively (demanding lower biosafety containment for handling). A single dose of JE-CVax provided, in addition to the expected protection against JEV challenge, nearly complete protection (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) against a massive (1,000 LD<sub>50</sub>] challenge with YFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>). The protective activity against YFV was raised fast, and a survival benefit could be observed already within 7&#x02009;days after vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1C</xref>). These observations were further corroborated by the fact that vaccination of immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice with a single dose of JE-CVax provided complete protection (21/21) against lethal intracranial challenge (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) with YFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4E</xref>). This activity of JE-CVax was YFV specific, as AG129 mice that had been vaccinated with Ixiaro (the inactivated JEV vaccine) were not protected against lethal YFV challenge. Furthermore, mice that had been vaccinated with JE-CVax and that later survived YFV challenge did not survive a subsequent lethal challenge with the ZIKV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref>).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="figS7"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mBio.02494-19.7</object-id><label>FIG&#x000a0;S7</label><p><italic>In vivo</italic> infectivity of YFV-17D and JEV SA14-14-2 in AG129 mice.

Likewise, a chimeric Japanese encephalitis/dengue virus 2 experimental vaccine, ChinDENV (originally designed to induce immunity against DENV-2 prM/E), was shown to protect against both JEV and DENV-2 challenge in mice (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The protection observed could, however, still largely be explained by the induction of considerable levels of E-specific partially cross-reactive nAbs that neutralized both DENV and JEV. Additionally, the study (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) demonstrated that vaccination also induces JEV antigen-specific T cell responses (T cells producing IFN-&#x003b3; and interleukin 2 [IL-2] following stimulation with JEV antigen), suggesting a possible contribution of the cellular immunity in the defense against JEV challenge in ChinDENV-immunized mice. Another study, in which AG129 and IFNAR mice were used, reported that during heterotypic dengue virus infection, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells provide some degree of protection in the absence of detectable levels of nAbs (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). However, in this case a mild (sublethal) DENV-4 infection was used for priming rather than a true vaccine, and despite this priming, only limited (partial) and short-term protection was observed against DENV-2. Moreover, the E proteins of DENV-2 and DENV-4 share high (&#x0223c;64%) sequence homology, including conserved T cell epitopes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and therefore, the contribution of the E protein to protective T cell responses could obviously not be distinguished from what DENV NS proteins may contribute. In contrast, although we also observed some residual cross-reactivity for YFV in serum samples of JE-CVax-vaccinated mice (binding antibody in IIFA [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</xref>]), JE-CVax failed to induce any detectable nAb titers against YFV even following repeated boosting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref>). This finding is in full accordance with the absence of cross-nAbs in mice, monkeys, and humans after JE-CVax or YFV-17D vaccination (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Therefore, cross-reactivity of serum from JE-CVax-vaccinated mice could be attributed to (i) induction of E-based broad flavivirus cross-reactive non-nAbs resulting from flavivirus infection/vaccination (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and (ii) reactivity against YFV-NS1 that is expressed within and on the surface of infected cells and is target of specific binding but non-nAbs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In fact, we demonstrate equivalent levels of anti-YFV-NS1 antibodies in JE-CVax-vaccinated and YFV-17D-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">C</xref>).</p><p>Although we show that JE-CVax immunization resulted in complete protection against YFV-induced disease, there were variations in the actual levels of anti-YFV nAbs after YFV challenge. In some animals, no nAbs were detected against YFV after YFV-17D-challenge. This lack of YFV nAb indicates that JE-CVax possibly conferred sterilizing immunity in these mice. Since such protection cannot be explained by nAb against the YFV-prM/E, it may be accredited to non-nAbs (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and/or adaptive cellular immunity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Some correlation between anti-NS1 antibody levels and the dose of JE-CVax needed to cause protection was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref>), and serum from JE-CVax-vaccinated mice was found to induce an ADCC response against YFV-17D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3</xref>). In addition, in our model both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells seem (in a likely association with anti-NS1 antibodies) to be involved in JE-CVax-mediated protection against YFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4E</xref>). Previously, only humoral immunity and CD4<sup>+</sup> T (but not CD8<sup>+</sup> T) cells have been implied to be sufficient and required for protection against YFV (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), with a strong emphasis on nAb as a historically established immunological correlate of protection for YFV (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and for flaviviruses (such as JEV) in general (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). nAbs possibly block viral spread, whereas cellular immunity efficiently eliminates intracellular viruses either directly or targeted by non-nAbs toward infected cells in an Fc-dependent manner (for example, via ADCC toward cells expressing YFV NS1 on their surfaces) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Indeed, YF-induced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have been shown to act as a &#x0201c;backup defense&#x0201d; system in the absence of nAbs and to participate in viral clearance in particular from the central nervous system (CNS) in mice (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Moreover, strong CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are also detected in the response to human vaccines (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). As we show here, immunization of AG129 and C57BL/6 mice with JE-CVax elicited protective polyfunctional YFV antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (expressing the Th1-type cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;), which is in line with a previous study with a chimeric Japanese encephalitis/dengue virus 2 vaccine (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Previously, clinical studies with humans also demonstrated that vaccination with CYD-TDV/Dengvaxia elicits cell-mediated immunity directed against YFV nonstructural proteins (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Our comparative <italic>in silico</italic> analysis indicated that the YFV-17D backbone is more immunogenic in humans than in mice and provides a hint that CTL responses should be at least as effective in humans as in mice. Likewise, several HLA-binding YFV-17D peptides thus predicted have recently also been confirmed experimentally using human-derived T cells and vaccinated human volunteers (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS10">Fig.&#x000a0;S10</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that JE-CVax-mediated vigorous protection against lethal YFV challenge depends on the combined effects of several effector principles, including both the humoral and cellular immune responses, yet definitely other than nAbs.</p><p>To assess the efficacy of JE-CVax, we employed mice as the <italic>in vivo</italic> model and the YFV-17D vaccine strain (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) as the challenge virus. This experimental setup implies some constraints. Generally, mice are not susceptible to human flavivirus infection (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) and the YFV-17D is not virulent in humans (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). To overcome these limitations, we made use of two established, complementary and stringent mouse infection models that are accepted surrogates for testing of flavivirus vaccines (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>); (i) immunocompromised mice (AG129 mice [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) that develop fatal neurotropic infection when challenged peripherally with YFV-17D, in particular when inoculated with a highly lethal (1,000 LD<sub>50</sub>) challenge virus dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig.&#x000a0;S7</xref>) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and (ii) immunocompetent wt mice (C57BL/6 [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] that can be challenged i.c. with YFV-17D. YFV-17D was originally developed by adapting a viscerotropic clinical isolate (YFV-Asibi) to replication in mouse brains (&#x0201c;fixed to mouse brain&#x0201d;) (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). This vaccine virus can hence be considered a genuine mouse-adapted neurotropic and neurovirulent YFV strain. For this reason, it could also be considered in this study as the challenge virus. Besides experimental convenience (YFV-17D does not require biosafety level 3 [BSL3] containment), YFV-17D is a widely accepted, i.e., best-characterized and hence most widely used, challenge strain in mouse models. Classical i.c. inoculation of YFV-17D consistently causes fatal disease in mice (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) that cannot be distinguished from that induced by wt-YFV strains (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Also, because JE-CVax expresses the prM/E protein of JEV, which belongs to a serocomplex other than YFV, vaccination and subsequent challenge with YFV-17D compares to a certain extent to a heterotypic flavivirus vaccination challenge (as described by others [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]), however, with a markedly more pronounced vaccine efficacy. Therefore, in conclusion, similar mechanisms should hold when using wild-type YFV as the challenge virus (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Obviously, before proceeding to clinical use, this principle should be confirmed in JE-Cvax-vaccinated nonhuman primates, demonstrating protection from subsequent challenge with virulent wt YFV strains.</p><p>Live attenuated JE SA14-14-2 and inactivated Vero cell vaccine account for the biggest use by volume, while Imojev is licensed and used in only a few Asian countries. It is evident from the literature that Imojev remains safe and immunogenic in individuals with a known history of JE vaccination (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). However, further studies are required to address whether Imojev will also induce protective immunity against YFV in those that have already been vaccinated with one of the other JE vaccines. In any case, formal demonstration of vaccine efficacy in humans will be challenging considering that YFV-specific nAbs that are established as a correlate of protection for YFV-17D are absent (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and hence protection against lethal infection may instead need to be shown in nonhuman primate vaccine challenge models. Previous safety and immunogenicity studies of chimeric live attenuated viruses (JE-CVax and ChimeriVax-DEN2) in humans indicated that preexisting immunity to the parental YFV-17D vaccine virus does not interfere with immunization but rather induces long-lasting cross-neutralizing antibody responses (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Importantly, if our data on the dual protection conferred by c-LAV in mice could be translated to other species, including humans, this would imply that the JE vaccine JE-CVax (and likewise Imojev) may provide dual protection, i.e., against both JEV and YFV. A dual protective effect may be of particular relevance in case YFV may one day&#x02014;as is suspected (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)&#x02014;cause outbreaks in (sub)tropical Asia. Given the capacity problems with the production of the current YFV vaccine, having another licensed vaccine (i.e., JE-CVax/Imojev) available as an alternative means to protect against YFV may at such time help to contain an outbreak. In addition, those already vaccinated with JE-CVax may be expected to be protected against YFV. A similar principle may apply to other chimeric flavivirus vaccines that consist of a YFV-17D backbone (such as CYD-TDV/Dengvaxia) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and others under development (such as our recently proposed chimeric YFV-17D/ZIKV vaccine candidate) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Likewise, c-LAVs could be generated against DENV and other viruses that may cause ADE using the backbone of the parent virus (e.g., DENV) from which the prM/E genes have been replaced by that of antigenically more distantly related viruses or serotypes, in line with experimental evidence that the DENV NS1 protein can also serve as a protective antigen (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Such an approach may avoid potentially harmful nAb responses. The same principle may apply to c-LAV for ZIKV using a ZIKV backbone (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) and prM/E sequences of another flavivirus that has not been shown to cause ADE.</p><p>To conclude, we demonstrate that JE-CVax efficiently and rapidly induces high cross-protective efficacy (&#x0223c;100%) in mice against YFV challenge, even with an exceedingly aggressive challenge inoculum. The study provides evidence that c-LAV flavivirus vaccines may be developed solely based on NS proteins. Moreover, immunization with a chimeric flavivirus, whereby the prM/E genes of the backbone have been replaced by that of yet another flavivirus, may have a dual protective effect. A vaccine such as Imojev/JE-CVax may thus be suitable for off-label use, namely, for protection against YFV, which in this case is not mediated by nAbs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Cells and medium.</title><p>BHK-21J and Vero E6 cells used in this study were a generous gift from Peter Bredenbeek, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), the Netherlands.
