<p>From the IIFA analysis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>), it is obvious that sera from JE-CVax-vaccinated mice contain cross-reactive but nonneutralizing Abs against YFV-17D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). These non-nAbs may possibly be attributed to NS1, a strong B cell antigen. To assess the presence of anti-YFV NS1 antibodies in JE-CVax-vaccinated AG129 mice, a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed on sera from mice vaccinated with 10
 <sup>3</sup> to 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of JE-CVax or mice infected with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of YFV-17D or 10
 <sup>5</sup> of PFU ZIKV-MR766. Serum was obtained either at the onset of disease (YFV-17D, 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of JE-CVax and ZIKV) or at 28 dpv. Levels of anti-YFV NS1 antibodies in the different JE-CVax-vaccinated groups were statistically not different (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) from those in the YFV-17D-infected groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Moreover, very low cross-reactivity was noted for samples from ZIKV-infected mice. These findings were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Serum antibodies from JE-CVax-vaccinated mice bound to cells that overexpress YFV NS1 as well as to cells that had been infected with YFV-17D. In fact, serum from JE-CVax-vaccinated mice resulted in staining comparable to that obtained when monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1A5, specifically directed against YFV NS1, was used (
