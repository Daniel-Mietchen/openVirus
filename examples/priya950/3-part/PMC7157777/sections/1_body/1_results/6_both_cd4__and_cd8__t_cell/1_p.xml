<p>To determine whether YFV-specific T cell responses directly contribute to the JE-CVax-mediated protection against YFV, T cell depletion experiments were performed with C57BL/6 mice (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Animals at 5 weeks postvaccination were administered with anti-mouse CD4 and/or anti-mouse CD8a T cell-depleting antibodies twice, i.e., 2 days before and immediately prior to YFV challenge. Unlike for vaccinated (but not further treated) animals (that were included as immunization controls [
 <italic>n</italic> = 5] and that survived an intracranial YFV challenge), in vaccinated but antibody-treated mice the previously observed full protection against YFV was partially lost by targeting CD4
 <sup>+</sup> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1/8), CD8
 <sup>+</sup> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3/7), and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> CD8
 <sup>+</sup> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5/7) T cells for depletion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>). All nonvaccinated animals (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0027) succumbed to YFV challenge as before (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The mortality resulting from T cell depletion, especially the increased mortality observed in the doubly depleted animal group, suggests that in the absence of nAb both CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to the JE-CVax-mediated protection against YFV in C57BL/6 mice.
