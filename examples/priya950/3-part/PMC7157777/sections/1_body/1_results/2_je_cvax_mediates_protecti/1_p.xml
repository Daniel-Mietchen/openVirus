<p>To explore whether humoral immunity is involved in JE-CVax-mediated protection against YFV, serum of AG129 mice (i) at day 0 (prevaccinated), (ii) infected with YFV-17D before euthanasia (terminal serum), (iii) vaccinated with JE-CVax (day 28; postvaccinated), or (iv) vaccinated with JE-CVax and challenged with YFV-17D (day 56; postchallenge) was analyzed for total binding antibodies and nAb. All animals vaccinated with JE-CVax or Ixiaro seroconverted to JEV positivity. Sera of nonvaccinated animals that had been infected with YFV-17D showed only some residual reactivity for JEV (as detected by indirect immune fluorescence assay [IIFA] [
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>]). In contrast, nAbs against JEV were exclusively detected in serum samples of JE-CVax- or Ixiaro-vaccinated animals (50% neutralizing antibody titer as determined using CPE-based virus neutralization tests [log
 <sub>10</sub> CPENT
 <sub>50</sub>], 2.48 ± 0.29 or 1.86 ± 0.36, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Only when JE-CVax-vaccinated mice were challenged at a later stage with YFV-17D were nAbs against the latter virus raised (log
 <sub>10</sub> CPENT
 <sub>50</sub>, 1.66 ± 0.30; determined 28 days after YFV exposure). Also in serum of JE-CVax- or Ixiaro-vaccinated C57BL/6 mice, only nAbs against JEV (log
 <sub>10</sub> CPENT
 <sub>50</sub>, 1.66 ± 0.12 or 1.61 ± 0.09, respectively) were detectable. However, all the C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) vaccinated with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU YFV-17D in the presence (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) or absence of MAR1 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9) developed nAbs against YFV (log
 <sub>10</sub> CPENT
 <sub>50</sub>, 2.11 ± 0.25 or 1.78 ± 0.29, respectively) and survived lethal i.c. challenge of YFV. Thus, neither JE-CVax nor Ixiaro induces YFV-specific nAbs in mice.
