<p>To determine the potential mechanism that non-nAbs elicit for protection against YFV, an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) reporter bioassay was carried out using HEK293T cells infected with YFV-17D (expressing mCherry) (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) as target cells and murine Fcγ receptor IIIA (FcγRIIIa)-expressing Jurkat reporter cells as effector cells (
