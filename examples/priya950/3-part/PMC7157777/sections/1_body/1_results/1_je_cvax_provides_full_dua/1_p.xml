<p>JE-CVax is a c-LAV that consists of the YFV-17D genome, of which the prM and E genes have been replaced by the corresponding sequences of JEV SA14-14-2. AG129 mice were vaccinated with either 103 or 104 PFU of JE-CVax and 28 days later challenged with 103 PFU (equivalent of 1,000 50% lethal doses [LD50]) of YFV. This resulted in, respectively, 80 or 100% survival, while YFV infection was uniformly lethal in all nonvaccinated controls (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A</xref> in the supplemental material). Therefore, throughout the rest of the study, animals were vaccinated and challenged with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax (full survival in vaccinated mice) and 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of YFV (full mortality in nonvaccinated mice). JE-CVax was originally developed as a JEV vaccine. As expected, unlike nonvaccinated animals (
 <italic>n</italic> = 16), all AG129 mice vaccinated with either JE-CVax (10
 <sup>2</sup>, 10
 <sup>3</sup>, or 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU; 
 <italic>n</italic> ≤ 6) or the inactivated JEV vaccine Ixiaro (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10; 2 times at 1 μg: twice 1/6th human dose) (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) were completely protected (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.0001) against lethal JEV challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Remarkably, vaccination with JE-CVax resulted also in 97% survival (
 <italic>n</italic> = 35/36) against a massively lethal YFV challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). All placebo-vaccinated (
 <italic>n</italic> = 38) and Ixiaro-vaccinated (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12) animals had to be euthanized for humane reasons (mean days to euthanasia [MDE], 14.6 ± 2.8 days and 15.4 ± 3.5, 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.0001). Importantly, JE-CVax also conferred similarly vigorous protection against YFV in C57BL/6 wild-type (wt) mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 16) against intracranial (i.c.) challenge with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of YFV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In AG129 mice, a benefit (60% survival) could already be observed 7 days postvaccination (dpv). At 14 dpv or later, all animals were fully protected against lethal challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). To establish that JE-CVax-mediated protection against YFV is specific and not the result of some residual cross-reactivity as previously observed for certain flaviviruses in mice (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), we challenged age-matched nonvaccinated (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7) or JE-CVax-vaccinated and YFV-17D-challenged (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) AG129 mice with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of the more distantly related ZIKV (strain MR766). No protective activity was observed (MDE for nonvaccinated and vaccinated mice, 23.5 ± 5.4 and 17.4 ± 8.8 days; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.4831) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Thus, a single-dose immunization with JE-CVax provides fast (≤14 dpv) and virus-specific protection against lethal YFV exposure in mice.
