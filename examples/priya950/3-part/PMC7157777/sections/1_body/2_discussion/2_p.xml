<p>Like Imojev (commercially available live attenuated JE vaccine), our live attenuated JE-CVax vaccine is a chimeric flavivirus that consists of the genome of YFV-17D from which the prM/E genes have been replaced by those of JEV SA14-14-2, and hence, it is nearly identical to Imojev (i.e., a retroengineered genetic copy) but not formally the same live attenuated virus. We therefore used JE-CVax to assess whether it can offer, besides protection against JEV, protection against YFV challenge. Since AG129 mice are highly susceptible to lethal JEV SA14-14-2 and YFV-17D infection (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), we used these two vaccine strains as established surrogates for wt JEV (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and wt YFV (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), respectively (demanding lower biosafety containment for handling). A single dose of JE-CVax provided, in addition to the expected protection against JEV challenge, nearly complete protection (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) against a massive (1,000 LD
 <sub>50</sub>] challenge with YFV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The protective activity against YFV was raised fast, and a survival benefit could be observed already within 7 days after vaccination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). These observations were further corroborated by the fact that vaccination of immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice with a single dose of JE-CVax provided complete protection (21/21) against lethal intracranial challenge (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) with YFV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>). This activity of JE-CVax was YFV specific, as AG129 mice that had been vaccinated with Ixiaro (the inactivated JEV vaccine) were not protected against lethal YFV challenge. Furthermore, mice that had been vaccinated with JE-CVax and that later survived YFV challenge did not survive a subsequent lethal challenge with the ZIKV (
