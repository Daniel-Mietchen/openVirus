<p>Others have shown in mice that cross-reactive antibodies (together with cross-reactive T cells) may confer partial protection against flaviviruses from different serocomplexes, as demonstrated for JEV (both Vero cell-derived JEV-P3 strain-based inactivated vaccine and JEV SA14-14-2)-vaccinated mice challenged with DENV (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Likewise, a chimeric Japanese encephalitis/dengue virus 2 experimental vaccine, ChinDENV (originally designed to induce immunity against DENV-2 prM/E), was shown to protect against both JEV and DENV-2 challenge in mice (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The protection observed could, however, still largely be explained by the induction of considerable levels of E-specific partially cross-reactive nAbs that neutralized both DENV and JEV. Additionally, the study (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) demonstrated that vaccination also induces JEV antigen-specific T cell responses (T cells producing IFN-γ and interleukin 2 [IL-2] following stimulation with JEV antigen), suggesting a possible contribution of the cellular immunity in the defense against JEV challenge in ChinDENV-immunized mice. Another study, in which AG129 and IFNAR mice were used, reported that during heterotypic dengue virus infection, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells provide some degree of protection in the absence of detectable levels of nAbs (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). However, in this case a mild (sublethal) DENV-4 infection was used for priming rather than a true vaccine, and despite this priming, only limited (partial) and short-term protection was observed against DENV-2. Moreover, the E proteins of DENV-2 and DENV-4 share high (∼64%) sequence homology, including conserved T cell epitopes (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and therefore, the contribution of the E protein to protective T cell responses could obviously not be distinguished from what DENV NS proteins may contribute. In contrast, although we also observed some residual cross-reactivity for YFV in serum samples of JE-CVax-vaccinated mice (binding antibody in IIFA [
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>]), JE-CVax failed to induce any detectable nAb titers against YFV even following repeated boosting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). This finding is in full accordance with the absence of cross-nAbs in mice, monkeys, and humans after JE-CVax or YFV-17D vaccination (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Therefore, cross-reactivity of serum from JE-CVax-vaccinated mice could be attributed to (i) induction of E-based broad flavivirus cross-reactive non-nAbs resulting from flavivirus infection/vaccination (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and (ii) reactivity against YFV-NS1 that is expressed within and on the surface of infected cells and is target of specific binding but non-nAbs (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In fact, we demonstrate equivalent levels of anti-YFV-NS1 antibodies in JE-CVax-vaccinated and YFV-17D-infected mice (
