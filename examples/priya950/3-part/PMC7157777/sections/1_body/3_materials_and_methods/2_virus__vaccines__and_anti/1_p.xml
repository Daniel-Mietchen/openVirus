<p>Stamaril (G5400) and Ixiaro (JEV16F290) were from Sanofi Pasteur (France) and Valneva (Austria), respectively. Stamaril was passaged two times in Vero E6 cells (YFV-17D-G5400P2) and stored at −80°C. YFV-17D-G5400P2 was used throughout the study to challenge mice and is referred to as YFV-17D. YFV-17D-based Japanese encephalitis c-LAV Imojev (Chimerivax-JE, JE-CVax) is not available in Europe and was, therefore, retroengineered according to publicly available sequence information (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) (patent number WO2006044857A2). To that end, a DNA fragment encoding the prM and E proteins of JEV vaccine strain SA14-14-2 was custom synthetized (IDT Integrated DNA Technologies, Haasrode, Belgium) and subcloned into the YFV-17D expression vector pShuttle-YFV-17D (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) (patent number WO2014174078 A1) of our plasmid-launched live attenuated vaccine (PLLAV)-YFV-17D platform using standard molecular biology techniques and thereby replacing the YFV-17D prM/E sequences. Two adaptive mutations in NS2A and NS4B genes and an additional Kas1 site at the end of the prM/E coding sequence (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. To generate JE-CVax virus, BHK-21J cells were transfected with PLLAV-JE-CVax using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Upon onset of cytopathic effect (CPE), JE-CVax virus was harvested, centrifuged at 4,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C. Similarly, the live attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine JEV SA14-14-2 (GenBank accession no.

The recombinant JE-CVax and JEV SA14-14-2 viruses were subsequently passaged on Vero E6 cells to generate virus stocks. As an alternative challenge virus, ZIKV strain MR766 was used (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Virus titers were determined on BHK-21J cells by plaque assays (PFU per milliliter) and CPE-based assays (50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID
 <sub>50</sub>] per milliliter) as described below.
