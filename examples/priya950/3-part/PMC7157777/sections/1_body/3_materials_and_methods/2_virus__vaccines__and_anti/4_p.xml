<p>An MHC class I-restricted peptide from YFV-17D nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) (sequence ATLTYRML) (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>) was synthetized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Total cellular antigen for YFV-17D and JEV SA14-14-2 was prepared first by infecting Vero E6 cells with YFV-17D and JEV SA14-14-2, respectively, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Noninfected Vero E6 cells were used as a control. Four days postinfection, cells were harvested either by trypsinization or by detaching through pipetting when CPE was visible. Following centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cell lysates were prepared by four freeze-thaw cycles. Overnight UV irradiation was performed to inactivate the virus in the cell lysate preparations, and large debris was removed via filtering through 70-Î¼m cell strainers (BD Biosciences).
