<p>Plasmid pCMV-YFV-17D NS1-IRES-EGFP, which drives the mammalian expression of YFV-17D NS1 as a transcriptional fusion to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was generated by PCR cloning of YFV-17D nt 2381 to 3508 cDNA (including an E protein-derived N-terminal signal peptide) (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) flanked by a 5′-terminal Kozak sequence and 3′-terminal stop codon into the NheI and SalI sites of pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech catalog no. 6029-1).
