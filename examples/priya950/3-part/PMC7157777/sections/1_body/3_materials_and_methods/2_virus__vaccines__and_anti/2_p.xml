<p>A YFV-17D reporter virus (YFV-17D-mCherry) was generated that expresses the red fluorescent protein mCherry as a translational fusion to the N terminus of YFV-17D C protein. In brief, using standard PCR techniques and homologous recombination in 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (strain YPH500), a synthetic DNA fragment encoding codons 2 to 236 of mCherry (GenBank accession no.

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) immediately downstream of nucleotide (nt) position 181, flanked (i) at its 5′ terminus by a glycine-serine linker (BamHI site) and (ii) at the 3′ end by a

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) followed by a repeat of codons 2 to 21 of the YFV-17D C gene, yet with an alternative codon usage to avoid RNA recombination during viral replication. YFV-17D-mCherry was rescued by transfection of the resulting PLLAV-YFV-17D-mCherry of BHK 21J as described previously (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). A full characterization of YFV-17D-mCherry is available upon request (M. A. Schmid, N. Mishra, S. Sharma, R. Boudewijns, J. Neyts, and K. Dallmeier, unpublished data).
