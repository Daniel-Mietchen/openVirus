<p>Viral titers of YFV-17D or JE-CVax preparations were determined using plaque assays on BHK-21J cells. In brief, 10
 <sup>6</sup> BHK-21J cells per well were plated in 6-well plates and cultured overnight in seeding medium. Cells were washed with PBS and inoculated with virus of different dilutions prepared in the assay medium for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Culture supernatants of uninfected cells were used as negative controls. Cells were thoroughly washed with the assay medium and overlaid with 2× minimal essential medium (MEM; Gibco, Belgium) supplemented with 4% FCS and 0.75% sodium bicarbonate containing 0.5% low-melting-point agarose (Invitrogen, USA). The overlay was allowed to solidify at RT; cells were then cultured for 7 days at 37°C, fixed with 8% formaldehyde, and stained with methylene blue. Plaques were manually counted and plaque titer was determined as PFU per milliliter.
