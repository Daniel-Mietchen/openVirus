<p>Mouse TNF-α and IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays were performed with a mouse TNF-α ELISpot kit (ImmunoSpot MTNFA-1M/5; CTL Europe GmbH) or a mouse IFN-γ ELISpot kit (ImmunoSpot MIFNG-1M/5; CTL Europe GmbH) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Assay plates (96-well polyvinylidene difluoride [PVDF] membrane), antibodies, enzymes, substrate, and diluent were included in the kits. Briefly, 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> mouse splenocytes/well were plated with either with 5 μg/ml of YFV-17D NS3 ATLTYRML peptide antigen (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) or with 50 μg/ml of total Vero E6 cellular antigen in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and 0.75% sodium bicarbonate. After 24 h of incubation at 37°C, spots of mouse TNF-α or IFN-γ were visualized by subsequent addition of detection antibody, enzyme, and substrate. All plates were scanned using an ImmunoSpot S6 universal reader (CTL Europe GmbH). Spot counts were normalized by subtracting the number of spots from corresponding samples stimulated with noninfected Vero E6.
