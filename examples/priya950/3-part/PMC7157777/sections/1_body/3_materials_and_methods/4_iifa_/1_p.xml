<p>To determine the seroconversion of animals, all JEV, YFV, and ZIKV IgG indirect immunofluorescence assays (IIFAs) were performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany), except for the use of labeled secondary antibody and the mounting agent glycerine, which were replaced by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (A-11029; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; ProLong antifade reagent with DAPI; Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively. Serum from nonvaccinated animals served as a naive, negative control. Slides were visualized using a fluorescence microscope (FLoid cell imaging station; Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
