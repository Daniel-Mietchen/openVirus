<p>BHK-21J and Vero E6 cells used in this study were a generous gift from Peter Bredenbeek, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), the Netherlands. Cells were maintained in seeding medium containing MEM Rega-3 medium (Gibco, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Gibco), 2 mM glutamine (Gibco), and 0.75% sodium bicarbonate (Gibco). HEK 293 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells; ATCC CRL-1573) were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) containing 10% FCS and 100 U/ml of penicillin-streptomycin solution (pen-strep; Gibco). Virus culture and cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization testing (CPENT) were performed in assay medium, which was the seeding medium supplemented with only 2% FCS. HEK 293 cells were transfected with YF-NS1-GFP using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC, Belgium), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Infection of HEK 293 cells with YFV-17D-mCherry (see below) was performed in DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS and 100 U/ml of pen/strep solution. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 95% to 99% humidity.
