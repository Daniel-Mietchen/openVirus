<p>To assess the possible role of nonneutralizing YFV antibody-mediated protection against YFV after JE-CVax vaccination, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) bioassays (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) were performed as prescribed by the manufacturer (ADCC reporter bioassay complete kit; Promega; catalog no. G7010). In brief, target cells were prepared by infecting HEK 293T cells with YFV-17D-mCherry in assay medium. Cells were incubated at 37°C postinfection and later, upon onset of CPE, harvested by trypsinization. Cells were again plated in white, flat-bottom 96-well assay plates (Viewplate-96; PerkinElmer; catalog no. 6005181) at densities of 7,500 and 25,000 cells per well for 8 h at 37°C in assay medium. Later, in a separate 96-well plate, JE-CVax hyperimmune and nonimmune heat-inactivated mouse serum samples (starting dilution of 1/9) were serially diluted 3-fold in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 4% low-IgG serum. ADCC bioassay effector cells (Jurkat V variant cells) were diluted to 3 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium. The supernatant from the infected cell plate was replaced with fresh RPMI medium (25 μl/well), and diluted serum samples (25 μl/well) and E cells (25 μl/well) were added to the infection plate. After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, Bio-Glo luciferase assay reagent (75 μl/well) was added, and luminescence was measured using a Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan). The average background plus three SDs was calculated and used as background.
