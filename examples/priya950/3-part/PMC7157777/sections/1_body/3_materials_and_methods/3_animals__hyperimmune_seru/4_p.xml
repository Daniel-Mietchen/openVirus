<p>Immunocompetent wt C57BL/6JOIaHsd, i.e., C57BL/6, mice were purchased from ENVIGO Labs, the Netherlands, and were maintained and manipulated as described for AG129 mice, with some modifications (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Since flaviviruses do not readily replicate in immunocompetent wild-type mice (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), the mice were immunized with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax in the presence of 2.5 mg of an IFN-α/β receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR-1) binding monoclonal antibody, MAR1-5A3, administered i.p. 1 day prior to immunization. MAR1-5A3 antibody (0.5 mg) was also readministered i.p. on day 4 and day 7 postvaccination. Animals were bled 28 days postvaccination and challenged i.c. with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of YFV-17D in a volume of 30 μl. A full characterization of immunogenicity of YFV-17D in various mouse strains is available upon request (J. Ma, N. Mishra, R. Boudewijns, J. Neyts, and K. Dallmeier, unpublished data). For T cell depletion studies, C57BL/6 mice were either sham vaccinated or vaccinated i.p. with 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax 35 days prior to i.c. challenge with 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of YFV-17D. At day −2 and day 0 prior to YFV challenge, 0.5 mg of either anti-mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5; Leinco Technologies, USA) or anti-mouse CD8a (clone 53-6.7; Leinco Technologies) or a combination of both was administered i.p. (
