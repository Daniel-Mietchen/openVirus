<p>Hyperimmune serum was prepared by vaccinating AG129 mice with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax, followed by two boosts with 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of JE-CVax at 14-day intervals. Another 14 days after the second booster, animals were bled twice per week for the following 4 weeks. All serum batches were then pooled and CPENTs for JE-CVax and YFV-17D were performed. We did not observe any YFV nAbs in the hyperimmune sera but did see an ∼3.6-fold (log
 <sub>10</sub> CPENT
 <sub>50</sub> titer, 3.03 ± 0.18) selective increase in neutralizing titers against JE-CVax compared to single vaccination (
