<p>Host IFN signaling is the major barrier to viscerotropism and for pathogenicity of neurotropic flaviviruses (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). In line, wild-type mice are poorly susceptible to infection with flaviviruses (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), including YFV-17D infection and vaccination (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Likewise, type I (IFN-α/β) and type II (IFN-γ) interferon signaling mutually controls YFV-17D infection. Unlike in humans (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), type I IFN (IFN-α/β) can restrict YFV-Asibi as well as YFV-17D infection in mice (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Similarly, IFN-γ exerts restriction on YFV-17D replication, dissemination, and clearance in mice (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). YFV-17D is neurotropic in wt mice when directly injected into the brain (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). In AG129 mice, IFN-α/β and -γ receptors are knocked out, which results in neurotropic infection following peripheral inoculation of YFV-17D. Therefore, to allow transient replication (and thus vaccination) of YFV-17D in wt mice, MAR1-5A3 antibodies were coadministered to block type I IFN signaling in C57BL/6 mice.
