<p>Six- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 or AG129 mice were vaccinated with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax and 4 and 18 weeks later, the animals were euthanized for analysis. Spleens were harvested and processed for ELISpot and flow cytometric analyses. To generate single-cell suspensions, spleens were pushed through 70-μm cell strainers (BD Biosciences) with syringe plungers, digested in 1.0 mg/ml of type 1 collagenase and 10 U/ml DNase for 30 min, vigorously pipetted, and filtered through 100-μm nylon meshes. Spleen samples were then incubated with red blood cell lysis buffer (eBioscience) for 8 min at room temperature and washed twice with FACS-B.
