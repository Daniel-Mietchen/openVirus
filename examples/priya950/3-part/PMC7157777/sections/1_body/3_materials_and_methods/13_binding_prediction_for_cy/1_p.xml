<p>Binding to the MHC class I molecules of peptides comprised in the NS proteins of YFV-17D was predicted by NetMHCPan4.0 (

The full amino acid sequence of YFV-17D NS proteins was entered into the server to predict the 20 peptides (8- to 14-mers) with the highest affinity to their respective MHC/HLA class I molecules, such as mouse H2-Kb (C57BL/6 and S129 background), rhesus macaque Mamu-A*01, and some commonly found HLA types (HLA-A*02, HLA-A*24, and HLA-B*15) in men (
