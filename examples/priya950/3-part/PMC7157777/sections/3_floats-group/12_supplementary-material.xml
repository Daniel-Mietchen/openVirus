 <p>Gating strategy for flow cytometry analysis. (A and B) Exclusion of debris was achieved by gating out the FSC-low population in a plot of FSC-A versus SSC-A. Then, only single cells were retained by elimination of the high-SSC-W population in a plot of SSC-W versus SSC-H. In a subsequent step, live cells were selected by gating out the Zombie Aqua-positive population as shown in a plot of NS1-eGFP/FSC-A versus ZA. Finally, for the detection of anti-NS1 antibodies (A), cells were gated based on positivity for NS1-eGFP and positivity/negativity of anti-NS1 Ab PE-Cy7. (B) For intracellular cytokine staining, based on positivity for CD3e (eFluor450 conjugated) and negativity (CD4) or positivity for CD8a (APC/Cy7-conjugated), CD4
  <sup>+</sup> and CD8
  <sup>+</sup> T cell populations were defined as CD3
  <sup>+</sup> CD8
  <sup>−</sup> and CD3
  <sup>+</sup> CD8
  <sup>+</sup> populations, respectively. Finally, cells were gated based on positivity/negativity for IFN-γ and positivity/negativity of TNF-α. Samples from nonvaccinated mice were used to set the boundaries that define cells positive and negative for intracellular markers. Download
