  <p>Role of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) conferred by JE-CVax hyperimmune serum in the protection against YFV. JE-CVax hyperimmune serum was tested for its ability to mediate ADCC activity compared to serum of nonvaccinated mice (normal serum) at 3:1 (A) and 10:1 (B) effector (E)-to-target (T) cell ratios. Experiments were conducted twice, each in triplicate, and data are presented as means ± SEMs for fold changes compared to control (CC) (i.e., mean reporter signal plus three SDs from E:T in the absence of hyperimmune serum). Values from noninfected target cells incubated with E in the presence of either hyperimmune serum or normal serum at highest antibody concentrations (dilution 1:9) are indicated as Control-9. Statistical significance was determined using two-way ANOVA. * and ****, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05 and 0.0001 compared to normal serum.
