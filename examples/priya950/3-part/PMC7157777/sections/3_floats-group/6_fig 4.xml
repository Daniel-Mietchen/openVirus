  <p>Detection of protective T cell responses directed against YFV. (A to C) ELISpot assay data showing TNF-α (A) IFN-γ (B and C) and production by splenocytes of AG129 mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5; A and B) or C57BL/6 (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10; C) at 18 and 4 weeks, respectively, after vaccination with 10
   <sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax, following 16 h 
   <italic>ex vivo</italic> restimulation with either an MHC class I-restricted peptide derived from YFV-17D NS3 (
   <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) or the lysate of YFV-17D- or JEV SA14-14-2-infected Vero E6 cells. Stimulation using lysate of noninfected Vero E6 cells served as a negative control. The data are derived from two independent experiments. Spot counts were normalized by subtraction of the number of spots in corresponding wells stimulated with uninfected Vero E6 cell lysate. (D) Cytokine expression profile of YFV-specific T cells. Shown are IFN-γ and TNF-α production profiles of YFV-specific CD4
   <sup>+</sup> and CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells from JE-CVax-vaccinated AG129 and C57BL/6 mice 18 and 4 weeks, respectively, postvaccination, as determined by intracellular cytokine staining. Mouse splenocytes were stimulated 16 h 
   <italic>ex vivo</italic> with either an MHC class I-restricted NS3 peptide, cell lysate of YFV-17D-infected Vero E6 cells, or lysate of uninfected Vero E6 cells. The data are derived from two independent experiments and normalized by subtraction of number of cytokine-secreting T cells in corresponding samples in which uninfected Vero E6 cell lysate was used as recall antigen. (E) T cell-mediated 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> protection against YFV. Loss of protection resulting from antibody-mediated T cell depletion (
   <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
   <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) suggests a direct functional involvement of CD4
   <sup>+</sup> and CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in JE-CVax-mediated immunity against YFV in C57BL/6 mice (
   <italic>n</italic> ≥ 7) that had been vaccinated with 10
   <sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax and subsequently challenged intracranially with 10
   <sup>4</sup> PFU of YFV-17D. Depletions were performed by administration of 0.5 mg of anti-mouse CD4 and/or anti-mouse CD8 antibodies i.p. on day −2 and day 0 each prior to YFV challenge. Log rank (Mantel-Cox) survival analysis test was performed for statistical significance. * and **, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05 and 0.01 compared to vaccinated group (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5); 
   <sup>+</sup>, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05 compared to CD4-depleted group (
   <italic>n</italic> = 8).
