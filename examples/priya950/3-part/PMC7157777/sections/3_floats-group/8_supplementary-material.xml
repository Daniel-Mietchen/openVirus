 <p>Detection of T cell responses in mice by intracellular staining for TNF-α and IFN-γ using flow cytometry. Shown are results from flow cytometric analysis for intracellular TNF-α (A, B, E, and F) and IFN-γ (C, D, G, and H) production by CD4
  <sup>+</sup> (A, C, E, and G) or CD8
  <sup>+</sup> (B, D, F, and H) T cells from vaccinated AG129 mice (A to D) and C57BL/6 mice (E to H) following stimulation with either NS3 MHC class I peptide or cell lysate of YFV-17D or JEV SA14-14-2-infected Vero E6 cells. The percentage of total CD4
  <sup>+</sup> or CD8
  <sup>+</sup> TNF-α- or IFN-γ-secreting T cells analyzed in flow cytometric analysis in AG129 mice (
  <italic>n</italic> = 5) and C57BL/6 mice (
  <italic>n</italic> = 10) was determined. The tables in panels I and J represent 
  <italic>P</italic> values between cytokine-secreting populations of antigen- versus noninfected Vero E6 cell-stimulated samples (statistical significance; paired 
  <italic>t</italic> test) in flow cytometric analysis for splenocytes from AG129 and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. The data were compiled from two independent experiments, and dotted lines represent average background in control samples collected from non-vaccinated animals. Download
