 <p>Correlation of nAb titers determined as log
  <sub>10</sub> PRNT
  <sub>50</sub> and log
  <sub>10</sub> CPENT
  <sub>50</sub> in matched serum samples of JE-CVax-vaccinated and/or YFV-17D-challenged mice. AG129 mice (
  <italic>n</italic> = 7) were vaccinated with 10
  <sup>4</sup> PFU of JE-CVax and at 28 dpv challenged with 10
  <sup>3</sup> PFU YFV-17D. Serum was harvested and neutralization assays, i.e., CPENT and PRNT, were performed as described in Materials and Methods. Data show a good correlation (Pearson correlation [
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sup>2</sup>] = 0.071; 
  <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) between log
  <sub>10</sub> YFV PRNT
  <sub>50</sub> and log
  <sub>10</sub> YFV CPENT
  <sub>50</sub> of matched samples (A). There was no marked increase in the log
  <sub>10</sub> JE-CVax PRNT
  <sub>50</sub> and log
  <sub>10</sub> JE-CVax CPENT
  <sub>50</sub> (
  <italic>P</italic> values, 0.156 and 0.062, respectively) found when comparing matched serum samples from before and after challenge with YFV-17D using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (B and C). The limit of detection for each assay was log
  <sub>10</sub>20, i.e., 1.3. Download
