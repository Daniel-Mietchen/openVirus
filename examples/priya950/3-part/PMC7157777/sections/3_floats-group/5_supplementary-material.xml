 <p>Effect of JE-CVax hyperimmune serum in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). JE-CVax hyperimmune serum (circles) was tested for its ability to mediate ADCC activity in comparison to serum of nonvaccinated mice (squares) at 3:1 (A) and 10:1 (B) effector (E)-to-target (T) ratios. Data are from experiments conducted twice, each in triplicate, and presented as means ± SEMs. The average of relative light unit signal plus three standard deviations from E:T ratios in the absence of hyperimmune serum was considered the background signal (CC). Statistical significance was determined using two-way ANOVA. *, **, ***, and ****,
