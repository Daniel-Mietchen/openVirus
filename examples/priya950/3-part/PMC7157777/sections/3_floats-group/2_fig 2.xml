  <p>Serological analysis of serum of JE-CVax-vaccinated and YFV-17D- or ZIKV-MR766-challenged animals. (A) Detection of nAbs against JEV and YFV. CPE neutralization tests (CPENT) for JE-CVax (circles) and YFV-17D (squares) were performed on sera day 0 prior to vaccination (preimmune, red), day 28 after vaccination (blue), and after challenge (study endpoint, orange) for samples of JE-CVax-vaccinated AG129 mice, of JE-CVax-vaccinated mice after subsequent YFV-17D-challenge (
   <italic>n</italic> = 34), of mice hyperimmunized with JE-CVax (
   <italic>n</italic> = 13; first bleed 2 weeks post last booster immunization, blue), and of mice vaccinated with Ixiaro (green). Limit of detection (LOD) for virus neutralization was log
   <sub>10</sub> 20 (1.3). Data are presented as log
   <sub>10</sub> CPENT
   <sub>50</sub> (mean ± SD). The data presented are from ≥3 independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA. ****, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001 for mean log
   <sub>10</sub> CPENT
   <sub>50</sub> titers against JEV or YFV compared to mean log
   <sub>10</sub> CPENT
   <sub>50</sub> titers before JE-CVax vaccination and before YFV-17D-challenge, respectively. (B) Quantitation of anti-YFV NS1 binding antibodies by direct ELISA. Serum from naive, nonvaccinated mice (red) or mice that had been vaccinated with 10
   <sup>3</sup> to 10
   <sup>5</sup> of PFU JE-CVax (blue) or that had been infected with 10
   <sup>4</sup> PFU of YFV-17D (orange) or with 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV-MR766 (pink) were collected either 28 days postimmunization or when euthanized at the humane endpoint (
   <italic>n</italic> ≥ 5). The data are means of two independent analyses. Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA. **, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01 compared to YFV-17D. (C) Binding of serum antibodies to NS1-expressing cells. HEK 293 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing YFV-17D NS1 as a transcriptional fusion to GFP (top) or infected with the YFV-17D-mCherry reporter virus (bottom). Either 48 h after transfection or 72 h after infection, cells were stained with the anti-YFV NS1-specific MAb 1A5 (left), with serum from mice that were vaccinated with JE-CVax (center), or with serum from naive, nonvaccinated mice (right). Graphs show flow cytometric analysis of GFP or mCherry fluorescence and visualization of anti-YFV NS1 antibody binding using a PE-Cy7-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. The fraction of NS1-positive cells (GFP or mCherry) stained by MAb 1A5 or serum of JE-CVax-immunized mice (anti-mouse IgG) is given as a percentage in the upper right quadrant. Data from one representative experiment out of four independent experiments are shown.
