<p>Influenza viruses are members of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family of viruses, which are characterized by segmented, negative sense, single-stranded RNA genome. Of the influenza virus types, influenza A and B are the only types that are known to cause disease in humans. In addition to humans, influenza A viruses can infect a broad variety of species including pigs, horses, and birds (

For influenza A viruses, there are 18 known HA subtypes that fall into two phylogenetic groups (Group 1 or Group 2); like HA, the 11 NA subtypes also fall within two phylogenetic groups. These phylogenetic groups are composed of viruses that are derived from a common ancestor. Unlike influenza A viruses, the diversity of influenza B viruses is limited and is categorized into two lineages, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria (
