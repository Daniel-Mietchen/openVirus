<p>Influenza viruses predominantly infect and replicate in the epithelial cells lining the upper respiratory tract. Viral infection is initiated by the binding of viral surface glycoprotein HA to host sialic acid residues followed by internalization of the virus through endocytosis (

Ultimately, the activation of these innate sensing pathways leads to the production of interferon and cytokines/chemokines critical for efficient activation of adaptive immune responses (B- and T-cell responses) that help control and clear infection.
