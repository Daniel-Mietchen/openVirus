<p>Studies in humans and mice demonstrate the importance of T-cell responses in clearing primary influenza virus infection and mounting robust recall responses in subsequent infection. The importance of T-cell responses was highlighted by a study following 342 healthy adults in the UK during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which determined that illness was less severe in individuals with higher frequencies of pre-existing T cells to conserved CD8 epitopes (

 <sup>+</sup> T cells during influenza virus infection was further highlighted in adoptive transfer experiments in which mice were given CD8
 <sup>+</sup> effector cells. After infection, viral replication was reduced in the lungs of recipient mice compared to mice that did not receive CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (

 <sup>+</sup> T cells also displayed increased recruitment of NK cells, macrophages, and B cells after infection (

 <sup>+</sup> immune responses during infection. More recently, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells have also been shown to have an important role in clearing influenza infection, with the lack of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells correlating with reduced viral clearance (

 <sup>+</sup> T cells, adoptive transfer of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> memory T cells in mice was associated with greater protection during influenza infection (
