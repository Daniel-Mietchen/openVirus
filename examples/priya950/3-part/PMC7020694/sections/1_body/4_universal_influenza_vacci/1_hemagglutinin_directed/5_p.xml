<p>In recent years, vaccine approaches have attempted to enhance exposure of the HA stalk domain to the immune system using HAs that lack the dominant head domain (

Interestingly, when ferrets were immunized with the nanoparticle vaccine containing a full-length HA fused to ferritin, both HA stem and receptor binding site-specific antibodies were detected, demonstrating the utility of this approach in generating more broadly immunogenic HA-based vaccines (
