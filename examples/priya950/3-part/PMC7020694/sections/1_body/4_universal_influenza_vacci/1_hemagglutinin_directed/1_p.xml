<p>The influenza virus surface protein HA is one of the major targets of the immune system. HA is synthesized as a precursor HA0 that is proteolytically processed into HA1 and HA2 subunits, which remain attached through a disulfide bond. Three HA molecules form a trimeric rod-shaped molecule that is composed of a long fibrous stem formed by the HA2 trimer and a globular head formed by the HA1 trimer (

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Bullough et al., 1994</xref>). This process enables the release of the viral genomic contents into the cytoplasm. The HA1 region is highly immunogenic, more flexible to accommodate mutations than HA2 and displays a high degree of variability among influenza virus strains. Conversely, the HA2 region is highly conserved among different influenza virus subtypes and is more structurally constrained in its ability to accommodate mutations.
