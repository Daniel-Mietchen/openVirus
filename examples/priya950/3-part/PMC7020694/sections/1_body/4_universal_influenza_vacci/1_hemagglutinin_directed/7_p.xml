<p>Recently, the cHA vaccine has been further improved upon through the development of mosaic HAs (mHA), in which only the major antigenic sites in the HA head domain are exchanged with “exotic HA” sequences (

Additionally, transfer of sera from vaccinated mice into naïve mice provided protection against viral challenge with reassortment viruses containing PR8 internal proteins with HA and NA from different H3N2 strains as compared to the seasonal inactivated quadrivalent vaccine (
