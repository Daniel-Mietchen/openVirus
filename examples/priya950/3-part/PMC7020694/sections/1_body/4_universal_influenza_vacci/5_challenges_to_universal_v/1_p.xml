<p>An important question when discussing universal vaccine development involves defining the criteria for a successful universal influenza vaccine. Would a universal vaccine provide protection against all influenza A and B strains? Only influenza A or B? Or would the vaccine only provide universal protection within particular HA or NA subtypes? The route of administration should also be considered, especially when determining the durability of protection provided by the vaccine. Furthermore, many of the universal vaccine strategies described above require sequential vaccinations or boosters in order to achieve protection. Considering that individuals may be less likely to return to complete their vaccination regimens, this approach may have a negative impact on vaccine effectiveness from a public health standpoint. Likewise, sequential vaccination regimens with components that change at each booster vaccination may increase the likelihood of error during administration.</p>
