<p>An important challenge in inducing NA directed immune responses involves overcoming the immunodominance of HA over NA. In an attempt to subvert the HA immunodominance, a recent study generated two recombinant influenza viruses based on the H1N1 stain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) in which the NA stalk domain was extended by 15â€“30 amino acids (
