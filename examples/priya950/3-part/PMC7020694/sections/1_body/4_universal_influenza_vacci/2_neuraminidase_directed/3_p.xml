<p>There have been several approaches taken to develop NA-based vaccines, including use of recombinant NA proteins, DNA plasmid-based NA expression, and NA incorporation onto VLPs to boost NA-directed antibody responses (

Following vaccination with a MVA vector expressing N3 NA, mice were protected against challenge with H7N3 (

Additional studies in animal models that more closely recapitulate human influenza infection, like ferrets, are necessary to further examine the efficacy of this vaccine, but this study does provide more evidence for the importance of considering NA-based immune responses for influenza vaccines.
