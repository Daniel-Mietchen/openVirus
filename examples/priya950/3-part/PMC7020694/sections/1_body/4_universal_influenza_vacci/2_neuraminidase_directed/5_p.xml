<p>As with HA-directed vaccination approaches, these NA-directed approaches do not always demonstrate that protection elicited by the vaccine extends to both NA groups. Another consideration for NA-directed vaccines involves whether these approaches can provide robust protection in humans. As stated previously, NA-directed antibodies do not neutralize infection, and antibodies against NA have been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms in humans. As a result, more studies demonstrating protection in humans or models that more accurately reflect human influenza virus infection are necessary to demonstrate the protection these NA-based methods can provide.</p>
