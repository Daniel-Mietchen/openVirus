<p>Unlike HA antibodies, NA antibodies do not neutralize infection, but they have been shown to inhibit NA enzymatic activity as well as reduce viral titers in mouse models (

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of examining neuraminidase inhibition titers as well as hemagglutinin inhibition titers as a measure of influenza disease severity, suggesting that NA-based protection should be an important consideration when developing new influenza vaccines (
