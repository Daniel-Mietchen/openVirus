<p>Most T-cell-directed vaccine approaches involve targeting conserved internal influenza proteins or other highly conserved epitopes that stimulate T-cell-mediated immune responses. One such vaccine approach involved recombinantly expressing one B-cell epitope and two T-cell epitopes from H3 influenza strains in the flagellin of the 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> vaccine strain (
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Ben-Yedidia et al., 1999</xref>). After demonstrating the majority of the transplanted human cells in their human/mouse radiation chimeras were CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells, the recombinant vaccine was shown to elicit virus-specific antibodies and improved viral clearance after lethal challenge (
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Ben-Yedidia et al., 1999</xref>). In order to develop a more broadly protective vaccine, another study sought to identify conserved T-cell reactive regions by analyzing sequences from human and zoonotic influenza A and B viral proteins (
 <xref rid="ref105" ref-type="bibr">Stoloff and Caparros-Wanderley, 2007</xref>). The internal proteins M1, NP, and PB1 and the surface protein M2 were found to contain conserved T-cell reactive regions, with M2 and PB1 sharing conserved sequences in both influenza A and B isolates (
 <xref rid="ref105" ref-type="bibr">Stoloff and Caparros-Wanderley, 2007</xref>). Mice immunized with an antigen preparation comprised of the six conserved T-cell reactive regions, named FLU-v displayed increased CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell responses and improved survival following challenge with PR8 (
 <xref rid="ref105" ref-type="bibr">Stoloff and Caparros-Wanderley, 2007</xref>). While this study did not determine whether the vaccine provides protection against challenge with influenza B infection, it does further demonstrate the importance of stimulating CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells to generate protection against influenza infection. This vaccine is currently undergoing phase 2 clinical trials (
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein et al., 2019</xref>). Another conserved epitope vaccine undergoing clinical trials involving conserved T-cell and B-cell epitopes is the Multimeric-001 vaccine, which consists of nine conserved epitopes of HA, NP, and M1 from influenza A and B viruses (
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Atsmon et al., 2012</xref>). Healthy human volunteers vaccinated with the Multimeric-001 vaccine exhibited increased IgG titers against the Multimeric-001 vaccine component as well as increased IL-2 and IFNÎ³ secretion (
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Atsmon et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, sera from vaccinated subjects showed increased complement mediated lysis of infected MDCK cells (
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Atsmon et al., 2012</xref>). This measure was incorporated as an alternative to the hemagglutinin inhibition assay, which they were unable to use because the vaccine lacked the antigenic sites for neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Atsmon et al., 2012</xref>). While this study shows promise for inducing broad protection in humans, further challenge studies are needed to determine the efficacy of this vaccine.
