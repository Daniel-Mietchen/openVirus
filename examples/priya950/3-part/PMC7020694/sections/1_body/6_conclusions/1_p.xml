<p>Significant resources have been invested into the development of universal influenza virus vaccines and improved therapeutics for the treatment of influenza virus infection. Many universal influenza virus vaccine candidates focus on targeting conserved epitopes of influenza, including either the three influenza surface proteins or highly conserved internal proteins. In doing so, these approaches attempt to elicit broader protection against several strains of influenza as opposed to the strain-specific protection provided by current seasonal influenza vaccines. In attempting to generate a truly universal vaccine, which would offer protection against all influenza strains, these approaches have also highlighted innovative methods for improving current vaccination approaches. By providing protection for a broader range of influenza strains, these approaches have the potential to reduce the need for yearly vaccine reformulations. While influenza strains should still be closely monitored, broader protection against more influenza strains could aid in improving yearly vaccine efficacy. The development and discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies also illustrate the important contributions these therapeutics can offer in preventing and improving disease outcomes associated with influenza virus infection. Additionally, these studies have provided an insight into novel combinatorial approaches, as seen with studies combining M2e5x VLPs and HA-VLPs to improve vaccine immunogenicity or by combining broadly neutralizing antibodies with current antivirals to improve recovery from influenza virus infection (

While the ultimate goal of developing a truly universal influenza virus vaccine has yet to be achieved, the progress made in pursuit of this goal shows the exciting promise of these new approaches for improving influenza disease outcomes and as well as the public health burden associated with inefficient protection against influenza virus infection.
