<p>Given the considerable public health consequences associated with a lack of sufficient protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza stains, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has prioritized the development of a universal influenza vaccine that can afford protection against a broad variety of influenza viruses (

Currently, the majority of universal influenza vaccine research efforts are aimed at inducing immunity against the highly conserved regions on the influenza surface proteins or internal proteins of influenza viruses as means to induce universal protection against all influenza virus strains (
