<p>Yearly vaccination with split, inactivated influenza vaccines is still one of the most popular and efficient means of protection against seasonal influenza viruses. Prior to 2012, influenza vaccines were trivalent and contained only one influenza B virus in the vaccine. This often resulted in inadequate protection against influenza B virus, due to mismatches between the circulating influenza B virus lineage and the influenza B virus lineage chosen for vaccine incorporation (

Despite these improvements to the seasonal influenza virus vaccines, the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines can vary greatly, depending on how closely the vaccine strains match the circulating strains. In fact, there are several instances in the recent past where seasonal vaccines failed to provide protection against antigenically drifted strains (
