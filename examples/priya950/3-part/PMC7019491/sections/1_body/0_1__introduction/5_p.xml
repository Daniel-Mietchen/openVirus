<p>DIPs exert strong inhibitory effects on virus replication. Moreover, for a given concentration of DIPs in the infecting virus population, a large variation in the number of infecting DIPs per cell must be assumed, and a certain fraction of individual cells might not even become infected by a DIP. Most likely, this heterogeneity has a significant impact on cell-to-cell variability in progeny virus production.</p>
