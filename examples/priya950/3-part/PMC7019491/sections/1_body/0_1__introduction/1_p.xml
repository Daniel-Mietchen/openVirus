<p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause respiratory disease and are important human pathogens that can lead to a high morbidity. IAV epidemics occur annually, but occasionally severe pandemics can also arise. IAVs harbor a segmented and single-stranded RNA genome of negative polarity comprising eight individual viral RNAs (vRNAs) [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The vRNAs occur encapsidated with multiple copies of the viral nucleoprotein and the tripartite viral polymerase complex [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], forming so-called viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Upon infection and import into the cell nucleus, vRNPs are able to catalyze the transcription of viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs) as well as the synthesis of complementary RNAs, which are themselves encapsidated in complementary ribonucleoproteins that serve as a template for the replication of progeny vRNAs [
