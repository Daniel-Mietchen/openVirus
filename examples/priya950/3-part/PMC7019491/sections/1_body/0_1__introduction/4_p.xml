<p>At the single cell level, virus replication is highly heterogeneous and shows a vast cell-to-cell variability, with up to roughly 1000-fold differences in intracellular viral RNA levels and progeny virus yields [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Potential sources that have been discussed to affect or generate such a large heterogeneity are the cell size [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Moreover, whole-transcriptome analysis via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that, for instance, proteins involved in the transcriptional regulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocation, signal peptide processing and membrane trafficking, ubiquitination, oxidative and ER stress response, and mitochondrially encoded genes can further affect the strength of virus replication in a single cell [

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, not all causes of the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in virus infections have been identified, and a detailed comprehension of their complex dependencies remains largely elusive.
