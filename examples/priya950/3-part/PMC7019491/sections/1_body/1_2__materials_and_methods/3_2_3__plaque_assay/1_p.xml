<p>Complete single-cell-derived supernatants were subjected to the plaque assay to investigate the virus titer (PFU/cell). Specifically, we used two dilutions that comprised 90% and 10% of the sample. Adherent MDCK cells in 6-well plates were incubated with 250 ÂµL of each dilution for 1 h. Plates were rocked every 20 min to distribute the inoculum evenly. We then removed the inoculum, and well cells were overlaid with 1% of agar in an infection medium. After four days, cells were fixed with methanol, and stained with a 0.2% crystal violet solution. Plaques were then counted using standard light microscopy.</p>
