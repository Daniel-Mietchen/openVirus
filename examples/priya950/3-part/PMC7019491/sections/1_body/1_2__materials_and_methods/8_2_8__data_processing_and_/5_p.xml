<p>Salmon quantifies expression level by transcripts per millions (TPM), which includes the ERCC spike-ins. By removing the ERCC spike-ins and scaling the expression values to a million mapped reads, we obtained the expression level from the endogenous transcripts. Genes were filtered out, which were detected (TPM â‰¥ 1) in less than five samples.</p>
