<p>Single cell isolation was conducted as described previously [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Briefly, confluent MDCK cells (in 9.6 cm
 <sup>2</sup> dishes) were infected at an MOI of 10 in 250 µL of infection media. Cells were incubated for 1 h, and dishes were rocked every 20 min to distribute the inoculum evenly. Afterward, we increased the medium volume to 2 mL, and cells were further incubated for 1.5 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then the cells were quickly trypsinized for 10–15 min. The reaction was stopped using cell cultivation media (containing FCS), cells were homogenized, and diluted in infection medium. The diluted cell suspension was added to a 384-well plate (Greiner, Kremsmünster, Austria, #781901) to yield a calculated number of one cell per well (in 50 µL of medium). Incubation was conducted until 12 hpi. Cells were then briefly centrifuged at 150× 
 <italic>g</italic>, and single cells in individual wells were identified by phase-contrast microscopy. Single-cell supernatants were then subjected to plaque assays for quantification of the virus titers. Remaining single cells in the wells were washed twice with PBS. We then added 5 µL of lysis buffer, consisting of a bovine serum albumin solution (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, #B14), diluted to 1 mg/mL, and 1 U/µL RiboLockRNase Inhibitor (Thermo Scientific). The plate was then sealed and stored at −80 °C until single-cell RT-PCR or scRNA-seq.
