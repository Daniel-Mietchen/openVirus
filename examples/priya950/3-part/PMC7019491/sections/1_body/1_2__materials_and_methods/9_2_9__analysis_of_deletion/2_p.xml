<p>In order to identify the deletion junctions by their exact position, sequence alignment information of split or chimeric reads spanning the junction were used. To obtain the chimeric read information, we first ran STAR using the single-end mode for each read pair separately reducing the alignment artifacts. Next, the two Chimeric.out.junction output files were joined and chimeric reads spanning the junction were counted. Finally, we calculated the deletion junction distance considering the ambiguous split positions by merging chimeric reads with the same distance spanning the same locus with +/âˆ’ 3 bp difference. Regarding the viral bulk population, junctions were considered that had a distance &gt;1000 bp and covered by &gt;10 reads. For IAV-infected single cell experiments, we included junctions fulfilling the above condition or if junctions were detected in the viral bulk population. Read counts were normalized by counts per millions (CPM).</p>
