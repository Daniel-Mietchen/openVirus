<p>Absolute insert sizes of mate pairs mapping to PR8 were extracted from bam files. We calculated the log
 <sub>2</sub> ratios between the number of large insert sizes (&gt;1000 bp) and small insert sizes (&lt;=1000 bp) on PR8 S1, S2, and S3 with a pseudocount of 1 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup>, avoiding the logarithm of zero.
