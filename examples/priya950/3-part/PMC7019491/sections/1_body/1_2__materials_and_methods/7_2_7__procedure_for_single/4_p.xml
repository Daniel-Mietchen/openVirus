<p>Therefore, we used 1/5 of the recommended volumes: 2 µL of Tagment DNA (TD) buffer (2x), 1 µL of Amplicon Tagment mix were mixed with 1 µL of the cDNA and incubated for 4 min at 55 °C. Then, 1 µL of NT buffer was added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Adapter ligated fragments were barcoded and amplified by adding 3 µL Nextera PCR master mix, and 1 µL of each index 1 and index 2 primers by applying the following cycling protocol: 72 °C for 3 min, 95 °C for 30 s, 15 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final incubation of 72 °C for 5 min. Barcoded libraries were pooled and cleaned up using 0.6 volumes of AmpureXP beads. Beads were washed twice with 80% ethanol, eluted in 300 µL EB and a further cleanup was performed by adding an additional 180 µL of beads followed by two washes with 80% ethanol. Beads were resuspended in 100 µL EB. Quality controls were performed involving Qubit quantification (Thermo Fisher), Bioanalyzer size assessment (Agilent), and qPCR (Roche: KAPA library quantification kit). Sequencing was performed on a full lane of the Illumina HiSeq2500 system in PE50 mode.</p>
