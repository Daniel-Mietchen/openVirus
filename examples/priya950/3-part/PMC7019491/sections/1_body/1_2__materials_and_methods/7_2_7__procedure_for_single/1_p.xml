<p>The single-cell lysates (5 µL) were transferred to a 96-well plate, and subjected to a protocol for Smart-seq2 that allows for the generation of full-length cDNA and sequencing libraries, according to Picelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Briefly, 0.1 µL of 1:80,000 External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) RNA spike in controls, 1 µL of dNTPs (10 mM), and 0.1 µL of oligo-dT30VN (5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACT30VN-3′; 100 µM) were added to the 5 µL of cell lysate (on ice). The mixture was incubated for 3 min at 72 °C followed by 10 min at 10 °C. After hybridization of oligo-dT to the polyA tail, reverse transcription was performed: to each well a master mix containing 0.25 µL RNase-Inhibitor (40 U/µL; final amount/rxn 10 U), 3.4 µL SuperScript First Strand Buffer (5x; final amount/rxn 1x), 0.85 µL DTT (100 mM; final amount/rxn 5 mM), 3.4 µL Betaine (5 M, final amount/rxn 1 M), and 2.04 µL MgCl2 (50 mM; final amount/rxn 6 mM) were added. To start the reverse transcription, at the very last moment, 0.2 µL template switching oligo (TSO: 5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACATrGrG+G-3′) (100 µM; final amount/rxn 1 µM) and 0.7 µL of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (200 U/µl; final amount/rxn 140 U) were added and the following incubation program was started in a thermocycler with a heated lid: 90 min of incubation at 42 °C, 10 cycles of 50 °C for 2 min and 42 °C for 2 min, and 15 min of incubation at 70 °C for enzyme inactivation.
