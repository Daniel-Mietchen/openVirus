<p>For clean-up, 16 µL of Ampure XP beads was added and incubated for 8 min. After placement on a magnetic stand, the supernatant was discarded and the beads washed twice with 200 µL of freshly prepared ethanol. Beads were resuspended in 10 µL EB and after further incubation on the magnetic stand, the supernatant containing the DNA was used for library preparation following Illumina’s Nextera XT protocol. </p>
