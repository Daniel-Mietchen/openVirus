<p>Whole single-cell lysates (5 µL) were used for RT-PCR to investigate the presence of intracellular DI vRNAs. Specifically, we examined S1–S3, as DI vRNAs are typically predominantly generated on these segments. The procedure was based on a previously published method [

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], which can bind to the conserved 3′ end of every IAV vRNA, which facilitates the synthesis of all eight cDNAs in one reaction. For PCR, individual reactions for each segment were carried out. For this, the primers (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00071-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) encompass the 3′ or 5′ ends in conjunction with a segment-specific part of the vRNA, which enables the specific amplification of the complete vRNA segments.
