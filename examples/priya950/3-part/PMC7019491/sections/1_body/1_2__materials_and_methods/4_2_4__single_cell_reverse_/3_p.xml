<p>For PCR, 3 μL of the cDNA sample was mixed with 6 μL of 5× Phusion GC Buffer, 3 μL MgCL
 <sub>2</sub> (10 mM), 1.5 μL dNTPs (10 mM), 1.5 μL of each primer (10 μM), 0.6 U (equal to 0.3 μL) Phusion Hot Start II DNA Polymerase, and 13.2 μL nuclease-free water (all reagents from Thermo Scientific). PCR was initiated at 98 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 PCR cycles at 98 °C for 25 s, 58.5 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. Final elongation was performed at 72 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, agarose gel electrophoresis was used to visualize the PCR products.
