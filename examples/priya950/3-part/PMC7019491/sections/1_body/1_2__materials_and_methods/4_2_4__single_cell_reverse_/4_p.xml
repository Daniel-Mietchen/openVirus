<p>For quantification of the results from RT-PCR and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis, the image processing program ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used. More specifically, the software was used to quantify the signal intensities of the agarose gel images of the signals corresponding to the DI and FL vRNAs. For this, we (i) subtracted the background of the gel image, (ii) selected and transformed each band to a graph that displayed the grey value against the distance of the gel, and (iii) determined the area under the curve (AUC) of each band. Subsequently, all extracted AUCs of each band were normalized against the AUC obtained from a specific band (300 bp) of the DNA ladder. This was necessary for comparability of the numeric values obtained across different agarose gels. Subsequently, we calculated the quantity ratio of DI to FL vRNAs for each single cell by dividing the sum of normalized AUCs corresponding to DI vRNAs on S1–S3 by the sum of normalized AUCs belonging to the FL vRNAs on S1–S3.</p>
