<p>For RT, 1 µL of the single-cell lysate was combined with 0.5 µL of dNTPs (10 mM) and 0.5 µL of a random hexamer primer (100 µM), and filled up to 6.5 µL with nuclease-free water. Incubation was performed at 65 °C for 5 min and then 4 °C for 5 min. We then added 2 μL of 5x RT Buffer, 10 U (equal to 0.25 µL) RiboLock RNase Inhibitor, 25 U (equal to 0.25 µL) “Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase”, and 1 μL nuclease-free water (all reagents from Thermo Scientific). RT reaction was performed at 25 °C for 10 min and 50 °C for 30 min. Termination of the RT was conducted at 85 °C for 5 min. cDNA samples were either stored at −20 °C, or immediately subjected to qPCR.</p>
