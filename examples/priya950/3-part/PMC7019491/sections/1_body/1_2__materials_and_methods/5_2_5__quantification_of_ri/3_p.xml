<p>For qPCR, the Rotor-Gene Q real-time PCR cycler (Qiagen) was used and primers specific for 18S rRNA: “18S for” (5′-CGGACAGGATTGACAGATTG-3′) and “18S rev” (5′-CAAATCGCTCCACCAACTAA-3′). For this, we mixed 5 µL of the 2x Rotor-Gene SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen), 0.5 µL of each primer (10 µM), 1 µL of nuclease-free water, and 3 µL of cDNA sample. The following temperature profile was used for qPCR: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 PCR cycles of (i) 95 °C for 10 s and (ii) 62 °C for 20 s. Final denaturation was performed at 95 °C for 15 s. Subsequent melting curve analysis was conducted at temperatures between 65 to 90 °C.</p>
