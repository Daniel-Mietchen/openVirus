<p>Cell population-based experiments were conducted to investigate de novo generation of DI vRNAs. Specifically, we characterized the seed virus (used for infection) and the progeny virions released from the infected cells. For this, confluent MDCK cells in 6-well plates were infected at MOIs of 10 in 250 µL of infection medium. Cells were incubated for 1 h, where the plates were rocked every 20 min to distribute the inoculum evenly. Afterward, the inoculum was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS, and then 2 mL of infection media was added. At 12 hpi, aliquots of supernatants were stored at −80 °C until the purification of the vRNA of the released virus particles. Purification of vRNA of the released progeny virions and of the original seed virus was conducted using the NucleoSpin RNA Virus Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Afterward, we amplified the complete genome segments using the single-cell RT-PCR method (as described above), but with the following modification: for PCR, we used 5× Phusion HF Buffer (Thermo Scientific), and only 15 PCR cycles were performed. Moreover, besides S1–S3 vRNA, S4–S8 were also amplified (corresponding primers are listed in 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00071-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). All PCR reaction products of S1–S8 were pooled and then purified using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific).
