<p>A total of 100 ng DNA of amplicon DNA was sheared with the Covaris S2 system (duty cycle 5, intensity 5, 40 s). Sequencing libraries were generated using the KAPA HyperPrep DNA kit (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland): In brief, the fragmented DNA was end-repaired and dA-tailed. Adapters were directly ligated. Adapter-ligated DNA fragments were purified using magnetic beads. Applying three cycles of PCR, the library molecules were amplified using KAPAâ€™s HiFi HotStart ReadyMix. Resulting libraries were again cleaned up and subjected to intense quality controls involving Qubit quantification (Thermo Scientific), Bioanalyzer size assessment (Agilent, Santa Clara, California, U.S.), and qPCR (Roche: KAPA library quantification kit). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 system in PE50 mode targeting for two million fragments per library.</p>
