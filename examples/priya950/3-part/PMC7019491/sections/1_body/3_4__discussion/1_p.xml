 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We conducted single-cell analysis of IAV replication and reveal an association of DIP co-infections and single-cell progeny virus yields. Thus, differences in the content of DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs (observed between individual cells) may well contribute to the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in virus release. However, we also found a few exceptions from this observation, which may be explained by scarcely occurring DI vRNAs, which cannot interfere with standard virus (STV) replication for unknown reasons [
