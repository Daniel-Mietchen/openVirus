<p>Previously, single-cell virus replication under the influence of DIP co-infections has been studied in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected cells [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and IAV-infected cells [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], however, the latter study focused on the effect of DIP co-infections on the host cell response. In particular, an association between defective viral genomes and the stimulation of the innate immune response was observed [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Here, the authors instead co-infected VSV-infected cells with different multiplicities of DIP (MODIP). In line with our results, the authors observed a reduction and delay in VSV replication once co-infected with increasing MODIP [
