<p>Furthermore, we showed that high-yield cells harbor an elevated fraction of viral mRNAs as compared to low-yield cells. This observation is in agreement with a previous study, where we observed elevated levels of vRNAs in IAV-infected single cells showing high virus titers [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this context, it may be conclusive that a higher number of vRNAs leads to an elevated transcription of viral mRNAs, which, in turn, provide more templates for an enhanced translation of viral proteins that are required for virus particle production. Conversely, we found that the fraction of host cell mRNAs was decreased in high-yield cells. This was similarly observed for herpes virus-infected single cells [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Here, a higher cellular gene expression coincided with lower viral gene expression. It was speculated that specific host cell determinants are responsible for a supposed suppression of virus replication. Such determinants may be the innate immune response [
