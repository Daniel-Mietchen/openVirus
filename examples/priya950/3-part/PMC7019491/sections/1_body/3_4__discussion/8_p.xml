<p>Taken together, our results underline that elucidation of the origins of the high cell-to-cell heterogeneity in virus replication is a complex multi-parametric problem, where many different factors each exert an individual effect. In particular, we showed that DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs (interfering with virus replication), total level of viral mRNAs (facilitating the production of viral proteins), the fraction of host cell mRNAs (of which some factors may inhibit virus replication), but not the ribosome content, may have an impact on yields of a single IAV-infected cell. Nevertheless, it seems that various additional determinants remain to be elucidated. Overall, single-cell virology qualifies as a valuable tool to broaden our understanding of the vast cell-to-cell variability in virus replication.</p>
