<p>Furthermore, we observed a multifaceted single-cell variability in intracellular DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs that involved (i) the presence or absence, (ii) the load and (iii) the length, and (iv) the genomic segments on which the DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs occurred. Such a large heterogeneity may well reflect the virus-to-virus diversity in the DI vRNA content of individual DIPs in the infecting virus population. Alternatively, some DI vRNAs might have originated de novo during the infection. In particular, our results of single-cell RT-PCR and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis (
