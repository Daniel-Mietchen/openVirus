<p>Using the chimeric reads as a marker to identify different DI vRNAs, we observed 16 distinct DI vRNAs in the seed virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Strikingly, the number of different DI vRNAs increased to 141 in the progeny virions, implicating 125 de novo generated DI vRNAs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f005">Figure 5</xref>B shows the inferred lengths of DI vRNAs with respect to the expression level of DI vRNAs. We approximated the expression level of DI vRNAs by the normalized number of chimeric reads spanning the deletion junction. However, the number represents a lower bound for the expression level as read pairs mapping beyond the deletion junction cannot be technically distinguished between FL and DI vRNAs. We observed that DI vRNAs pre-existing in the seed virus became more abundant in the progeny virions, suggesting that they were amplified within a single cycle of high MOI infection, as to be expected for DIP propagation [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Accordingly, the apparently de novo generated DI vRNAs showed lower expression levels in the progeny virions. Moreover, all DI vRNAs contained breaking points situated ~250–400 bp apart from the terminal ends of S1–S3 (
