<p>Quality filtering based on library size and External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in accuracy yielded 86 single cells (45 low and 41 high productive cells) suitable for further analysis (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S1</xref>). Furthermore, we filtered out genes that were detected (transcripts per million (TPM) ≥ 1) in less than five samples, leading to a set of 2755 host cell genes. The remaining cells had an average host gene detection rate of 1381 genes (median 845 genes) per cell, which is an overall low detection rate in scRNA-seq [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This may be explained by the high viral transcriptional activity, likely suppressing host cell gene expression and dominating the cellular transcription by more than three orders of magnitude (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S5B</xref>). Interestingly, high-productive cells showed a significantly lower fraction of host cell mRNAs and significantly higher fraction of viral mRNAs compared to low-productive cells (Wilcoxon rank sum test

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S5C,D</xref>). Unfortunately, the signal for host cell expression was too low and noisy to perform reliable differential expression analysis for the identification of potential marker genes affecting IAV replication (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, the signal for virus-derived mRNAs was strong enough to allow for further analysis (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, we observed no correlation of the ribosome content of single cells with the virus titer. Moreover, scRNA-seq analysis showed that fractions of viral mRNAs were increased, and those of host cell mRNAs decreased in high-yield cells compared to low-yield cells.
