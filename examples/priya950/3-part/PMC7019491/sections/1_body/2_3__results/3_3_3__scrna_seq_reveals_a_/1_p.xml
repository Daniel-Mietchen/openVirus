<p>Sequencing library preparation protocols for scRNA-seq typically involve a step that removes ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As we hypothesized an impact of the ribosome content on single-cell virus replication, we performed real-time RT-qPCR of single-cell lysates to evaluate the rRNA levels. Specifically, we measured the 18S rRNA, which is bound to the small ribosomal subunit at exactly one molecule per ribosome [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Afterward, we calculated (for each single cell) the fold change over the average single-cell expression of 18S rRNA. Just like non-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00071">Figure S5A</xref>), we observed a huge cell-to-cell variability in the 18S rRNA content in infected cells, with differences in rRNA quantities that spanned more than four orders of magnitude (
