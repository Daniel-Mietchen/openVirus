<p>In order to identify additional factors that can contribute to the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in IAV replication, we next performed whole transcriptome analysis by scRNA-seq using Illumina-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Although similar studies have been conducted previously [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] including IAV-infected cells [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], only the viral mRNA level was used as a read-out to evaluate virus replication. In contrast, we also quantified the extracellular progeny virus yields, and thus, anticipated additional insights. To generate samples for scRNA-seq, we conducted three independent single-cell infection experiments yielding 210 single-cell samples. The corresponding distribution of the virus titer is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f003">Figure 3</xref>B. Here, we defined the “high” and “low” productive single cells based on the upper and lower 22.86% of cells (yielding each 48 samples) regarding their virus yield, respectively. Virus titers ranged from 1–40 and 330–1100 PFU for “low” and “high” productive cells, respectively. The single-cell lysates were then subjected to scRNA-seq.
