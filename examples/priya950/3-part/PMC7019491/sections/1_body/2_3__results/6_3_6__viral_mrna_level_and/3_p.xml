<p>Conversely, in the group of low-yield cells, we observed a subset of cells that nevertheless contained relatively high levels of total viral mRNAs. Intriguingly, these cells tested positive regarding the presence of DI mRNAs. These results suggest that, despite higher levels of viral mRNAs, the presence of DI mRNAs (indicative for DI vRNAs) likely resulted in interference with virus replication, and thus, a decrease in virus yield. Although not significant, a similar trend was observed in the group of high-yield cells where the cells containing a higher level of mRNAs, in turn, also tested positive for DI mRNAs. We concluded that the DI mRNA content and the level of viral mRNAs are both, independently from one another, connected with single-cell virus production.</p>
