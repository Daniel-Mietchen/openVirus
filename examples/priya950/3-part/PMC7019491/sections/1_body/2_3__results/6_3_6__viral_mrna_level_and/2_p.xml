<p>Indeed, we observed higher levels of viral mRNA in high-yield cells in each group of cells that were either negative or positive in DI mRNAs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f006">Figure 6</xref>). However, this difference was only significant in the group of cells that were positive in DI mRNAs, and not in cells negative in DI mRNAs. This might be explained by the low sample size in the latter group, which may have not provided enough statistical power. Nevertheless, it appeared that regardless of whether DI mRNAs were present or not, the total level of viral mRNA was correlated with the single-cell virus yield.
