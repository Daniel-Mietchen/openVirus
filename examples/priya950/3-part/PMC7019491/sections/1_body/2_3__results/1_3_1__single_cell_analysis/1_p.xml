<p>To investigate the cell-to-cell heterogeneity of IAV-infected cells with respect to their DI vRNA content, we performed single-cell analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). For this, we isolated influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8)-infected adherent Madinâ€“Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10) in 384 well plates utilizing a limiting dilution approach, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00071" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. At 12 h post infection (hpi), the virus yield in the supernatant of single cells was quantified using a plaque assay. Moreover, the single cells were investigated for the presence of intracellular DI vRNAs via RT-PCR. Here, the RT and PCR primers hybridize to the terminal end of vRNAs, which facilitates their complete amplification in RT-PCR (
