  <p>De novo generation of DI vRNAs. De novo generation was studied at the population and single-cell level. MDCK cells were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 10, and incubated until 12 hpi for cell population-based studies, or cells were trypsinized to facilitate single cell isolation (as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and incubation until 12 hpi. Seed virus vRNAs and vRNAs of progeny virions (produced in cell population-based infections) were analyzed by bulk RNA-seq. Single-cell intracellular viral mRNAs were investigated via scRNA-seq. Chimeric reads spanning the deleted region were used to identify the distinct DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs and to locate the deletion junction region (as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The pooled data of multiple independent experiments are depicted (
   <italic>n</italic> = 2 for population- and 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 for single cell-based experiments). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram showing the number of distinct DI vRNAs in the seed virus and progeny virions, and of DI mRNAs in single cells. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Diversity in DI vRNA sizes in the seed virus and progeny virions and their expression level. The expression level of DI vRNAs was approximated by the normalized number of chimeric reads spanning the deletion junction. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Distribution of deletion junctions of DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs. Start and end position of the deletion junction are marked on the corresponding segment.
