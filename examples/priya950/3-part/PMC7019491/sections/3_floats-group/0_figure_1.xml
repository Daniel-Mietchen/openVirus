  <p>Single-cell analysis approach and cell-to-cell heterogeneity in intracellular defective interfering (DI) viral RNAs (vRNAs). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the experimental procedure. Adherent Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were infected with influenza A virus (IAV) of strain A/PR/8/34 (PR8) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Afterward, the cells were trypsinized, serially diluted, and transferred to a 384-well plate. Single cells in individual wells were identified by phase-contrast microscopy. At 12 hpi, we quantified virus titers in the supernatant of single-cells using the plaque assay. The remaining single cells were lysed and investigated for the presence of intracellular DI vRNAs by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Illustration adapted from [

   <bold>B</bold>) Single-cell RT-PCR. DI vRNAs contain large internal deletions of varying lengths and junction points. In RT-PCR, both the RT and PCR primers bind to the terminal 3′ and 5′ ends of vRNA, which results in their complete amplification. In subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis, DI vRNAs occur as fragments of a reduced size in comparison to the FL vRNAs. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Intracellular FL and DI vRNAs of IAV-infected single cells. The virus yield of single cells is displayed at the top of the gels. The presence of DI vRNAs was investigated on S1, S2, and S3. The DNA ladder is shown at the left. A total of 39 single cells were analyzed of one representative experiment (out of six independent experiments).
