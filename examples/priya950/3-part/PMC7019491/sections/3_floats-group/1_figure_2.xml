  <p>Dependency of the single-cell virus yield on intracellular DI vRNAs. Single PR8-infected MDCK cells (MOI = 10) were investigated for the presence of DI vRNAs on S1–S3 by single-cell RT-PCR and released virus yields by plaque assay at 12 hpi (as shown 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00071-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The pooled data of six independent experiments are shown. n
   <sub>S</sub> indicates the number of single-cell measurements. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Histogram of the single-cell virus yield. Dashed line indicates the median of virus titer (60 plaque-forming units (PFU)). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Dependency of the virus yield on the quantity ratio of DI to FL vRNAs. The signal intensities of the DI and FL vRNAs from agarose gels were quantified using ImageJ. Afterward, the quantity ratios were calculated by dividing the sum of signal intensities of the DI vRNAs on S1–S3 by the sum of the signal intensities of the FL vRNAs on S1–S3. (
