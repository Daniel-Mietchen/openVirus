<p id="Par14">Zika virus (ZIKV) (family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) of humans and has been linked to congenital malformations and microcephaly in developing fetuses, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since its introduction to Brazil in 2015, ZIKV has spread into many new areas within the Americas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. ZIKV is transmitted primarily by urban and sylvatic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> serving as the main vector for human infection outside of Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This emerging mosquito-borne virus has caused epidemics throughout Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands and the Americas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Due to the lack of knowledge of ZIKV replication in North American mosquitoes, experimental vector competence studies are necessary to better understand the potential transmission of ZIKV by additional species. Recent studies have shown that some 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> mosquitoes from temperate regions of North America were not competent for ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], but this is a small representation of the species and strain diversity of mosquitoes that are found in the USA.
