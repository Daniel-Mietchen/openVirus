 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are the most important mosquito species responsible for virus transmission to humans in urban environments. Both species are competent vectors for ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The Asian rock pool mosquito, 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>, is a relatively new invasive species that can be found in subtropical and temperate regions of the USA. Although 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> is not an aggressive human biter, blood meal analysis from field collected mosquitoes have shown high incidences of human blood consumption [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Laboratory transmission studies show that 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> is a competent vector of WNV, La Crosse virus (LACV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes triseriatus</italic>, the principal vector of LACV, is found extensively throughout eastern USA and parts of Central America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Under laboratory conditions, 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic> is a competent vector for WNV, DENV, YFV, EEE and SLE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. WNV has been isolated from 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> and both species have been shown to be competent vectors of the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Laboratory transmission studies have found that 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> is refractory to CVV and ZIKV infections [
