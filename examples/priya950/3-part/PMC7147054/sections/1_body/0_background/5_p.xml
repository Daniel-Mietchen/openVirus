<p id="Par17">Between 2015 and 2018, there were more than 5000 imported ZIKV cases in the USA, with over 100 cases in Virginia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Within the continental USA, reports of local transmission by mosquito vectors have occurred in Florida and Texas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. There have been no human CVV cases reported in Virginia, but the virus has been isolated from field-collected 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> within the state [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although CVV has been detected in field mosquitoes, only a few transmission studies have been conducted to determine potential vectors for the virus. With the wide distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> throughout Virginia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], it is crucial to determine the vector competence of these local mosquito strains. In this study, we investigated the vector competence of Virginia mosquitoes common in urban and suburban environments for ZIKV and CVV to explore their abilities to contribute to potential outbreaks and help inform local mosquito control strategies.
