<p id="Par13">Vector-borne pathogens are a major public health concern and cause significant morbidity and mortality globally. In recent years, vector-borne pathogens have appeared in new regions, even as endemic diseases have increased in incidence. Human travel and trade are often responsible for the introduction of invasive pathogens but ecological factors such as climate and presence of competent vectors will determine whether the pathogen becomes established. For example, since its introduction in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) (family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus)</italic> is now the leading cause of vector-borne encephalitis in the USA [

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> are two of the most invasive mosquito species worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and both have been known to function as competent vectors for several enzootic mosquito-borne viruses in the USA [
