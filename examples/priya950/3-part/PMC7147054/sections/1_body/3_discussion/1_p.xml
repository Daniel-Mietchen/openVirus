<p id="Par28">Assessing the vector competence of local mosquitoes for imported and emerging viruses is critical for public health officials to anticipate patterns of arbovirus transmission, determine the relative roles of the different species for virus amplification and spread, and to select appropriate control responses. This study aimed to determine the risk of local ZIKV transmission and the emergence potential of CVV in Virginia by evaluating the vector competence of the most common mosquito species found in urban and suburban habitats.</p>
