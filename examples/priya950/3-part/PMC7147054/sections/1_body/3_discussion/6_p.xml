<p id="Par33">Outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases can have large economic and devastating impacts on human and animal health. Experimental vector competence studies allow us to understand the potential for a mosquito species to contribute to an outbreak and facilitate more targeted surveillance and control. Due to the wide variability of mosquito and virus infectivity, it is not possible to make the assumption that studies involving vectors from different geographical locations will have similar competencies. Therefore, it is not appropriate to extrapolate results from other studies for a single conclusion. Several studies clearly show considerable variability in the susceptibility of the same vector species for viral infection for DENV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], CHIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. In addition, when arboviruses are detected in field-caught mosquitoes, we cannot assume that it is competent and able to transmit the virus. The mosquito may have an undigested blood meal that was recently taken from an infected host, which can yield a false positive. Laboratory vector competence studies allow us to determine if a mosquito species is capable of transmitting the virus. When conducting laboratory vector competence studies, it is important to consider laboratory-reared 
 <italic>versus</italic> field-caught mosquitoes. For example, some vector competence studies have shown that laboratory-reared 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> is able to become infected and transmit ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], while studies using field populations were not able to transmit the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].
