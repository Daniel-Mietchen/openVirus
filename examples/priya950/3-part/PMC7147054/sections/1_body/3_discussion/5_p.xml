<p id="Par32">This study also found that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were susceptible to CVV infection and capable of virus transmission. The combination of high vector competence, previous isolations from the field, and anthropophilic behavior suggests that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> could play a major role in CVV transmission in endemic areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes triseriatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> were also competent for CVV and blood meal analysis has shown that all three species feed on deer, the primary amplifying vertebrate host for CVV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. We used high and low CVV blood meal titers that bracketed the range of titers found in experimentally infected deer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and showed that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were susceptible to CVV infection and subsequently transmitted virus even when exposed to low titer blood meals. There is currently no evidence of field isolation of the virus from 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, but the distribution of CVV includes the southern USA where 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is commonly found [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Even though CVV has been isolated from wild 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and this species has been shown to feed on deer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], it is unclear if it serves as a major vector in enzootic or local transmission of the virus. We also tested vector competence of field-caught 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> for CVV, and found no evidence of transmission by either species. The existence of a dose-dependent infection or escape barrier can determine how certain mosquito species and strains are refractory to infection. Studies looking at dose-dependent interactions between mosquito vectors and the virus typically find that high titers result in greater midgut infection and transmission potential while low titers result in low midgut infection and transmission rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The dose-dependent tissue barriers are often associated with midgut escape barriers or RNA interference (RNAi) pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], while incompatibility between the virus and cells of the midgut or salivary glands are dose-independent barriers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. With laboratory evidence of low titer vector competency and abundant distribution throughout North America, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic> could play major roles in CVV transmission.
