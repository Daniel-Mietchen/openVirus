<p id="Par30">Upon ingesting an infectious blood meal, the virus must surmount several tissue barriers associated with the midgut and salivary glands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. We assessed the presence of tissue barriers by intrathoracic inoculation of ZIKV. Injecting virus directly into the hemolymph bypasses the midgut and permits the virus to reach and infect the salivary glands. We detected infectious virus in salivary expectorant of 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>, but not 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus,</italic> which indicated the presence of salivary gland barriers. Although transmission for intrathoracically inoculated 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> was significantly higher than orally infected mosquitoes, the rates were low. The low midgut infection and transmission rates lead us to believe that there are potential midgut and salivary gland barriers that limit 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> and prevent 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic> from ZIKV transmission. Although 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was capable of ZIKV transmission after oral infection, intrathoracic inoculation significantly increased its transmission rates, indicating the presence of a midgut barrier. Studies of virus and vector systems have shown that these barriers play an important role during the extrinsic incubation period and may limit the ability of the virus to infect the mosquito for successful transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In addition, gut microbiota and immune pathways may also be involved when the virus enters the midgut [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that midgut and salivary gland barriers are responsible for the geographical variation in vector competence seen in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> for ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].
