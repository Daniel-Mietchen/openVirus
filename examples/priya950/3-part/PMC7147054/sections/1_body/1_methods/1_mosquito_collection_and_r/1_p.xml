<p id="Par18">All eggs were derived from female mosquitoes collected using gravid traps in forested areas around Blacksburg, VA. After laying eggs, adult mosquitoes were tested for arboviruses by Vero cell plaque assay to ensure the absence of virus in the F1 progeny. A laboratory strain of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Vero Beach, FL, was used as our reference vector species and was subsequently tested for CVV vector competence. Mosquitoes were reared in environmental chamber conditions set at 24 °C with 75% RH and 16L:8D photoperiod using methods by Jackson et al. [
