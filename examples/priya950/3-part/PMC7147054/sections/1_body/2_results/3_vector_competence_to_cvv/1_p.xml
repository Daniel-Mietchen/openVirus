<p id="Par27">When fed a high titer (ht) virus blood meal, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic> showed significantly higher rates of infection (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 127.5, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 5, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), dissemination (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 107.8, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 5,

 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 88.08, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 5, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) than 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> or 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). However, when fed low titer (lt) blood meals, there were no differences among rates for any of the species (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 5.61, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 3, 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was the most susceptible to CVV oral infection (ht: 100%, lt: 24%) and had the highest rate of dissemination (ht: 85%, lt: 24%) and transmission (ht: 68%, lt: 24%). 
 <italic>Aedes triseriatus</italic> was also susceptible to CVV infection (ht: 72%, lt: 15%), dissemination (ht: 69%, lt: 11%) and transmission (ht: 52%, lt: 7%). None of the 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> fed a low titer blood meal developed midgut infections. For 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>¸ CVV was able to establish midgut infections (ht: 48%, lt: 11%), cause a disseminated infection (ht: 25%, lt: 11%) and transmit virus (ht: 10%; lt:7%). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows significant differences in infection, dissemination and transmission between high and low titer blood meals for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic>. Virus titer resulted in significant differences in infection for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> but not dissemination or transmission rates. Neither of the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species was able to transmit CVV. No 
 <italic>Cx. restuans</italic> became infected and only one 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> was positive for infection and dissemination (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
