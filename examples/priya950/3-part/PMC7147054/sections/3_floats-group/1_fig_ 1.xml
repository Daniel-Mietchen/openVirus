  <p>Vector competence for ZIKV PRVABC59. 
   <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (

   <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic> (
   <italic>n</italic> = 28), 
   <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> (
   <italic>n</italic> = 73) and 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (
   <italic>n</italic> = 25) were provided infectious blood meals with an average titer of 2.57 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml (range = 5.75 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> to 7.5 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml). After 14 days, mosquitoes were dissected and the number infected (% mosquitoes with virus in the body), disseminated (% mosquitoes with virus in legs and wings, independent of infection status) and transmitting (% mosquitoes with virus in saliva expectorant, independent of infection status) were determined by Vero cell plaque assay. Different letters denote significance by two-tailed Fischer’s exact test and presented as mean % infected, disseminated and transmitting, α = 0.05
