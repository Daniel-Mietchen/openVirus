<p>Langsjoen et al., 2018 reported that Asian/American CHIKV strains are less virulent than those in the Asian, ECSA and West African genotypes and that despite differences in virulence, Indian Ocean Lineage-based vaccine strains offer a robust cross-protection against strains from other lineages [

In 2011, Partidos et al. reported that the importance of IFNs in controlling the CHIK 181/25 vaccine and demonstrated the ability of this vaccine to elicit neutralizing antibody responses that confer short-and long-term protection against wild type CHIKV-La Reunion challenge [
