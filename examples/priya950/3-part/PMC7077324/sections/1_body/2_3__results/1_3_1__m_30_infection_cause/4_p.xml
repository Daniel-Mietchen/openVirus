<p>These observations show that in A129 mice: (i) infections with high titers of both the M-30 and S-27 viruses caused fatal infections, indicating that high titer infections determine a lethal outcome; but (ii) under low titer infections, the M-30 infection caused high and acute fatality compared with the S-27 infection; and (iii) clinical signs relating to weight changes were clearly different between the M-30 and S-27 infections. These results suggest that the ECSA M-30 infection causes a more severe disease course than the classical prototype S-27 infection.</p>
