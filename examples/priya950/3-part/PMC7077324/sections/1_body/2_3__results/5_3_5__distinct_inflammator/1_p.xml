<p>To examine whether distinct inflammatory responses were induced in the M-30 and S-27 infections, the mRNA levels of major cytokines in the CNS (brain cortex) and peripheral (spleen) tissues were determined in both A129 mice infected with 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU of both viruses at 3 days pi and mock-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The levels of IFN-γ were significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0079) in the brains of M-30-infected mice than in those of the S-27-infected mice, and other cytokine levels in the brains were not significantly different between the M-30- and S-27-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). Levels of IFN- γ (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0118), IL-6 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0212), IL-10 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0079), IL-2 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0121) and IL-4 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0317) were significantly higher in the spleens of M-30-infected mice than in those of the S-27-infected mice, andTNF-α levels were not significantly different between the M-30 and S-27 infections (
