<p>To ascertain the cause of the different weight changes between M-30- and S-27-infected mice, food and water intakes were compared in AG129 mice infected with 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0013) weight ratios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) at 2 days pi. Interestingly, the food and water intakes of M-30-infected mice were similar to those of the mock-infected mice during 1 to 2 days pi, whereas those of S-27-infected mice were significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0047 in food intake, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0081 in water intake) reduced (
