<p>AG129 mice, which lack functioning type-I and -II IFN receptors, were also infected with high titer (10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu) or low titer (10
 <sup>2</sup> pfu) of the M-30 and S-27 viruses and their clinical courses were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f002">Figure 2</xref>). High titer infections with both viruses induced 100% fatality at 3 days pi (
