<p>In this study, we demonstrated that the CHIKV ECSA genotype M-30 has a higher pathogenetic potential than the African genotype S-27 in an in vivo mouse model. We suggest that this higher pathogenicity is associated with type-II IFN responses, as observed in the different fatality levels of A129 and AG129 mice.</p>
