<p>The sequence identities of nucleotides and amino acids between the M-30 and S-27 infections were 98.2% identical. Among the 60 amino acid differences, 26 structural proteins (three positions in C, 2 in E3, 15 in E2, 2 in 6K and four in E1) and 34 non-structural proteins (9 in NSP1, 6 in NSP2, 13 in NSP3 and 6 in NSP4), changes were identified. Previous studies have shown that the A226V mutation in the E1 protein identified in ECSA genotype strains increased its infectivity in human and mouse cell lines and contributed to more efficient dissemination and transmission by

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00169" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Only the M-30, and not the S-27 infection, has the specific A226V mutation in the genome. Although it is currently unknown whether a single or multiple viral genome mutation(s) contribute to the specific pathogenicity of ECSA CHIKV, determination of the viral genes responsible for higher pathogenicity in the M-30 genome in our mice model will provide potential clues to the viral factors of ECSA pathogenicity.
