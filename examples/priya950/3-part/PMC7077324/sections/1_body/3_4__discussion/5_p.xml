<p>High titers of both M-30 and S-27 infections in A129 mice proved fatal, whilst viral loads were considered to be sound predictors of a lethal outcome. In A129 mice infected with low titers, viral loads in the peripheral and CNS tissues were significantly increased in M-30-infected mice compared with S-27-infected mice. In addition, following infections with both M-30 and S-27, viral loads in AG129 mice were substantially higher than those in A129 mice. These observations indicate that viral loads are closely correlated with severe pathogenicity and fatality in mice. However, it is unclear whether viral proliferation is a cause or a result of severe diseases caused by fatal infection. In A129 mice, different inflammatory responses were observed following infections with low titers of M-30 compared with S-27. These immune responses were detected via mRNA levels of IFN-γ in the brain and of IL-6 and IL-10 in the spleen and protein levels of IL-6, MCP-1 and TNF-α in the plasma. Thus, we suggest that those distinct inflammatory responses may be correlated with severe pathogenicity and fatality in mice. However, currently, it is unclear whether these responses have a protective or promotive effect on viral proliferation or whether they are a cause or a result of severe diseases caused by fatal infections. Further analysis is required to answer these questions which may provide useful information to help elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of CHIKV infections.</p>
