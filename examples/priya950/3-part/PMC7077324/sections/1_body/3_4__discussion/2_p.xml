<p>Interestingly, M-30-infected mice did not experience hypophagia or weight reductions. As far as we know, this phenomenon is unique among the clinical signs that have been observed in viral infections because pathogenic virus inoculations usually induce weight loss in the experimental mice models during disease development. From our experience, we also consider that weight reduction is an important key factor in the pathogenicity of viral infections [

Therefore, our established mouse model of CHIKV infections may provide a novel concept of the pathogenic mechanism related to metabolic activity and viral infections.
