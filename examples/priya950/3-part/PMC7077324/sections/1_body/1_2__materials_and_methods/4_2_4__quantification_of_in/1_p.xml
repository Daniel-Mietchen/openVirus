<p>As discussed above, following CHIKV infection, the mice were sacrificed and their spleens and brains were collected after perfusion. Those tissues were immediately submerged in RNAlater (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Transcribed mRNA levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α were examined using a SYBR real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as demonstrated previously [
