<p>The A129 and AG129 mice subcutaneously inoculated with 10
 <sup>5</sup> and 10
 <sup>2</sup> pfu of M-30 and S-27 were euthanized and sacrificed. The blood was collected and after perfusion with cold phosphate-buffered saline, the thymus, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, kidneys, muscle, brain, and spinal cord were also collected. The brains were divided into two parts: the brain cortex (brain-1) and other parts (brain-2). Both parts were kept at –80°C until further use. Each tissue was homogenized and virus titers were determined by plaque-forming assays in cells and were expressed as pfu/g tissue [
