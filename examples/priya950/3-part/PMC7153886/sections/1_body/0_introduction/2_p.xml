<p>Influenza infection is a common illnesses and annual incidence of infection is not captured accurately by routine surveillance methods such as laboratory-confirmed infections, and thus true estimates of morbidity and mortality attributable to influenza is not known [

Although influenza typically causes acute respiratory illness, it can also contribute to, or exacerbate, other severe acute or chronic illnesses. Therefore, statistical approaches to estimating morbidity and mortality attributable to influenza infection, aim to determine the portion of broader categories of outcomes or diagnoses than just influenza. Typically, a respiratory diagnosis such as influenza combined with pneumonia, all respiratory, and non-respiratory such as all cardiovascular and all-cause diagnosis groups are considered to estimate influenza-attributable illnesses for burden of disease studies [
