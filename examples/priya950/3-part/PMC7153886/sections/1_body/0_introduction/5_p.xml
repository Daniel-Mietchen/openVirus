<p>The majority of Australia’s population lives in a temperate zone, and overall influenza occurrence is moderately seasonal [
 <xref rid="pone.0230705.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Due to the changing epidemiology of influenza and varied influenza vaccine effectiveness from season to season, estimates of burden of influenza infection need to be updated frequently to inform effective influenza prevention and vaccination programs as well as to provide data for cost effectiveness studies. Our study aims to estimate total hospitalisations attributable to seasonal influenza and for the pandemic year, 2009 by virus type and age in Australia. This study would provide recent estimates of influenza-attributable hospitalisations in Australia for the period July 2001 –December 2013.
