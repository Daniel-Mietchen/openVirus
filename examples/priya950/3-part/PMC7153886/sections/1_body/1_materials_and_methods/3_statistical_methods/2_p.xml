<p>To estimate the separate effect of influenza types A and B, weekly notification counts of each type were entered into the model, with a separate independent variable for each influenza type included for each year. For a given year, these variables included notification counts for that year, but counts were set to zero in all other years. This allowed us to control for substantial variation over time in influenza testing practices by healthcare providers, as well as variation from year to year in virulence of viral strains, vaccination coverage or vaccine effectiveness.</p>
