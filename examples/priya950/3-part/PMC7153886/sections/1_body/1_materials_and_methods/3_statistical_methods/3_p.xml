<p>We examined the data for holiday periods using box whisker plots of the distribution. Holidays included were Christmas Day, New Yearâ€™s Day, Australia Day, Easter, and ANZAC day. Other holiday periods were a week before Christmas, a week before Easter, and two and three weeks after the New Year, which are within the main summer school holiday period in Australia. A separate indicator time series variable was created for each holiday valued at 0 for a non-holiday week and 1 for a holiday week.</p>
