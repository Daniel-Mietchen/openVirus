<p>For the smoothing spline of week number, we used a total of 79 degrees of freedom (DF), which includes 6 turning points in a year for the flexibility of the smoothing spline plus an additional 1 DF for linear term in the model. This a priori choice of degrees of freedom was based on providing a smoother of time that provided a balanced approach. It is longer than the time scale of weekly influenza-attributable variation that we are interested in, while conservatively limiting autocorrelation in the model residuals. Limiting autocorrelation improves the ability of the model to meet the assumption of independent residuals.</p>
