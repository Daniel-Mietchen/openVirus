<p>The estimated influenza-associated weekly hospitalisation rate in each disease category and age group was calculated by multiplying the corresponding parameter estimates by the number of influenza notifications (both A and B and total) in the week. Weekly influenza-attributable count estimates were obtained by multiplying weekly rate estimates by the population estimate in that week. Annual total rates and counts were calculated from the weekly estimates.</p>
