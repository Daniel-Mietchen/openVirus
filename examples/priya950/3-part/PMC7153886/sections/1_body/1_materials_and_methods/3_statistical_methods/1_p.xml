<p>Semi-parametric generalised-additive models (GAM) with a smoother of time were used to model weekly age-specific hospitalisation rate per 100,000 population (outcome) with weekly counts of all-age influenza notifications as an independent variable. The choice of GAM over ordinary parametric regression with harmonic (sinusoidal) smoothers was chosen because harmonic models with sinusoidal seasonality require an assumption that background variability in the hospital time series is perfectly seasonal. The harmonic approach requires an assumption that all diseases other than influenza that contribute to the hospital time series are perfectly seasonal. Using a more flexible smoother of time relaxes this assumption. This may also lead to better control of autocorrelation in model residuals meaning that the modelling assumption of independent residuals is better met. GAM has been applied in several studies of infectious disease outcomes, including influenza [
