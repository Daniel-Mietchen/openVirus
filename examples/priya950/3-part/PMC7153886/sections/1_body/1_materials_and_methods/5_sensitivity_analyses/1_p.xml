<p>We conducted two sensitivity analyses. First, we tested the effect of altering the flexibility of the spline, running the GAM with each of 4 (less flexible) and 8 knots (more flexible) per year for the all-age respiratory hospitalisation category by influenza type. Second, we examined the difference in estimates that would be obtained using a more conventional harmonic ordinary linear regression model with annual sinusoidal seasonal time smoothing for the all-age respiratory hospitalisation category by influenza type.</p>
