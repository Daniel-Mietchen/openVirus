<p>Many epidemiological studies reported that the incidence of influenza B is higher in children than older adults [

 <xref rid="pone.0230705.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Since those studies relied on the results of influenza testing, they may be subject to testing bias, and may not reflect the increasing risk of hospitalisation with age. On average influenza B accounted for around 17% of seasonal influenza notifications in Australia [

Our study estimated that influenza B, on average, accounted for about 42% of all-age seasonal influenza-attributable respiratory hospitalisations. The use of quadrivalent vaccines that include two influenza B virus lineages may be beneficial in reducing the burden of influenza B in Australia [
