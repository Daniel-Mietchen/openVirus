<p>We estimated that from 2001 through 2013, seasonal influenza was associated with an average annual, all-age respiratory hospitalisation rate of 77 per 100,000 population, of which influenza B accounted for 42% of the rate. For influenza and pneumonia hospitalisations, the rate was about 32 per 100,000 and influenza B accounted for 28% of that rate. Rates for both disease categories were lowest in 15–64 year-olds, and increased with age, with the highest rates in ≥85 year-olds. Rates in children for both principal diagnosis categories were almost double that of 15–64 year-olds. Collinearity between influenza A and B surveillance time series in several years limited the models’ ability to resolve influenza type-specific contributions to the hospital burden particularly in children.</p>
