<p>The previous Australian study included only total influenza-attributable hospitalisations, thus influenza type-specific comparisons could not be made [

 <xref rid="pone.0230705.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While the results of the US study cannot be compared directly due to differences in study timing, diagnosis category and statistical methods used, results were broadly similar for all-age hospitalisations attributable to total influenza: 64 per 100,000 population for respiratory and 35 per 100,000 population for influenza and pneumonia. The US study reported a lower all-age rate of influenza B-attributable respiratory hospitalisation (16 versus our 33 per 100,000 population) and a similar rate for influenza and pneumonia (7 versus our 9 per 100,000 population) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230705.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The UK study reported an average annual, all-age seasonal influenza A-attributable respiratory hospitalisation rate of around 44 per 100,000, almost identical to our finding. Their influenza and pneumonia finding of 12 per 100,000 was around half our estimate [
