 <xref rid="pone.0230705.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. During these years, our study showed increased respiratory hospitalisation rates in adults aged 65 years and over attributable to influenza A or total influenza. Our study showed that the 2003 influenza season was the worst season for hospitalisations among the years studied. Consistent with other studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0230705.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], hospitalisation rates per 100,000 population for seasonal influenza were high among older adults in our study, with the highest rates in persons aged ≥85 years. This is in contrast to laboratory-confirmed notifications data from the Department of Health, which show higher frequency in children compared with other age groups [
