<p>Varying the number of knots to 4 or 8 per year in the smoothing spline or using a harmonic ordinary linear regression model produced estimates for average annual, all-age influenza A- and B-attributable respiratory hospitalisation rates with overlapping confidence intervals (

The autocorrelation plots for 4 knots/year smoothing showed weak but statistically significant positive, first order autocorrelation with 4 knots/year, which became weaker but still significant for 6 knots/year and minimal and non-significant with 8 knots per year. However, with 8 knots/year, some weak, significant higher order negative correlations were observed. With the harmonic model, moderate first order and weak second order autocorrelation were apparent (
