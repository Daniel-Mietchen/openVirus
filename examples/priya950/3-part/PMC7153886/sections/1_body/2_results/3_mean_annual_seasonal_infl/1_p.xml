 <xref rid="pone.0230705.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the estimated annual average hospitalisation rates per 100,000 population and counts by virus type, principal diagnosis and age group over the study period, excluding the 2009 pandemic year. For all-age respiratory hospitalisations, the annual average total influenza-attributable population rate was 76.9 (95% CI: 73.6, 80.2) per 100,000. The rates for influenza A and B were 45.4 (95% CI: 34.9, 55.9) and 32.6 (95% CI: 22.8, 42.4) per 100,000, respectively. Influenza B accounted for 42% of the estimated all-age total influenza rate. By age group, the highest estimated rate of total influenza-attributable hospitalisation per 100,000 was 510.3 (95% CI: 484.8, 535.8) in persons aged ≥85 years. The rate per 100,000 declined with age to 43.5 (95% CI: 41.4, 45.5) in 15–64 year-olds, and increased again to 76.9 (95% CI: 66.8, 87.1) in &lt;15 year-olds. Graphs for all-age, estimated average annual rate of influenza-attributable hospitalisations from influenza and pneumonia and respiratory diagnosis categories, using influenza A and B model and the total model are also presented in the (
