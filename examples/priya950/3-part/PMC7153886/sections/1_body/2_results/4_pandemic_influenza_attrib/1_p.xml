<p>For the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic year of 2009, hospitalisation rates of 56.1 (95% CI: 47.4, 64.9) and 38.9 (95% CI 36.8, 41.0) per 100,000 were estimated for respiratory and influenza and pneumonia principal diagnosis groups, respectively. Pneumonia and influenza principal diagnoses accounted for 69% of the all-age respiratory hospitalisation rate. Hospitalisation rates were highest in persons aged ≥85 years, with 323.9 (95% CI: 256.2, 391.6) per 100,000 for respiratory and 125.5 (95% CI: 87.8, 163.2) per 100,000 population for influenza and pneumonia. The respiratory estimate for 0–14 year-olds was not statistically significant, but the influenza and pneumonia estimate was significant, at 41.4 (95% CI: 37.3, 45.5) per 100,000 (
