 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230705.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</xref> showed a time series of type- and age-specific influenza-attributable influenza and pneumonia and respiratory hospitalisation rate per 100,000 population. Over the 13 influenza seasons, influenza A-attributable both influenza and pneumonia and respiratory hospitalisations were most distinct in 2003, 2009 and 2012. Similarly, relatively higher influenza B-attributable respiratory hospitalisations were seen in 2008 and 2013. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230705.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</xref>, darker red areas reflect negative estimates of influenza A or B from the model. There was collinearity between influenza A and B time series in some years that limited the ability of the model to resolve differences in influenza attribution between the two virus types. For influenza A, this occurred in 2008, 2011 to 2013, and was more pronounced in &lt;15 year-olds. For influenza B, this was pronounced in 2011. Time series graphs of age-specific total influenza-attributable hospitalisation rates for influenza and pneumonia, and respiratory are described in
