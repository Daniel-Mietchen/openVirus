There was great variation from year to year, and increased notifications were seen especially in the post-pandemic (post-2009) years. The highest number of influenza A notifications was during the pandemic year 2009, while influenza B reached its highest counts in 2012 and 2013. For influenza A, the highest annual mean count was 1123 in 2009 and the lowest counts was 30 in 2004. For influenza B, the highest annual mean count was 203 in 2012 and the lowest was 2 in 2004 (
