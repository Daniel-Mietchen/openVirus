<p>Smallpox was a widespread disease in humans caused by the variola virus, which is a member of the poxvirus family [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Smallpox was declared eradicated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980, following successful vaccination campaigns and other favorable conditions [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, smallpox poses a public health threat of re-emergence due to the absence of mass vaccination, waning immunity and advances in synthetic biology, which make synthesis of variola possible [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Two distinct phenomena of airborne transmission are described with variola—firstly, direct person-to-person transmission by the airborne respiratory route, and secondly, transmission over greater distances, sometimes over a mile, referred to as “aerial convection” [
