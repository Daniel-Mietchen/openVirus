Introduction</title><p>Smallpox was a widespread disease in humans caused by the variola virus, which is a member of the poxvirus family [<xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Smallpox was declared eradicated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980, following successful vaccination campaigns and other favorable conditions [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, smallpox poses a public health threat of re-emergence due to the absence of mass vaccination, waning immunity and advances in synthetic biology, which make synthesis of variola possible [<xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Smallpox transmission occurs from person to person, primarily through respiratory droplets but can also transmitted through contact with infected clothing and bedding [<xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The R0 is estimated to be around 5 [<xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Whilst most pathogens have a dominant mode of transmission, they usually have more than one mode of transmission, and quantifying the relative contributions of different modes of transmission in the spread of an infection is difficult [<xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Two distinct phenomena of airborne transmission are described with variola&#x02014;firstly, direct person-to-person transmission by the airborne respiratory route, and secondly, transmission over greater distances, sometimes over a mile, referred to as &#x0201c;aerial convection&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>It is believed that variola virus can transmit through the airborne, aerosol and contact routes, and some cases of indirect spread via fine particle aerosols or fomites have been reported [<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The risk of person-to-person airborne infection is a function of the virus concentration in respiratory fluid, the expiratory event rate, the size and volume distribution of the particles emitted per expiratory event, the receptor&#x02019;s breathing rate, exposure duration, and the receptor&#x02019;s location in the room relative to the source case [<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There have been various experimental studies on animals, which confirm that infection can be produced by a single plaque-forming unit (PFU) of virus carried in respirable particles&#x02014;even a submicrometric aerosol of variola can cause infection in animals [<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Smallpox can be transmitted through aerosols and the airborne route, as evidenced by air-sampling techniques together with culture and molecular detection methods [<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There is also evidence showing the association between ventilation and the control of airflow directions in buildings and the transmission of infectious diseases [<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Airborne transmission accounts for at least 10% of all nosocomial infections, based on patient-based surveillance systems and environmental sampling techniques in hospital settings [<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Smallpox can survive in the environment under certain conditions and contaminated particles may be still isolated from the air in the later stages of the disease corresponding to a smaller number of lesions [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thomas (1974) recovered the smallpox virus from an isolation unit using an adhesive surface air-sampling technique in the presence of very low aerosol concentrations [<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A review of the literature suggests that the role of airborne transmission may have been underestimated in many instances [<xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In addition to direct respiratory transmission from person to person within 1&#x02013;2 m of spatial separation, a more distant transmission has been described. Whilst it is well-established that airborne infection can occur [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the spread of smallpox by means of &#x0201c;aerial convection&#x0201d; is less well understood. Aerial convection refers to transmission over a substantial distance, (greater than expected during direct person to person respiratory transmission of 1&#x02013;2 metres and possibly aided by wind or air currents) a concept accepted by many epidemiologists. In recognition of this, the Ministry of Health regulations in Britain in the 1940s stipulated that smallpox hospitals should be &#x0201c;at least a quarter of a mile from another institution or a population of 200, and at least a mile from a population of 600&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Aerosol transmission can occur over short distances or long distances, and the transmission is primarily governed by air flows driven by pressure differences generated by ventilation systems, open windows and doors, movement of people or temperature differences [<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Aerosolised particles have the potential to remain suspended in the air for hours and can expose a larger number of susceptible individuals to potential infections at a greater distance from the source [<xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our understanding of respiratory transmission and measurement methods have improved substantially since eradication [<xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which makes it timely to review the evidence. Now 40 years since clinicians and public health agencies have managed smallpox, there is a need to review the pre-eradication human evidence around smallpox transmission, especially the role of aerial convection, for which there is little awareness among contemporary clinicians. This is essential to inform disease control strategies and health care worker occupational safety in preparedness planning.</p><p>The aim of this paper was to study the data and epidemiology of transmission of variola by aerial convection, and examine the hypothesis that aerial convection was only observed when the incidence of smallpox is sufficiently low to exclude other sources of infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-12-00033"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>Given the phenomenon of aerial convection was observed in the last 100 years of smallpox endemicity in the world, we examined the incidence of smallpox using the best available data, in relation to the period of observation of aerial convection. We used the systematic review methodology to identify data and evidence for aerial convection, and then analysed incidence data, documented distances of transmission, and the period of observation of aerial convection in relation to the epidemiology of smallpox deaths.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-viruses-12-00033"><title>2.1. Smallpox Data Analysis</title><p>In order to clearly demonstrate the window during which aerial convection was observed relative to the epidemiology of the disease, we created the timeline of all identified observations of aerial convection that was plotted over the number of smallpox deaths using available data in London from 1700&#x02013;1980. London was selected because there was better data for deaths (than cases) than global data or other countries, and the largest number of observations of aerial convection were from England.</p><p>We collected the data of the annual number of deaths from smallpox in London from 1700 to 1902 [<xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Due to missing data on deaths in London between 1903 and 1958, we collected the available data to estimate data for London, including (1) the number of deaths from smallpox in England and Wales from 1911 to 1919 [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], (2) population in London, England and Wales in 1911 (26), (3) number of cases and case fatality rate in the UK from 1920&#x02013;1958 [<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and (4) the number of deaths in London between 1959 and 1980 [<xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>We estimated that the annual deaths in London were 13% of deaths in England and Wales between 1911 and 1919, according to the population in London (4.52 million) taking 13% of the population in England and Wales (36.07 million) in 1911 [<xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Using the case fatality rate of 30% [<xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we calculated the annual number of deaths in the UK from 1920 to 1958 based on the yearly reported cases [<xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The annual deaths in London were 17% of deaths in the UK between 1920 and 1958, according to the population in London (7.39 million) [<xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] taking 17% of the UK population (43.90 million) in 1921 [<xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The deaths in London between 1958 and 1980 were extracted from documented smallpox outbreaks in the UK [<xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These different data sources were used to create a timeline of smallpox deaths in London from 1700&#x02013;1980. Then we plotted all identified observations of aerial convection over this timeline, to show the relationship of this observation period of aerial convection to the epidemiology of smallpox and the waning incidence of smallpox.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-viruses-12-00033"><title>2.2. Search Strategy</title><p>A systematic review was conducted on finding evidence for aerial transmission of smallpox. Our review focused on identifying smallpox outbreaks occurring in humans and studying the reported transmission pattern to find evidence of aerial convection spread. Specifically, we looked for cases where people acquired smallpox in the vicinity of, but at a distance of &#x0003e;2 m from a known smallpox case. We searched five databases: Medline (1946 to present), Embase (1974 to present), Scopus (1960 to present), Web of Science (1898 to present), Global Health (1910 to present). Results were limited to peer-reviewed publications in English. Search terms used were &#x0201c;smallpox&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;variola&#x0201d; AND &#x0201c;transmission&#x0201d; AND &#x0201c;outbreak&#x0201d;. We also reviewed the bibliography of retrieved articles to identify other references that might not otherwise have been identified. Secondary searches were conducted which included the cross-references from various relevant papers. Author AD independently screened each title and abstract in the search result and in case of uncertainty, the author (CRM) was consulted. A full-text evaluation was conducted by three review authors (CRM, AD and XC). The results from our review are presented in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, which is the accepted standard for a systematic review (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00033-f001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-viruses-12-00033"><title>2.3. Selection Criteria and Inclusion</title><p>We focused on the aerial transmissibility of smallpox in outbreaks and on the evidence of transmission route from analysis of relevant outbreaks. Eligible studies had to fulfil the following criteria: (1) Peer-reviewed journal articles, (2) published in English, (3) primary focus on smallpox outbreaks in humans, (4) outbreak case studies showing evidence of transmission at distances &#x0003e;2 m in the absence of known smallpox transmission in the surrounding community, (5) studies on variola major or variola minor.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-viruses-12-00033"><title>2.4.

(2) Laboratory experiments and studies unrelated to transmission route of smallpox, (3) non-human studies, (4) mathematical modelling studies, (5) studies focussing on smallpox eradication or vaccination, and (6) studies focusing on vaccinia virus.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-viruses-12-00033"><title>2.5.

Results</title><p>We identified 22 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, which described 17 different outbreaks. The outbreaks with evidence of transmission route from the selected studies are summarized in <xref rid="viruses-12-00033-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Eight outbreaks involved very long-range transmission beyond a single building or location and nine involved transmission within a building that could not be explained by direct person to person contact.

This ranged from half a mile (0.8 km) to over 9 miles (15 km) in the case of the Aralsk outbreak.

One was of very long-range transmission over distances of a half-mile to a mile. This comprised single source cases and a secondary case occurring at a long horizontal distance, or clustering of cases in the community within a radius around a smallpox hospital (building or ship). The second was transmission within a building (often vertically from one floor to another) or between adjacent buildings in the absence of relevant contact with an infected case. The Birmingham case [<xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the Meschede outbreak [<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and the New York outbreak [<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] showed transmission from one floor of a building to another, suggesting air currents can carry virus either through the air conditioning systems or through open windows. One study supporting aerial convection of variola is the controlled experimental work conducted in the Meschede, Germany outbreak via smoke flow visualisation [<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These results clearly revealed that the airflow patterns matched the location of cases within buildings. At the time, however, such studies were limited, and emphasis was placed on trying to explain transmission by other modes of transmission.</p><p>The second pattern was long-distance horizontal transmission from one site to another of a mile or more, as seen in Fulham [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], Salonika [<xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], Gravesend [<xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and Purfleet [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], among others. The Fulham data are particularly convincing because of the painstaking collection of data and mapping of smallpox cases in proximity to hospitals, and the fact that the initial observations in Fulham were reproduced around the country. [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] The observations from the smallpox ships in the Thames and recurrent epidemics in the nearest communities to shore were also supportive. An outlier case was that of the Lev Berg ship in the Aral sea. In this instance, it is likely that the official reports (which state the index case got off the ship at several stops) was an obfuscation of the truth, and that the comments of Dr Pyotr Burgasov after the collapse of the Soviet Union (that a 400 g smallpox &#x0201c;bomb&#x0201d; was exploded on Vozrozhdeniye Island) were closer to the truth [<xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The Lev Berg sailed 15 km off the coast of Vozrozhdeniye Island, which was a known Soviet biological weapon testing site. It seems likely this was the source of infection, and possible that a weaponised attack may disperse the virus at least 15 km.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-12-00033"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Understanding smallpox transmission is crucial for preparedness planning and can inform control of a re-emergent epidemic of smallpox. It was accepted that variola was most effectively transmitted by the respiratory route, and it was formerly called a &#x0201c;preferentially&#x0201d; airborne infectious disease&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Variola virus has been recovered in airborne droplets from air sampling, supporting aerosol transmission [<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The observation of aerial convection in a number of outbreaks further supports airborne transmission. Aerial convection, however, was more controversial and is not a concept that is currently in the corporate memory or included in hospital infection control protocols. We found supportive evidence of aerial convection from 12 out of 17 outbreaks, and a further 5 outbreaks which were partially conclusive. The examples of transmission from one floor to another or one building to another, presumably by air currents, are more easily explained, as distances were shorter and supported by the smoke experiments at Meschede, Germany [<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the last documented case of smallpox in the world, the Birmingham case, we can be fairly certain the patient was infected from a virus in the laboratory. Case ascertainment was high at that time, the location was the UK, which had long since eliminated smallpox, so it is likely the source of infection was an aerosolised virus through air-conditioning dust or an open window. More recently, the transmission of SARS in the Amoy Gardens building, where aerosolised faecal material spread from floor to floor through plumbing and open bathroom grates, but also from open windows to adjacent buildings, demonstrated that air currents can carry virus particles from one building to another [<xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, in over half of the outbreaks we reviewed, there were reports of infections from a single index patient that were between a quarter to one mile apart in the absence of other smallpox cases in the community. At such distances, other modes of transmission are largely infeasible, although secondary aerosolization from contaminated clothing or bedlinen carried from the patient room to the community is possible. Another possibility in the apparently long-range transmissions is that these were exposed to missed mild or vaccine-modified cases. However, it should be noted in the case in Greece, that the secondary case occurred within the incubation period of the index case being symptomatic [<xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The theory of aerial convection is biologically plausible. Several studies in humans and animals have shown that virus concentration is higher in the lower respiratory tract than the upper respiratory tract and that the infectious dose is very low, consistent with smaller airborne infectious particles from the lower respiratory tract being the source of infection transmission from smallpox patients [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In fact, asymptomatic contacts have been documented to have variola in the oropharynx, but are not infectious and only a minority go on to develop smallpox [<xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This suggests that transmission of infection occurs preferentially with a lower respiratory infection, which would generate fine airborne infectious particles [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>It should be noted that the theory of aerial convection was first proposed in England in 1881 following the observations around Fulham and that the data collected since then was in an era of rapidly declining incidence of disease, well after compulsory smallpox vaccination in the country in the mid-1800s. It is likely that prior to routine vaccination, transmission in the community was too widespread and intense to observe unusual patterns of aerial transmission from a single case to others. If there were many cases in a community, any incident cases would be attributed to close proximity transmission. It was only in the period of decline in the incidence of smallpox that the phenomenon became apparent because explanatory source cases in the community were largely absent. During the 100 years leading up to eradication, the low incidence of smallpox made it easier to observe unusual transmissions from single cases, and exclude close contact with a known case. There was, therefore, a limited window to collect data before smallpox became exceedingly rare in England [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Whilst the theory was debated and disputed, including the role of climatic wind conditions in the dispersion of smallpox by air, by 1904 more experts were in favour of aerial convection than against. However, by this time smallpox became too rare to collect ongoing outbreak data, and we are left only with the data from documented outbreaks between 1881 and 1971 [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Other than the systematic analysis of data attempted in England in the late 19th century, we are left with evidence from the individual outbreaks reviewed in this study.</p><p>In 1886, Sir George Buchannan addressed the Epidemiologic Society of England on the topic of aerial convection of smallpox: &#x0201c;We cannot get away from these facts; they are as definite as any known to epidemiology. They had already been ascertained by a multiplicity of careful and detailed observations, in many hospitals, in different epidemics, in London and the Provinces. Recent epidemics have now enabled the question to be tested afresh. That smallpox hospitals have had a deleterious influence in disseminating the disease in surrounding areas is now admitted, so there is no need for this aspect of the case to be argued further, but it is noteworthy that with no other disease has a similar influence been established. In this respect, smallpox stands alone, which proves that its infectivity is exceptional&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The uniqueness of smallpox transmission in contrast to other infections is the striking point made. There are alternative explanations to cases occurring within the incubation period of theoretical exposure to a distantly located primary case. In the Purfleet examples, some experts felt that staff were visiting the communities onshore in secret, possibly carrying with them contaminated clothing or bedding. It was also postulated in Fulham and the rest of the English hospitals that the rings of infection around the buildings were due to movement of staff wearing contaminated clothing. Secondary aerosolization of virus from scabs or other bodily secretions on clothing is possible. The hospital staff, if immune, could conceivably carry fragments of scabs on their clothing which could infect susceptible community contacts whilst the staff themselves remained well. It was documented that smallpox particles are extraordinarily resistant to inactivation by drying (low humidity conditions) and if not exposed to direct sunlight, can remain within dust particles for long periods of time (54,55). If this is the case, isolated single cases could occur by re-aerosolisation of scab material on clothing or bedding. One study in 1957 showed that scabs from smallpox patients could contain the viable virus for 18 months, and for years if the scabs were kept in bottles [<xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In a later study in 1967, Wolff and Croon showed that in dried crusts from skin lesions of variola minor, the virus can remain viable for at least 13 years at room temperature [<xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00033" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-12-00033"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the evidence from these outbreaks is supportive of aerial convection of smallpox at distances of more than a mile in some cases and is biologically plausible due to higher concentration of virus in the lower respiratory tract, environmental factors such as wind, and the low infectious dose. In addition, in many of the observed long-range transmissions, there was a temporal association between potential exposure to a known case and illness. It is possible, that some cases of smallpox were &#x0201c;super-spreaders&#x0201d; with much higher viral shedding than others. This has been seen with other viral respiratory pathogens such as SARS. If this is the case, super-spreaders could explain long-range transmission.</p><p>The theory of aerial convection arose in the period of decline in smallpox incidence in the UK, as the rarity of the disease made it possible to notice unusual transmissions in the absence of close contact. This small window of opportunity for studying aerial convection then rapidly closed, as smallpox became extremely rare in the UK by the early 20th century. This may, in part, explain the loss of this disease transmission theory from current infection control policy and practice, but potentially places smallpox in a different category from other known respiratory transmissible infections. In modern hospitals in high-income countries, negative pressure isolation rooms would reduce any risk of aerial convection. Other explanations for apparent aerial convection are possible, including missed chains of transmission, fomite transmission and secondary aerosolization of contaminated materials such as bed linen. Should smallpox re-emerge, awareness of the possibility of aerial convection is important, as it could inform planning for smallpox treatment facilities and protecting hospitals and surrounding communities.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>C.R.M.: Conceived and designed the study, reviewed abstracts, assisted with screening and selection of relevant studies, reviewed and interpreted each selected study, designed the data analysis, wrote and revised the manuscript.

As supportive evidence, the density of smallpox cases around Fulham hospital fell away proportionally to distance. In 1881, smallpox hospitals were located in densely populated urban areas. That year, WH Power, the medical inspector, showed through a series of disease maps that there was an increasing incidence of smallpox in the city with increasing proximity to the hospital. This effect was observed for at least 1 mile. He investigated the movement of hospital staff and patients and concluded that contact with patients or hospital personnel could not explain the observation. Further, the disease map patterns were not concentrated near main traffic units to and from the hospital highlighting a possible difference in the mechanism of transmission. Power was the first person to attempt to quantify this and coined the term &#x0201c;aerial convection&#x0201d;.
