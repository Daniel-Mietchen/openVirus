<p>Despite these high levels of safety and efficacy with DAA therapy, on‐treatment laboratory monitoring to assess response to therapy and detect toxicity is frequently performed in routine clinical practice. On‐treatment laboratory testing increases the need for human resources (i.e., clinical, phlebotomy, and laboratory staff) and costs of health care. It was recently estimated that the cost of recommended on‐treatment lab monitoring is approximately equivalent to the cost of 1 month of DAA therapy at local prices in LMICs.
