<p>Specifically, in SHARED‐2, the SVR12 rate was 87% compared with an 87% rate in the SHARED‐1 participants. Similarly, the rate of grade 3 and grade 4 AEs was similar in SHARED‐2 and SHARED‐1 participants (12% and 13%, respectively), with no participants in either study group discontinuing therapy due to AEs. None of the grade 3 AEs in SHARED‐2 participants were judged to be related to study medication, and most represented exacerbations of chronic medical conditions in individuals with limited prior access to medical care. Five of 60 participants had laboratory results that met study‐defined criteria for unblinding. However, the availability of these laboratory results did not appear to improve outcomes in these participants. In three of the cases, the results were likely lab errors and led to unnecessary evaluations and clinic visits.</p>
