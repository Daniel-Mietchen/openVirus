<p>The generalizability of this study to support large test‐and‐treat public health programs may be limited as a result of entry criteria excluding patients with decompensated liver disease, renal insufficiency, pregnant women, and HBV co‐infection. Special monitoring considerations as outlined in major guidelines for these groups may prove beneficial, and a simplified approach may not be sufficient. Our treatment group also did not include active injection drug users, who may require additional adherence support and may benefit from additional services and more frequent clinical visits. Furthermore, we did not attempt to quantify the impact or severity of individual AEs on disability or quality of life, and therefore cannot provide direct comparison of cost‐effectiveness of different monitoring algorithms.</p>
