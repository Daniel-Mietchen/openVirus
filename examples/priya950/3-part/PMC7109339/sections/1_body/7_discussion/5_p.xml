<p>A well‐accepted, simplified laboratory‐monitoring algorithm for DAA‐based HCV treatment could substantially lower the overall cost of HCV management and improve overall efficiencies for resource‐constrained health systems.
 <xref rid="hep41482-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> These cost savings would further enhance the return on investment for HCV treatment, which has already been shown to be cost‐effective, and even cost‐saving when using generic DAAs.
 <xref rid="hep41482-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> In LMICs where many direct costs of medications and laboratory exams are borne directly by the patient, such savings are significant and may improve affordability, access, adherence, and patient willingness to test and/or treat. Our study provides valuable evidence for a streamlined, safe, and effective protocol for HCV treatment tailored for LMICs.
