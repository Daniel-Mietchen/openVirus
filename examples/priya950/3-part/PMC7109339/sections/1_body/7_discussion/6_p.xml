<p>Although more challenging to quantify, simplification of monitoring algorithms would also decrease requirements on laboratory infrastructure and health system staffing. Such efficiencies would facilitate decentralization of HCV management to lower‐level facilities (i.e., primary hospitals or health centers) and away from urban tertiary centers, which is a key step to promote access and coverage for HCV services and improving the HCV care cascade.
