<p>The high overall safety and efficacy profile of DAAs has dramatically improved HCV treatment outcomes and offers the potential for the public health implementation of HCV therapy globally, including in resource‐poor settings with widespread epidemics. The pace and progress of this global scale‐up, however, may be limited by the remaining complexities of treatment delivery in poorly equipped health systems with limited experience with DAA management. This study prospectively evaluates the safety and efficacy of DAAs with a simplified laboratory‐monitoring schedule in SSA. We found similar safety, efficacy, and tolerability results with LDV/SOF with the simplified laboratory monitoring compared to the results in those participants treated and monitored with a more intensive monitoring regimen.</p>
