<p>The target sample size of 60 for SHARED‐2 was based on feasibility. We calculated the proportion of SHARED‐2 participants meeting primary efficacy, tolerability, and safety endpoints and requiring laboratory result unblinding and the 95% confidence around these estimates using the Wald approximation. We performed univariate analysis to determine the association between GT‐4 subtype and lack of SVR12. We compared the proportions of SHARED‐2 participants meeting efficacy, tolerability, and safety endpoints to those proportions in SHARED‐1 participants. We conducted all statistical analyses in STATA 15.1 (College Station, TX). The study is registered at
