<p>The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of participants achieving SVR12 (i.e., those with no quantifiable HCV RNA in plasma 12 weeks after the end of study treatment). The primary safety outcome was the proportion of participants with a grade 3 or 4 clinical AE. The primary tolerability outcome was the proportion of participants discontinuing study medication due to an AE. We determined the proportion of participants experiencing a serious AE (i.e., death or an event leading to hospitalization or long‐term disability) and those experiencing a clinical AE of any grade. We also determined the percentage of participants who required unblinding of laboratory results by the independent laboratory monitor due to a laboratory AE or inadequate HCV viral load decline, and the percentage of participants who the study clinician requested unblinding of laboratory results and the subsequent course of the clinical event.</p>
