<p>Plasma HCV‐RNA levels were determined by the RealTime HCV Assay (Abbott, Chicago, IL) with a lower limit of detection of 30 IU/mL. For entry purposes, HCV GT was determined by the HCV Genotype II Amplification Reagent Kit (Abbott). To assess for baseline fibrosis, we calculated the AST‐to‐platelet ratio index (APRI) score using screening AST and platelet values, and Fibrosis‐4 using values for AST, age, platelets, and ALT.
