  <p>Experimental approaches to study hostâ€“pathogen interactions at the placenta. The utility of currently described or potential models of viral infections in the placenta is illustrated. Research models are employed for the investigation of basic features of viral infection and pathogenesis and to investigate unusual features of viral pathogenesis, including sexual transmission, transplacental transmission, and congenital malformations in developing fetuses. In addition, these models could be used in the future to evaluate candidate vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of viral disease in individuals and in fetuses during infection of pregnant hosts.</p>
