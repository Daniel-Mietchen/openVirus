<p>In addition to the exchange of nutrients, the placenta is also a designated site for the transfer of various hormones, drugs, and pathogens. As a result, the placenta also takes on a protective role against pathogens that may cross the maternal–fetal barrier. Recent studies have confirmed the vertical transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV), during which maternal infection with the virus results in pregnancy-related complications and congenital abnormalities, including miscarriage and microcephaly [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These findings, in turn, highlight the ability of viruses like ZIKV to develop strategies to invade and target placental cells for infection, in addition to demonstrating the importance of placental immunity in normal fetal growth and development. Unfortunately, the exact mechanisms employed by certain viruses for immune evasion at the placenta have not been identified, and further studies are necessary to clarify viral strategies to circumvent placental defense mechanisms. Moreover, the experimental challenges associated with studying the human placenta using conventional models can be gradually overcome using novel platforms that rely on microfluidic and microfabrication techniques [
