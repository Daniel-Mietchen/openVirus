<p>The human placenta is a disc-like structure attached to the uterine wall (decidua) and connected to the fetus via the umbilical cord. Placentation, the formation of the placenta, begins as trophoblasts of the fetal blastocyst origin interact with the decidua basalis of maternal endometrium origin. The placenta develops diverse villi containing different types of specialized cells, as shown in

The floating villi are mainly responsible for transporting waste, nutrients, and gases between the mother and the fetus, while the anchoring villi support the decidua [
