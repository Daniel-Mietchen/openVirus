<p>While different types of cells emerge throughout the stages of gestation, placental cells have demonstrated immunomodulatory characteristics and expression of markers associated with stem cells, both of which have made the placenta an important source of cells with potential regenerative and reparative properties [

Igura et al. suggests the placenta as a viable source of MSCs and, upon stimulation, these placental MSCs from the fetal chorionic villi possess the ability to differentiate into the following mesenchymal lineages: adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Characterization of placental MSCs using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry has revealed that they possess stem-cell-like gene and protein expression profiles, in addition to their immunomodulatory and migratory properties [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Luan et al. analyzed the immunosuppressive properties of placental MSCs using ELISA, the results of which showed that placental MSCs inhibit the proliferation and interferon (IFN)-Î³ secretion of T cells [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although placental stem cells have exhibited limited plasticity in most studies due to the experimental challenges associated with studying the placenta, the differential potential of these cells highlights the placenta as a promising therapeutic tool with advantages over conventional methods for obtaining stem and progenitor cells, such as using bone marrow harvested from donors.
