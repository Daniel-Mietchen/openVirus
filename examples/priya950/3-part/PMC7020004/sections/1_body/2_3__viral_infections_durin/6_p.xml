<p>Clinical observation of birth defects during the recent epidemic has also emphasized ZIKV as an important threat to public health in the Americas. ZIKV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that can undergo vertical transmission to cause serious fetal defects, including microcephaly and abnormal central nervous system development [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Previous reports have confirmed ZIKV RNA in the human fetal brain and amniotic fluid [

 <xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggests that cells in the placenta are major targets of ZIKV. In particular, Bayer et al. demonstrated that primary human placental trophoblast cell lines are permissive to ZIKV infection, whereas Schwartz, Rosenberg, and Quicke et al. confirmed the presence of ZIKV infection in HCs, in addition to hyperplasia of HCs and the lack of an inflammatory response in the placenta in response to the infection [

 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Agaard et al. suggested that the receptors necessary to mediate ZIKV entry are expressed during the differentiation process of placental trophoblasts to CTBs and STBs, and allow ZIKV replication to occur in the trophoblasts [

These observations highlight the potential role of the placenta as a reservoir and entry for the virus to reach the fetus and target the trophoblast and HC populations. Because microcephaly is most likely caused by an abnormal development of fetal neural stem cells (NSCs), McGrath et al. also investigated the effects of ZIKV infection on the neuronal differentiation of human NSCs (hNSCs) [

 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that certain strains of ZIKV induce alterations in gene expression of hNSCs, such as upregulation of genes functional in the innate immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis, and downregulation of pathways involved in the cell cycle and neural development. Also a member of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, Dengue virus (DENV) can also infect the fetus through vertical transmission and result in complications for both the mother and fetus, including maternal death, miscarriage, and stillbirth [
