<p>Current laboratory methods for determining viral infections during pregnancy rely on serology, which measures levels of IgM and IgG, and virus detection, including virus isolation, and molecular assays for the detection of viral nucleic acid [

The ability of the previously mentioned pathogens to cross the placental barrier and ultimately infect the developing fetus highlights the need to identify the mechanism underlying maternal–fetal transmission. Findings from previous studies emphasize the important role of fetal placental cells as possible reservoirs and conduit for pathogens at the maternal–fetal interface. Unfortunately, the exact mechanisms underlying viral infections in the placenta remain to be identified. Further studies on vertical transmission of pathogens, and investigation of the interactions between the viruses and the host at the placenta, in particular, are crucial for the discovery and development of vaccines and therapies to prevent and treat congenital infections.
