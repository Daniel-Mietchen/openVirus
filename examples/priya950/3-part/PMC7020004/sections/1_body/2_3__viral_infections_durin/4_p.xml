<p>Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) also belongs to the herpes virus family that includes HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Congenital infection with CMV is of great public health significance due to the wide range of birth defects the virus can cause, including FGR and neurological complications like microcephaly. Interestingly, the clinical spectrum of congenital CMV infections has been found to be variable, with presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to potentially life-threatening disseminated disease. Despite its clinical significance, congenital CMV infection is often not diagnosed properly because the majority of infected infants are asymptomatic at birth and screening programs have not been substantially implemented [
