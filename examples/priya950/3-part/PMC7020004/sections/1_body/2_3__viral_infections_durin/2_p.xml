<p>Rubella virus (RV), belonging to the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, can cause congenital abnormalities which have increasing severity when the maternal infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy. While RV infections normally result in mild symptoms in both children and adults, congenital infections manifest as various birth defects, including microcephaly, that are collectively known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which damages the fetal heart and blood vessels [

Although the transmission route taken by RV to the placenta has yet to be studied, viral antigens have been detected in the chorionic villi, within CTBs and endothelial cells, and viral replication in the fetal endothelial cells results in a different transcriptional profile in comparison to adult cells that were infected with RV in vitro [

The change in gene expression profiles of the infected fetal cells may be explained by the downregulation of genes involved in cytokine production and regulation, in addition to fetal development of sensory organs. RV-induced apoptosis has also been suggested as a contributing factor to CRS, as evident from the cellular damage in sites, such as the eyes, heart, brain, and ears [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Despite the detrimental pathologies associated with RV infection in the fetus, further studies are necessary to understand RV-mediated invasion of the fetal compartments.
