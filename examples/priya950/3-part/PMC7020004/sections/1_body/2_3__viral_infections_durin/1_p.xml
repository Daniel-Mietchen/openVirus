<p>The placenta is considered a site of immune privilege, in the sense that immune responses to pathogens are downregulated to a certain degree to ensure proper function of the placenta [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, the immune response and tolerance must be balanced at the maternal–fetal interface to allow the exchange of nutrients and waste while inhibiting harmful pathogens from crossing the placenta. However, the immunotolerant environment created during pregnancy may permit viral transmission, with the placenta serving as a portal for viral entry. Maternal infections can induce an inflammatory process that poses a major threat to the developing fetus and results in pregnancy complications ranging from miscarriage to preterm birth, malformation, and intrauterine fetal demise [

 <xref rid="viruses-12-00005-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows some of the viruses that can cause vertical and perinatal infections. Some of the most common pathogens that cross the placenta to infect the fetus are collectively referred to as “TORCH,” which stands for 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, others (including varicella zoster virus), rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Based upon its effect on the fetus and development of the congenital Zika syndrome, Zika virus has emerged as the newest TORCH agent [
