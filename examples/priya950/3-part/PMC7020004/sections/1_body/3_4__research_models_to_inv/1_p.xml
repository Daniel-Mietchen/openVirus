<p>The study of early human placental development is hampered by practical and ethical issues, and both animal and in vitro cell culture models are routinely used to study the essential functions of the placenta. In particular, choriocarcinoma-derived cell lines such as BeWo, Jar, and Jeg-3, can be alternatives for and complementary to the primary cell models as in vitro models for placental research. Given the significant spatiotemporal differences in early placental development in rodents and humans, it is important to develop new experimental approaches to study host–pathogen interactions at the maternal–fetal interface during pregnancy. It is also critical for us to elucidate the pathways and defense mechanisms associated with viral infection during pregnancy and further develop effective and safe vaccines. In the following sections, we have summarized current experimental models that can be used to study placental pathogenesis and discuss emerging opportunities to enhance our understanding of the crosstalk between the maternal and fetal compartments (
