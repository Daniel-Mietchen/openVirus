<p>Due to the unique characteristics of human placentation, an ideal model to study human pregnancy remains to be established. However, animal models have proven to be valuable research tools in understanding placental development and function, and range from non-human primates, guinea pigs, and mice to horses and sheep [

Small animal models, including mice, rodents, and guinea pigs, have a short gestational period and give birth to poorly developed young, whereas larger animals, such as non-human primates, which have longer gestational period, comparable to that of humans, and give birth to young with relative maturity [
