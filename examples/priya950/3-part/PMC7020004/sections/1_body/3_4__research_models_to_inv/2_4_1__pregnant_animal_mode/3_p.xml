<p>Guinea pigs are often selected as an animal model to study fetal growth restriction and transfer of substrates across the placenta. Jansson and Persson et al. demonstrated using guinea pigs that growth restriction is linked to an impaired placental transfer, resulting in a reduction of the amino acids available [
