<p>The similarities of trophoblast cell types between horses and humans have made horses another animal model used in the study of pregnancy immunology. Although the equine placenta is classified as diffuse, with maternalâ€“fetal exchange occurring across all available surface, the trophoblast populations of human and horse placentas share significant phenotypic similarities. Non-human primates could be considered the best animal model to study placental conditions due to their important similarities to humans. However, their use in biomedical research is greatly limited due to important ethical questions, as well as their high cost. Apes resemble humans in having interstitial implantation, while chimpanzee and gorilla resemble humans in the routes and extent of trophoblast invasion during placentation.</p>
