<p>The maternalâ€“fetal interface has been studied using cultures of human placental explants, a method that requires optimization to mimic the in utero environments of gestational periods through differential pressure, culture medium, and extracellular matrices. Viral pathogenesis has also been modeled in placental and decidual tissue explants, demonstrating which placental cell types are susceptible to infections and providing insight into specific transmission routes in the placenta [

First-trimester human placental explant culture by Genbacev et al. was used to show that cytotrophoblasts are vulnerable to infection with ZIKV strain MR766, whereas cytotrophoblasts cultured from full-term placental explants in Bayer et al. were not infected by MR766 due to the high level of type III interferon secretion [

In Platt et al., neurotropic flaviviruses related to ZIKV, including West Nile virus, were shown to be able not only to cause placental infection, but also to replicate efficiently in second trimester placental explants of the decidua and chorionic villi and fetal membrane [
