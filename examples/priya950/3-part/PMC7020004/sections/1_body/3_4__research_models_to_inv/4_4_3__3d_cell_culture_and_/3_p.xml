<p>Although these research models have various limitations in terms of modeling specific interactions at the placenta, these platforms still allow physiological conditions of the host to be recreated for interface of hostâ€“pathogen interactions. Exploring how these recently developed technologies may be leveraged to address the major technical challenges in studying the placenta will lead to greater understanding of this highly specialized organ.</p>
