<p>To address the limitations of conventional two dimensional cell culture techniques, researchers in stem cell and developmental biology have been making efforts with engineers and physical scientists to develop advanced in vitro technologies for three dimensional (3D) cell culture models. Reconstructions of host microenvironments using 3D tissue culture, multicellular complexity, microbiota composition, and biomechanical forces allow researchers to mimic essential features present in the native host microenvironment. This recent shift to studies utilizing 3D cell culture models has given rise to the following three models: 3D cell cultures engineered in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, extracellular-matrix-embedded/organoid models, and organ-on-a-chip models [
