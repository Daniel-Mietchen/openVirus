<p>Perhaps we can learn from remarkable progress in ZIKV research, which has provided significant insight into the role of immune cells, cytokines, and viral virulence during pregnancy in the past few years. For examples, Foo et al. identified CD14
 <sup>+</sup> monocytes as the primary target for both African- and Asian-lineage ZIKV infection from pregnant women [
 <xref rid="B123-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Interestingly, there was differential immunomodulatory response in the monocytes of these pregnant women, in that African-lineage ZIKV infection led to M1-skewed inflammation, whereas Asian-lineage ZIKV infection led to M2-skewed immunosuppression.
