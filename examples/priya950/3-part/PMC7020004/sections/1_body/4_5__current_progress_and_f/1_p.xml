<p>Using the research models mentioned above, the influence of different immune signaling pathways following viral infections during pregnancy, particularly those of the placenta and fetal development, could be investigated and answer the following long-standing questions. Why do some maternal infections, but not others, lead to congenital diseases? What are the cellular sources and targets of virus in the placenta and the fetus? What are the molecular mechanisms of virus-induced host damage in target cells?</p>
