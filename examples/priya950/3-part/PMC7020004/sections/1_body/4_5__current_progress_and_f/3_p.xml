<p>Distinct roles of type I vs. type III IFNs were also highlighted in ZIKV research. Although the deficiency of IFN-αR in mice can lead to higher ZIKV titers in the placentas of offspring ZIKV titers, while exposure of midgestation human chorionic villous explants to type I, but not type III IFNs alters placental morphology, resulting in abnormal architecture of the maternal–fetal barrier [

 <xref rid="B125-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. On the other hand, type III IFNs have been suggested to play an important role in host defense. Human trophoblasts constitutively release type III IFNs, which function in both a paracrine and autocrine manner to protect trophoblast and non-trophoblast cells from ZIKV infection [

 <xref rid="B126-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. A recent report by Caine et al. indicates the defensive role of type III IFNs in the female reproductive tract [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. In particular, mice lacking IFN-λ signaling sustain greater female reproductive tract infection when progesterone is administered. Exogenous IFN-λ treatment confers an antiviral effect when mice receive both estradiol and progesterone, but not progesterone alone. Further studies will be necessary to delineate the pathways by which ZIKV accesses the fetal compartment, evades restriction by trophoblast-derived IFNλ1 and other trophoblast-specific antiviral factors, and/or uses alternative strategies to cross the placental barrier.
