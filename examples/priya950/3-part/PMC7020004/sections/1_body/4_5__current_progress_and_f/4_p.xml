<p>Current progress in understanding the molecular defense mechanisms of placental cells has been focused on components secreted by trophoblasts: miRNAs and exosomes. Analysis of the miRNA expression profiles in the placenta has revealed that a cluster of placenta-specific miRNAs linked to chromosome 19, in particular, are differentially expressed by villous trophoblasts during placental development [

 <xref rid="B128-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Among many miRNAs expressed by human trophoblasts, the chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC) constitutes the largest human miRNA cluster, and C19MC miRNAs are expressed from chromosome 19q13.41 [

 <xref rid="B131-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Study of this miRNA secretion using the BeWo cell line revealed that STBs were the main source of the miRNAs released into the maternal circulation, and the differential expression of C19MC miRNAs regulates placental physiology [
