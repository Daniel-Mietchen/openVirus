<p>Going forward, investigation of how the microbiome is associated with placental pathology is a new area of interest. Increasing evidence indicates a link between preterm birth and the microbiomes of tissues previously thought to be sterile, including the placenta. Among the first evidence of a placental microbiome is the finding by Aaggard et al. that bacteria are found in the placenta in full-term pregnancies in the absence of histological inflammation and clinical infection [

 <xref rid="B138-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>,
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>,
 <xref rid="B140-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. As expected, pregnancies that resulted in spontaneous preterm births were associated with placental microbiota that varied depending on the severity of chorioamnionitis, in addition to significant alterations in certain bacterial metabolic pathways, which may be contributing factors to an increased risk of preterm birth. Ferretti et al. have also suggested vertical transmission of microbes from multiple maternal sites of the body, among which the mouth and gut make the greatest contributions to microbial diversity [
 <xref rid="B141-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. In contrast, a recent study reported that bacterial infections of the placenta are uncommon and do not account for the majority of cases of pregnancy-related complications, including preterm birth [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-12-00005" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. According to de Goffau et al., bacterial acquisition by infants occurs during labor and delivery, and a healthy human placenta does not contain a microbiome. However, one cannot rule out vertical transmission of microbes and, given the possibility that placental membrane microbiome altered by viral infection may also contribute to the risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and microcephaly, metagenomic sequencing studies will be very important to identify bacterial species unique to the placenta and alteration patterns in the microbiome composition.
