<p>Once thought to provide a passive structural and physiological barrier at the maternalâ€“fetal interface, the placenta is now emerging as an important regulator of immune response during pregnancy. Future modeling of viral infections in the placenta using novel platforms such as 3D cell cultures or organ-on-a-chip devices will address the extent of pathophysiology associated with viral infections and the underlying biological mechanisms that can lead to the development of therapeutics to prevent pregnancy complications.</p>
