<p>The epidemics of ZIKV and its clinical consequences during pregnancy raised awareness of the importance of research into placental pathology and immunology. Although many risk factors have been taken into consideration in identifying the etiological agents of miscarriage, infertility and birth defects, many cases of pregnancy complications are yet to be accompanied by a clear explanation. As we previously summarized, certain viral infections can lead to detrimental defects on the developing fetus. Several studies have confirmed the role of viral infections as a direct cause of miscarriage and intrauterine fetal demise, especially during the second trimester of pregnancy. However, the association between infection during the first trimester and miscarriages is still questionable. Therefore, it will be important to further characterize cellular and molecular virulence mechanisms of viral pathogenesis using cells or tissues derived from the placenta harvested from first trimester pregnancies.</p>
