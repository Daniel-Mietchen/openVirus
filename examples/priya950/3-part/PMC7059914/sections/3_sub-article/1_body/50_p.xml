<p>General: Identifying the hotspots is first natural step as currently presented in the paper. However the current detailed description of explained versus unexplained heterogeneity explained for the larger covariate groupings in the main results text is not in a policy maker friendly format and needs to be revised to maximise the readability/usability of these results. It would be more useful to present key findings highlighting which risk factors or covariates are the most attributable both within and across countries to assist with geographic/locally tailored intervention packages.</p>
