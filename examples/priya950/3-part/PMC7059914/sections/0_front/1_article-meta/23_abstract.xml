    <p>Previous studies showed that heterogeneity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence exists among the general population in Eastern and Southern Africa, the geographic area most severely affected by the HIV pandemic.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Whereas HIV prevalence among adults does not reveal when persons have been infected, young adults are most likely recently infected, and therefore high-prevalence areas among this subpopulation can proxy locations of ongoing transmission.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>The location and underlying determinants of high HIV prevalence areas among young adults can help to shape spatially targeted and risk-groupâ€“tailored interventions to reduce transmission.</p>

  <title>What did the researchers do and find?</title>
  <list list-type="bullet">
   <list-item>
    <p>We found clear areas of high prevalence in young adults in between vast regions with relatively low prevalence for all 7 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>HIV prevalence in young adults was partly explained by an interplay of behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental (i.e., economic activity) factors, and environmental factors were especially predictive of high transmission locations.</p>

   <list-item>
    <p>Our findings, together with the existing evidence, indicate that key population dynamics, especially related to seasonal and economic migration and associated sex work, might play a major role in fuelling HIV transmission.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>In further reducing HIV transmission in Eastern and Southern Africa, areas of high HIV prevalence in young adults should be priority areas for tailored HIV prevention interventions towards reaching the fast-track commitments to end the HIV epidemic by 2030.</p>
