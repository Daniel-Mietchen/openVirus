<p>Second, we developed a series of multiple multilevel logistic regression models to determine to what extent behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental determinants of HIV can explain individual- and location-level HIV prevalence among young adults. Missing values (up to 2.6%) were checked to be missing at random and, if so, imputed using multiple imputation. First, bivariate associations were tested, and all variables with a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value larger than 0.1 were excluded. We then developed multiple models using a stepwise approach. In the first step, we made an ‘empty’ model—with HIV prevalence as the dependent variable, with only age- and sex-fixed effects, and with location random effects as predictors. In the second step, we used stepwise forward selection to construct 3 separate multiple regression models for behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors, respectively, out of the nested model. Likelihood tests were used to determine whether the addition of a variable improved the statistical fit of the regression models significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the third step, we used the same stepwise forward selection to construct a full model containing both behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. We did not adjust for country-level confounding in the main analysis because we expect the associations between HIV and the predictor variables to be similar across countries. However, we did perform a sensitivity analysis in which we added country-fixed effects to the final model. We compared the marginal and conditional 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> of the models at each step. The marginal 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> indicates how much of the HIV heterogeneity is explained by the fixed factors in the model. The conditional 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> represents the amount of heterogeneity explained by both fixed and random factors in the model. By comparing both 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> values, we assessed how much of HIV heterogeneity is explained by the fixed factors in the models and how much is additionally captured by the location-level random effect in each model [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We translated variance of random effects into Median Odds Ratios (MORs) as an indicator of geographical heterogeneity. For each model, the MOR would be equal to 1.0 if there were no differences in probability of being HIV infected per sample location, and it can be interpreted as the increase in (median) HIV risk that is associated with moving from a location with a low random effect to a location with a high random effect. See elsewhere for a more detailed explanation [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The MOR equation is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s002">S1 Equations</xref>. The final model is also fitted as modified Poisson (with robust variance) for easier interpretation of the estimates, here as relative risks (RRs) instead of odds ratios (ORs).
