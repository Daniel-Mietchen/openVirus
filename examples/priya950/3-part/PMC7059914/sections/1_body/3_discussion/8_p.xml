<p>In conclusion, we our findings show that consistent clustering of HIV prevalence exists among young adults in seven high burden countries in Eastern and Southern Africa, with clearly identifiable high-prevalence areas. This heterogeneity is driven by an interplay of behavioural, socioeconomic and environmental factors, and the locations of high-prevalence areas suggest that key population dynamics, especially related to seasonal and economic migration and associated sex work, play a major role. In further reducing HIV transmission in Eastern and Southern Africa, areas of high HIV prevalence in young adults could be priority areas for tailored HIV prevention interventions in line with SDG3 and UNAIDS targets to end the HIV pandemic by 2030.</p>
