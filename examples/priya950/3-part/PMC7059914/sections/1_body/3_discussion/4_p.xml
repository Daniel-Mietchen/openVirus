<p>Individual HIV prevalence in young adults was strongly associated with the reported number of lifetime sex partners and reported prevalence of STIs or STI symptoms, providing further evidence that geospatial clustering of HIV is linked to the clustering of risk behaviour, across all countries [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We found that the reported condom use at last sex act was associated with an increased risk of being infected with HIV. This is a well-known counterintuitive finding, and reflects the fact that condom use tends to be higher (yet sometimes insufficient) among people with riskier sexual behaviour, or reflects bias due to the fact that people who are aware of their positive HIV status are more likely to use a condom, to protect their partner [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This finding highlights the need to stimulate condom use, but more importantly increase access to effective HIV prevention interventions more broadly. Our finding that having education beyond the primary level seems to be strongly protective against HIV, is consistent with observations in the literature [
