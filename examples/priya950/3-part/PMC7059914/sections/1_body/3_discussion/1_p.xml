<p>Our findings showed that substantial levels of spatial heterogeneity in HIV prevalence exist among adults and young adults throughout all 7 Eastern and Southern African countries analysed in this study. Especially in young adults, micro-epidemics of relatively high prevalence alternated with areas of very low prevalence, clearly illustrating the existence of areas with high levels of transmission. Overall, 15.6% (marginal

Maps of interpolated random effect estimates at each sample location showed that environmental predictors were better at specifically predicting HIV prevalence at the high-prevalence areas than sexual behavioural or socioeconomic variables, yet substantial heterogeneity at other high-prevalence areas remains unexplained.
