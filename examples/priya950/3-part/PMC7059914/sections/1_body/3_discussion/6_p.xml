<p>To our knowledge, we are the first to utilise geolocated HIV prevalence data from young adults specifically, to explore geospatial heterogeneity in the HIV epidemics of Eastern and Southern Africa, and identify potential areas with high levels of transmission. Previously, Cuadros 
 <italic>et al</italic> proposed a co-kriging approach to estimate subnational HIV prevalence estimates, incorporating HIV prevalence and environmental determinants [

In addition, Palk and Blower recently showed that places of high HIV prevalence in adults (aged 15â€“49 years) in Malawi are associated with reported higher rates of high-risk sex, defined as the number of lifetime partners [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our results show that heterogeneity in HIV is associated with a range of sexual behavioural, socioeconomic and environmental variables, and that these are highly affected by age. Therefore, a standardised approach to map heterogeneity of an HIV epidemic should take age stratifications into account, and future studies on geospatial heterogeneity and its drivers should include behavioural, socioeconomic and environmental determinants.
