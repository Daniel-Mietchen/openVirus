 <sup>2</sup>: e.g., percentage of heterogeneity explained by both fixed and random effects in the model) of the HIV heterogeneity could be explained by age and sex alone (‘nested’ model). The remaining variance captured by the model (19.1%) is attributed to location-level random effects. Environmental fixed effects explain most of the heterogeneity in HIV prevalence among young adults (marginal

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> 15.6%, conditional

 <sup>2</sup> 29.6%) by an interplay of sexual behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental variables. The MOR of the nested model is 2.41, whereas the MOR of the final model is 1.94. This illustrates that, although some of the location-level heterogeneity is captured by the model fixed-effect covariates, almost two-thirds of the heterogeneity in HIV prevalence at sample locations still could not be explained by the covariates in the model. Overall, environmental fixed effects reduce the location-level heterogeneity more than sexual behavioural and socioeconomic fixed effects (MORs of 1.95, 2.35, and 2.30, respectively). Adjusting for country improves the model fit but does not change the importance of the different predictors and does not considerably increase the degree of explained heterogeneity (marginal
