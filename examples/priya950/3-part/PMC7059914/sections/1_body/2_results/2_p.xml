 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003042.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the geospatial distribution of HIV prevalence in adults (panel A) and young adults (panel B) in 7 countries of Eastern and Southern Africa. All countries showed substantial levels of heterogeneity in HIV prevalence at the subnational level. Overall, HIV prevalence is higher among adults—with high-prevalence areas in the same locations—but prevalence among adults is larger and more spread out compared to among young adults (illustrated by the large red and purple areas). Geospatial heterogeneity in HIV prevalence among young adults was more profound than among adults in most of the countries in our analysis, illustrated by clear concentrated micro-epidemics (red and purple areas) located in between areas of very low prevalence (white, yellow, and orange areas). In both Zambia and Zimbabwe, high-prevalence areas, of over 15% HIV prevalence in young adults, were found. The national HIV prevalence among young adults in Malawi is about 3.6%, yet our analysis identified areas where HIV prevalence reached levels of up to 11%, in particular around the highways and major cities in the south. Similarly, in Kenya HIV prevalence in young adults is about 3.9% nationally, yet prevalence around Lake Victoria reaches levels of over 15%. Maps and scatterplots illustrating the more detailed differences in HIV prevalence (per 5 km
