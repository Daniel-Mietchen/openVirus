   <bold>Continuous surface maps of HIV prevalence in adults (women 15–49 years and men 15–54 years) (A) and young adults (women 15–24 years and men 15–29 years) (B) for 7 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa.</bold> Predicted geographical distribution of HIV prevalence resulted from interpolating data on HIV prevalence in geolocated sample locations derived from the most recent DHS or AIS in each country, using ordinary kriging. Major cities (more than 250,000 inhabitants) are indicated on the maps. To enhance comparison between both panels, we applied the same legend for HIV prevalence levels. The HIV prevalence maps for women and men separately are provided in
