   <bold>Maps present the interpolated random effect estimates of the nested ‘empty’ logistic regression model (A), best-fitting logistic regression model (B), and the separate models including only sexual behavioural (C), socioeconomic (D), and environmental variables (E) among young adults (women 15–24 years and men 15–29 years) for 7 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa.</bold> For the nested ‘empty’ model (A), random effect estimates reflect HIV prevalence levels among young adults (see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003042.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For the other models (B–E), random effect estimates are lower at (some of the) areas with high HIV prevalence levels, indicating that the additional variables in each model to some extent explain HIV heterogeneity at these locations. Circles point out high-prevalence areas of HIV among young adults (1) around Lake Victoria, (2) around Nacala (and Pemba) port, (3) around Beira (and Quelimane) port, (4) around Maputo city and port, (5) around Plumtree border crossing, (6) around Mongu city, (7) in the Copperbelt mining area, and (8) in Nchelenge district. HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.
