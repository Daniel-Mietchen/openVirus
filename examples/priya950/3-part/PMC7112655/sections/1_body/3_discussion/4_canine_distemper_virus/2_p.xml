<p id="par0165">CDV was mainly detected in the Canidae family with an overall prevalence below 10 %. Viral RNA was only recorded between 2005 and 2008 with a prevalence peak in the first year among the wolf population (67 %) followed by a drop down, suggesting an epizootic behaviour of the virus. Similar infection pattern has been documented in several animal species worldwide [

 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], with CDV often implicated in disease outbreaks and mortality events. The highly infectious nature of CDV [
