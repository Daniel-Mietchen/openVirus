<p id="par0170">CDV serological data shows a much higher proportion of positive samples (65 %) compared to nucleic acid detection. In addition to canids, we confirmed that mustelids and viverrids have also been exposed to CDV. The observed high seroprevalence suggests a high rate of circulation among the carnivore in northern Portugal and confirms these species as being highly susceptible to CDV infections. Considering CDV epidemiology, our finding may indicate CDV spill-over into wild populations, quite possibly from domestic and stray dogs acting as disease reservoirs [
