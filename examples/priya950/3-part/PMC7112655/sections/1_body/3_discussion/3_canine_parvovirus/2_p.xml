<p id="par0150">Our study identified a high prevalence of CPV among all surveyed species. This seems to be particularly significant in the two species of canids, where wolves presented an infection rate close to 100 %, although with a high variability of viral loads (ranging from 41.9–12.5 Cts). CPV was detected in all sampled years and across all seasons in

In foxes, for example, CPV DNA was detected in almost 79 % of the tissue samples, not far from 83.3 % obtained in our study and within the confidence interval. Contrastingly, other European studies described a much lower prevalence, ranging from 3.5–15.2% in wolf scats in Italy [
