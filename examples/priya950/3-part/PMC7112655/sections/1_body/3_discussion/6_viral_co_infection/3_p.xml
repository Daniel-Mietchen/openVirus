<p id="par0190">Infections by CCoV seem to be aggravated when occur simultaneously with CPV [

 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and/or CDV [
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], which could explain seven of the unknown deaths in wolves where we detected any of the two combinations and even one individual infected by the three viruses. Yet, Mech &amp; Goyal [
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] showed that the negative impact of CPV seems to be attenuated once the virus becomes enzootic in a population, which could explain the apparent lack of outbreaks in our system, even with such a high prevalence of co-infections. However, this suggestion should be interpreted with caution due to the absence of demographic data and survival of pups for the populations here considered.
