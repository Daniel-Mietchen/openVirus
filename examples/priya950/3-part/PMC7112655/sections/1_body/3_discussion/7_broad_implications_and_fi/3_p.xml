<p id="par0210">Considering the availability of recent data regarding CDV and CPV in Portugal [10, 31; this study], it is suggested an active viral circulation among the animal population studied. Unvaccinated dogs, as well as wolf prey species, or scattered infectious faeces/urine, make the transmission of viral pathogens between populations a likely scenario [

 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] present a challenge for pathogen detection and consequently for adequate wild carnivore populationsâ€™ management. This means that the results obtained in this and other studies may underestimate the infectious pressure, particularly when a single diagnostic test is used. Thus, continuous surveillance of viral pathogens and longitudinal studies in stray and wild animal populations are crucial to detect new viral variants potentially escaping both the host immune system and detection methods.
