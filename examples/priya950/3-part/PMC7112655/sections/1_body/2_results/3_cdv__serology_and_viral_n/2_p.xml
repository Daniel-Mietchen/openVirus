<p id="par0110">CDV RNA was detected in two families (
 <italic>Canidae</italic> and 
 <italic>Mustelidae</italic>) with an overall low prevalence (8.1 %) (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The organs with the higher yields were the liver and spleen in 
 <italic>C. lupus</italic>, but the intestinal tract in 
 <italic>V. vulpes</italic> and 
 <italic>G. genetta</italic>. CDV RNA was only recorded in 2005 and 2008 (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The wolf populations reached a frequency of 67 % (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>: 2/3) in 2005, followed by a decrease in 2008 (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>: 20 %; 1/5). We found a higher prevalence during the summer/ autumn months and progressively decreasing towards spring (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). However, the small sample size did not allow for a statistically significant effect of seasonality (Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.083).
