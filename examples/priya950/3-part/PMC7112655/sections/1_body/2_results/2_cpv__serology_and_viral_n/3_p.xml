<p id="par0105">Antibodies against CPV were found in 60.0 % of the samples, including 33 canids where seroprevalence in wolves reached almost 74 % (
 <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> ). Nevertheless, evidence of a positive association was found between CPV seropositivity in wolves and the sample conservation status (Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), where better preserved samples had a higher likelihood of detecting Ab. Among mustelids, the two sampled individuals of
