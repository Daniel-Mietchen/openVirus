<p id="par0100">We detected CPV DNA in all the species with an overall prevalence of 91.9 % (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). Particularly in 
 <italic>C. lupus</italic>, CPV DNA was detected in all sampled years (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ; 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ) with prevalence of infection close to 100 % across the four seasons. Thus, time of the year had no significant effect on the infection status in wolves (Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.000). Samples showed an average Ct of 34.6, ranging from 41.9 to 12.5 Cts (standard deviation 4.4). 
 <italic>C. lupus</italic> liver samples showed a higher frequency of viral DNA positivity, but positive results were also obtained from the spleen and lymph node. 
 <italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic> were also highly positive (83.3 %; 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) with viral DNA detected in the lungs, liver, spleen and small intestine. Both mustelids tested positive for CPV with viral DNA detected in the small intestine in L. 
 <italic>lutra</italic> and lungs in 
 <italic>M. meles</italic> (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among the few screened viverrids, 
 <italic>G. genetta</italic> yielded the lowest prevalence with 1 out of 2 animals positive (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) in the lung. Both marten species generated positives in lungs and small intestine.
