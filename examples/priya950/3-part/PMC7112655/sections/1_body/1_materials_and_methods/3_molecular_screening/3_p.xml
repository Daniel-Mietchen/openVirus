<p id="par0070">We conducted Molecular screening with a TaqMan® quantitative PCR system already described [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. CPV DNA was amplified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in a 20 μl reaction with 25 ng of template, using the TaqMan® Gene Expression 2× Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.3μM of primer forward, 0.3μM of primer reverse and 0.25μM of TaqMan probe. CDV and CCoV RNA were amplified by one step reverse transcription-qPCR (rt-qPCR) using the TaqMan® RNA-to-Ct (TM) 1 step kit, 0.3μM of primer forward, 0.3μM of primer reverse and 0.25μM of TaqMan probe in a 20 μl reaction with 25 ng of template.
