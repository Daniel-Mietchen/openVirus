<p id="par0075">We performed the amplification in the Applied 7300 instrument (Applied Biosystems) and the cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95 째C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 째C for 15 s and 1 min at 60 째C. When the template was RNA the amplification cycle included an initial reverse transcription step at 48 째C for 15 min.</p>
