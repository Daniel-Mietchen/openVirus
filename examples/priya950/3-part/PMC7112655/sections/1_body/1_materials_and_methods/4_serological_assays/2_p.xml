<p id="par0085">We used lung, liver or spleen tissue extracts to detect CDV and CPV Abs by Indirect Enzyme-linked immunoassay commercial kits Ingezim Parvo Canino 1.5.CPV.K.1 and Ingezim Moquillo IgG 1.5.CDG.K.1 (Ingenaza, Spain), according to the manufacturer instructions. Tissue extracts were tenfold diluted for CDV and CPV testing.
