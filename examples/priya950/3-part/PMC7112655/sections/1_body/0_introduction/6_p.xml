<p id="par0045">Several carnivore species have suffered dramatic declines in Europe during the last two centuries, with human activities leading to fragmented populations and consequently genetic isolation [

 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although infectious diseases are not usually the main factor affecting the survival of these species, virulent pathogens can act as a mortality source and cause epidemics. In fact, small fragmented populations, such as those of Iberian wolves, are thought to become more vulnerable to disease outbreaks [

 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Multi-host pathogens, such as CPV, CDV or CCoV, can be maintained in the system through domestic dogs or other reservoir hosts, potentially impairing the viability of smaller more vulnerable wolf populations [
