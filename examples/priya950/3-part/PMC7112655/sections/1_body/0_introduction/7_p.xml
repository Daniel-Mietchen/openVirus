<p id="par0050">Despite all three viruses having already been reported in the Portuguese territory in wild carnivores, either by detection of antibodies (Abs) or nucleic acids (see [

 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], an assessment of the potential threat posed is hampered by the difficulty of overlaying the different methods for analyses. The available diagnose tools used (serology or molecular) or the target material (scats or body tissues) impair, to some extent, the interpretation and comparison between datasets. Thus, with the present study we intend to investigate occurrence of infection and spatio-temporal patterns of selected viral pathogens (CDV, CCoV and CPV) circulating in free-ranging populations of carnivores from northern Portugal. The use of combined approaches that include serological (Abs) and molecular detection as means for an enhanced perception of the results and inter study comparisons is discussed. The resulting information has critical implications for understanding of disease dynamics in these species and broader conservation policies.
