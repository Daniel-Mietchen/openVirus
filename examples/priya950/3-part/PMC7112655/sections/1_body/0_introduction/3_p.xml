<p id="par0030">Viruses are important pathogens of wild carnivores that can affect populations through increased mortality and/or decreased general health [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) are known pathogens of domestic and wild carnivores worldwide [

 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>]. Although CPV infection is a relatively new disease first reported in the late 1970s in domestic dogs [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the virus has spread rapidly [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In Europe, the presence of CPV has been documented in a variety of free-ranging carnivore populations from canids to mustelids and viverrids, through serology or molecular methods [

 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>]. Additionally, Duarte et al. 2013 [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported high exposure to parvoviruses in mesocarnivores from Portugal, but to date, no cases of mortality among wild carnivores have been reported in Iberian Peninsula [
