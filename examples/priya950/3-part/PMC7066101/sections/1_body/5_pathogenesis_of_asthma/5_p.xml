<p id="Par26">A recent study showed that the risk of developing asthma was highest in infants having IgE sensitization and wheeze due to rhinovirus-C infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These results suggest that mechanisms of virus-induced illnesses differ. The mechanisms underlying the observed associations between rhinoviruses, allergic sensitization, and the development of asthma are not fully understood. It is possible that there is a causal relationship where acute rhinovirus infection induces various cellular factors regulating host response, airway inflammation, repair, and remodeling, as well as increase proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Also, rhinovirus infection and allergen exposure increase epithelial cells to produce IL-25 and IL-33, thus promoting Th2 type inflammation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Alternatively, virus infection can simply be an early marker of impaired anti-viral response; diminished type I and III interferon production and/or abnormal host response; induced expression of IgE receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] or genetic susceptibility to rhinovirus infection due to enhanced expression of rhinovirus-C receptor CDHR3 in the airway epithelium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Most likely, all of these mechanisms play a role in the development of either atopic or non-atopic asthma.
