<p id="Par43">Airway epithelial cells form a barrier to the outside world and are the front line of mucosal immunity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Cytokines and inflammatory mediators associated with allergic inflammation induce epithelial barrier disruption. Additional factors that influence the severity of the viral infection and the risk of asthma exacerbation are allergic sensitization and the airway microbiome. For example, RV infection and allergic sensitization synergistically increase the risk of exacerbation [
