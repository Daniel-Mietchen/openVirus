<p id="Par8">RV-C has also been the most common RV species among hospitalized and intensive care unit asthma patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Patients with CDHR3 (cadherin-related family member 3) asthma risk allele and atopic individuals have been more susceptible to RV-C infections (see below) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. At the cellular level, RV-C has caused faster replication rate and induction of more robust cellular responses than RV-B, as demonstrated in cultures of differentiated airway epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Overall, the clinical impact of RV-A is close to RV-C among asthmatic subjects, whereas the impact of RV-B is much weaker. Cohort studies have, however, shown that RV-B infections may slightly increase the risk of exacerbation in children whose asthma is of greater severity [
