<p id="Par7">Rhinovirus is a non-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus in the family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus, and is classified into three species (RV-A, B, and C) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There are over 170 distinct RV genotypes, including 80 RV-A, 32 RV-B, and 65 RV-C genotypes. The RV-C group was not found until 2006 (approximately 50 years after the first discovery of other RVs) since it does not grow in conventional cell cultures. Currently, PCR is the method of choice in identifying RVs from nasal secretions. We are moving towards RV species specific diagnosis since RV-A and RV-C appear to cause the more severe course of illness than RV-B [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. RV does not cause chronic infection or “colonization” in healthy individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. RV circulates year-round with multiple coexisting genotypes that potentiate its asthmagenic activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Peak prevalence in temperate climates occurs in the early autumn and late spring. In exacerbations of asthma, RV-A and RV-C are clearly more common etiologic RV species than RV-B—similar to wheezing illnesses in early childhood [
