<p id="Par5">Respiratory virus infections play a significant role in all wheezing (defined as a bilateral whistling sound during expiration accompanied by dyspnea) illnesses from bronchiolitis to asthma. Virus detection rates using PCR have reached 100% in bronchiolitis, 85–95% in children with recurrent wheezing or asthma exacerbation, and 80% in adults with asthma exacerbation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, only a few studies support their association with a more severe clinical course [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It should be noted that virus detection rates using PCR may be over 35% level in asymptomatic subjects, especially in young children which sometimes question the significance of virus detection [
