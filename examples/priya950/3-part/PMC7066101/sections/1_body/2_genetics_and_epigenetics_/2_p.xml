<p id="Par11">The first asthma locus discovered in GWAS, approximately 10Â years ago, was the chromosome 17q21 locus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is still the strongest known asthma locus, and it is particularly associated with childhood-onset asthma and asthma with severe exacerbations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, the 17q21 asthma locus is strongly associated with increased risk of early wheezing episodes triggered by viruses, including rhinoviruses, and children with early viral wheezing have a much higher risk of later asthma if they carry 17q21 risk variants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Also, 17q21 risk variants seem to interact with several environmental factors so that children with risk variants are more susceptible to having older siblings in terms of increased risk of early wheeze, but also more protected against asthma when exposed to a farming environment or pets in the household in early life [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The biological mechanisms associated with the 17q21 locus are still incompletely understood and might involve several genes in the region, including

 <italic>GSDMB</italic>, 
 <italic>GSDMA</italic>, 
 <italic>PGAP3</italic>, 
 <italic>ERBB2</italic>, and 
 <italic>IKZF3</italic> and several cell types, including immune and airway epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Most follow-up studies have focused on 
 <italic>ORMDL3</italic> as the causal gene with proposed mechanisms related to sphingolipid synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], regulation of eosinophils [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and regulation of the ICAM1 receptor, which might explain the susceptibility for rhinovirus infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Further understanding of the biological pathways related to this locus might provide important novel clues to the mechanisms of viral infections and asthma.
