<p id="Par10">Asthma is a highly heritable disease with heritability estimates from twin studies of more than 50%, and even higher for childhood asthma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Genetics is, therefore, one important tool for understanding the disease mechanisms of asthma. Our knowledge of the genetic background of asthma has increased rapidly during recent years through methodological advances allowing so-called genome-wide association studies (GWAS) where millions of genetic variants covering the entire genome can be tested without a prior hypothesis about underlying mechanisms. Large GWAS have now identified more than 100 genes/loci associated with asthma and related traits, with the strongest signal seen for the childhood-onset disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Of these, the majority of susceptibility genes are related to the immune system.
