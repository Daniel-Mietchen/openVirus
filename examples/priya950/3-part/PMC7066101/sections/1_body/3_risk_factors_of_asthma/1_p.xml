<p id="Par16">Severe acute bronchiolitis or early wheezing is associated with an increased risk of subsequent asthma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This disease may persist until early adulthood, and the strongest association with worse long-term prognosis was observed in children infected with RV-C and RV-A virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These observations come from cohort (population) studies, where the most striking relationship was recorded in children at high risk, i.e., in patients hospitalized due to severe disease, in children from atopic families, and children with atopy (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that RV is most likely a revealing factor for those with early airway inflammation (i.e., broken epithelial barrier, T helper
 <sub>2</sub> cell polarized immune events), genetic variation children (i.e., may markedly increase the risk of asthma), and/or low interferon responses (i.e., impaired viral defense) and therefore serves as a clinically useful risk marker [
