<p id="Par18">We have recently reviewed the main non-viral risk and protective factors of asthma and summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Rapid urbanization, pollution, and climate change, all leading to the loss of biodiversity, promote chronic non-communicable illnesses such as asthma and allergies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Exposure to pollutants such as NO
 <sub>2</sub> and high exposure to allergens in children with allergic asthma increase the severity of virus-induced exacerbations of asthma. Maternal stress and depression have been associated with acute wheezing illnesses. Of dietary ingredients, low maternal omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA) has increased the risk of persistent wheeze/asthma in offspring [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Low vitamin D levels increase susceptibility to virus-induced wheezing and severity of asthma. However, recommended supplementation has mainly abolished its effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Common protective factors of allergy and asthma include a healthy lifestyle (healthy nutrition, exercise, outdoor activities), diverse personal microbiome, non-polluted air, and environmental biodiversity, as well as contact with animal and farm dust.
