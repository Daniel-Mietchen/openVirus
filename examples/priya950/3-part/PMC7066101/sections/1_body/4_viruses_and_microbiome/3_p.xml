<p id="Par21">In addition, there is substantial evidence of the interaction between airway bacteria and viruses. In a study of acute respiratory symptoms in healthy and asthmatic children, rhinovirus was associated with increased detection of bacterial pathogens, and 
 <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> seemed to contribute to the severity of respiratory tract illnesses and asthma exacerbations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. At the epidemiological level, the seasonal peaks of several viral infections are associated with increased hospital admission for invasive 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. There are several mechanisms by which viral infections can increase the risk of bacterial infections, including immune suppression, epithelial damage, and changes in the local lung environment altering the growth conditions for pathogenic bacteria. But also the other way around, bacterial infection and/or colonization of the airways might increase the risk of later viral infection. Vaccination against 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> in a randomized trial resulted in subsequent reduced risk of virus-associated pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. There is also evidence of interaction between viruses and the microbiome in studies using a broader sequencing-based characterization, whereby both culturable and non-culturable bacteria can be detected. One study found an association between a nasopharyngeal microbiome characterized by 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and RSV hospitalization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], and another study found that a nasopharyngeal microbiome dominated by 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> in asymptomatic infants was associated with later wheezing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. These findings emphasize the importance of assessing both bacteria and viruses in studies of asthma etiology in order to address their individual roles and the impact of their interaction.
