<p id="Par19">As described above, there is evidence of a viral trigger in most acute asthma episodes. However, also, bacteria might play an important role in the pathology of acute asthma symptoms. As an example, young children with acute wheezy episodes had increased detection rates of the bacterial pathogens 
 <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> in hypopharyngeal aspirates [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], although this can also be due to anti-viral or anti-inflammatory effects of macrolides.
