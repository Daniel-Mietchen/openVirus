  <p>Long-term immunogenicity following PIZV vaccination. Both neutralizing antibody (
   <bold>a</bold>) and anti-Zika IgG titers were determined (
   <bold>b</bold>). Macaques were vaccinated on days 1 and 29 and challenged on day 371. Key time points include study day 1 (prior to vaccination), day 29 (28 days post-first dose), day 57 (28 days post-second dose), day 365 (prior to ZIKV challenge), and day 401 (30 days post-ZIKV challenge). Each line represents an individual macaque.
