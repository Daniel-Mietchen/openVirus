  <p>Neutralizing antibody titers negatively correlate with Zika vRNA peak value post-challenge. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Each point represents an individual macaque and respective neutralizing antibody titer (log
   <sub>10</sub> EC50) on day of ZIKV challenge (day 71) and peak ZIKV vRNA concentration (log
   <sub>10</sub> copies/mL) post-ZIKV challenge. For each macaque, the maximum Zika vRNA concentration observed over 10 days was plotted for analysis. Zika vRNA levels below the LLOQ are plotted as half of the LLOQ. The LLOQ is shown as a dashed line. To prevent overlaps among the points below the LLOQ, a small amount of variation has been added in the vertical direction. (
   <bold>b</bold>) To determine the correlate of protection, the neutralizing antibody titers (log
   <sub>10</sub> EC50) of infected (positive for vRNA at any given timepoint) and protected (negative for vRNA) macaques were plotted. The correlate of protection was defined as the maximum neutralizing antibody titer across all unprotected macaques in this study. Based on this definition, the correlate of protection was established as &gt;3.02 log
   <sub>10</sub> EC50. CoP = Correlate of protection.
