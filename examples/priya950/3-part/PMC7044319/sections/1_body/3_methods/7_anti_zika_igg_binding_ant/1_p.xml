<p id="Par25">Anti-Zika IgG antibody levels were measured for study days 1, 29, 57, and 71 (prior to ZIKV challenge) using a Luminex based anti-Zika IgG assay. Heat-inactivated serum samples were diluted 1:100 in assay buffer and then serially diluted 4-fold for an 8-point dilution curve. Magnetic beads covalently coupled with PIZV antigen were added to each sample dilution in a 96-well plate and each sample dilution was tested in duplicate. Plates were incubated on a plate shaker for 90 minutes at room temperature and then washed two times with assay buffer. Diluted anti-Ig-PE detection antibody was then added to each sample and incubated on a plate shaker for 1 hour at room temperature. After two wash cycles, beads were resuspended in assay buffer and read on the Luminex FLEXMAP 3D to measure the MFI. The IgG antibody concentration was quantified using a reference standard serum with an assigned IgG concentration in units/mL (U/mL). The LLOQ for the assay is 1.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> U/mL.
