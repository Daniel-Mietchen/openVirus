<p id="Par27">The mean neutralizing antibody titers (log
 <sub>10</sub> EC50) determined by Zika RVP assay was computed for each dose group at day 71 (day of ZIKV challenge). Zika vRNA copies/mL determined by RT-qPCR assay were computed for each dose and timepoint post-challenge (study days 71â€“81 and 84). Peak vRNA for each macaque was defined as the highest observed vRNA concentration across all timepoints tested. Macaques were considered protected if vRNA was not detected or was below the assay LLOQ for all timepoints tested. The correlate of protection was defined as the maximum neutralizing antibody titer across all unprotected macaques in this study. This definition was conservative in that some protected macaques could have neutralizing antibody titer levels below the correlate of protection due to overlap between the distributions of protected and unprotected macaques. Since the correlate of protection was not a statistical estimate, no confidence intervals were reported.
