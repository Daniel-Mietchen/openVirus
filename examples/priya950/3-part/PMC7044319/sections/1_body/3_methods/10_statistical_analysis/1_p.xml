<p id="Par28">Statistical tests were performed using the R software version 3.5.1.; log
 <sub>10</sub> neutralization titers were compared for selected pairs of days for each dose group using a paired two-sided t-test. At day 57, Tukey’s test was used to compare all dose groups with each other. A two-sided Spearman’s test was applied to the unprotected macaques to check for an association between Day 71 neutralizing antibodies titers and peak vRNA. Comparisons between selected pairs of days were also performed with the log
 <sub>10</sub> IgG antibody levels in the main study and with the log
 <sub>10</sub> neutralization titers from the long-term immunogenicity study using paired two-sided t-tests. A p-value threshold of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.
