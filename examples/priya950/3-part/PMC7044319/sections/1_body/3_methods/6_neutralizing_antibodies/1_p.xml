<p id="Par24">A Zika RVP assay (Sonnberg 
 <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript in preparation) was used to determine neutralizing antibody titers in serum following the administration of PIZV (study days 1, 29, 57, and 71), and 30 days post-ZIKV challenge (day 101). Briefly, macaque serum was heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 minutes and then serially diluted 3-fold in assay media for an 11-point dilution series. Diluted serum and RVP were plated in duplicate in a 384-well assay plate and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C. Vero cells were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 72 hours. Renilla-Glo substrate (Promega, WI, USA) was then added to the plate and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Finally, plates were analyzed by a luminometer. The effective concentration at 50% (EC50), was determined by a non-linear regression curve fit with the lower asymptote constrained to 0 in GraphPad Prism. The LLOQ for the NHP assay is 2.12 log
 <sub>10</sub> EC50, below which the serum matrix interfered with the measurement. The upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) of the standard assay is 5.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> EC50. Any samples returning titers &gt;ULOQ were retested with a higher initial pre-dilution.
