<p id="Par19">Thirty-five Indian rhesus macaques were separated into 6 groups. Three male and three female macaques per group were vaccinated intramuscularly with either 0.016, 0.08. 0.4, 2 or 10 µg PIZV on study days 1 and 29. To achieve statistical significance comparing vaccine doses, six animals/group were selected to obtain &gt;80% power if the true infection rate among controls is ≥90% and the true infection rate among vaccinated animals is ≤16% based on a one-sided Fisher’s Exact Test with 5% Type 1 error rate

 </sup>. Two male and three female macaques were vaccinated with placebo control (PBS) on study days 1 and 29. One female from the control group was euthanized on the day of ZIKV challenge due to reasons unrelated to the study, resulting in 4 macaques in the control group. Macaques were challenged subcutaneously with 10
 <sup>4</sup> ffu/0.5 mL ZIKV PRVABC59 on study day 71. Serum samples were collected and tested for antibody titers on study days 1, 29, 57, and 71, and 101, and for ZIKV RNA on study days 71–80, and study day 84.
