<p id="Par20">A second study was conducted to assess long-term PIZV immunogenicity and efficacy. Flavivirus seronegative male rhesus macaques (n = 4) were vaccinated with the 10 µg PIZV dose on days 1 and 29 and challenged subcutaneously with 10
 <sup>4</sup> ffu/0.5 mL ZIKV PRVABC59 on day 371. Serum samples were collected and tested for antibody titers monthly up to 1 year post-vaccination and 30 days following ZIKV challenge (study day 401). To assess replication of Zika vRNA following ZIKV challenge, serum samples were collected on study days 371–381, and 385.
