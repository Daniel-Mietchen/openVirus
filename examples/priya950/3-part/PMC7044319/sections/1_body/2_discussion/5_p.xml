 </sup> to demonstrate efficacy in prevention of ZIKV vRNA and to evaluate anamnestic antibody responses after ZIKV challenge in non-human primates. We did not assess presence of vRNA in tissues. Our working hypothesis is that prevention of serum ZIKV vRNA may be a surrogate for prevention of the most serious sequelae of ZIKV infection in humans - fetal infection. By employing a PIZV dose titration study design and a ZIKV RVP assay, we have established a minimum protective vaccine dose of 0.4 µg in rhesus macaques and established a neutralizing antibody correlate of protection against ZIKV challenge of 3.02 log
 <sub>10</sub> EC50. Finally, we demonstrated that ZIKV neutralizing antibodies persist and are capable of preventing ZIKV infection for at least 1 year post-vaccination. In the event that human phase 3 efficacy studies are not feasible, identifying a correlate of protection in an appropriate non-human primate challenge model may be important to support licensure of a Zika vaccine
