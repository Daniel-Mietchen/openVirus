<p id="Par13">We demonstrated that PIZV elicits a dose-dependent response of both Zika neutralizing and anti-Zika IgG antibodies. PIZV elicited neutralizing antibodies that persisted for at least 1 year and protected against ZIKV challenge. Vaccinating with a broad range of PIZV dose levels enabled us to correlate both neutralizing and anti-Zika IgG antibody titers to protection against ZIKV infection. We determined a neutralizing antibody correlate of protection of 3.02 log
 <sub>10</sub> EC50, which we define as the maximum EC50 among the unprotected animals in the study. We chose the neutralizing antibody assay to establish a correlate of protection as the literature supports using functional neutralizing antibodies as a correlate of protection for Zika and other flaviviruses.
