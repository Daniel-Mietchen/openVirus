<p id="Par15">In flavivirus vaccine development, neutralizing antibody titers that can confer protection against viremia have be reported in animal models using several different assay methods: microneutralization (MNT), RVP, and plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT). Studies of other candidate ZIKV vaccines have demonstrated that a neutralizing antibody titer as low as 100, using a MNT assay, or a titer of 1,000 using an RVP assay can confer protection against viremia in animal models

 </sup>. These results are qualitatively similar to those of licensed vaccines against flaviviruses such as JEV, where a neutralizing antibody titer of &gt;10 (as measured by PRNT) is considered to correlate with protection

 </sup>. Further supporting this correlate of protection, it has been reported that passive transfer of Zika neutralizing monoclonal antibodies or antisera from vaccinated humans and animals to mice is sufficient to protect against ZIKV challenge
