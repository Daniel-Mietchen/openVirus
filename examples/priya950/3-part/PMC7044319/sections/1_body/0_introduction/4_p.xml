<p id="Par5">To further evaluate immunogenicity and efficacy of PIZV, we conducted three ZIKV challenge studies in rhesus macaques. In the first study, we established a dose of PRVABC59 challenge virus. In the second study, we determined the immunogenicity and efficacy of a wide range of PIZV dose levels at 42 days after two PIZV vaccinations, to establish a potential antibody correlate of protection. In the third study, we assessed the persistence of immunity and efficacy 1 year following administration of the second PIZV dose, to evaluate neutralizing antibody kinetics and long-term protection.</p>
