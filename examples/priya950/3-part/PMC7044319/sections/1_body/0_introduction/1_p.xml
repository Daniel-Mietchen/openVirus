<p id="Par2">In 2015 and 2016, large outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) occurred in the Americas. These outbreaks were associated with clusters of congenital microencephaly and other severe neurological sequelae in infections in approximately 1 of 7 infants born to pregnant women with laboratory confirmed Zika in the US and US territories

 </sup>. With the sporadic nature of ZIKV outbreaks and a very low incidence of symptomatic disease in both endemic and non-endemic areas, conducting phase 3 clinical efficacy trials is not feasible. Still, the risk of re-emergence and the severe consequences of infection in pregnant women demonstrate that the need for an effective Zika vaccine remains. In such circumstances, alternative regulatory strategies such as Animal Rule approval or Accelerated Approval pathway may be relevant for licensure
