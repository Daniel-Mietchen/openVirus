<p id="Par3">Non-human primate studies have contributed to the development of ZIKV vaccines by demonstrating protective efficacy and identifying biomarkers of protection against ZIKV. Results to date have supported neutralizing antibodies as an immune marker that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit of several ZIKV vaccines
