<p id="Par10">PIZV elicited a dose dependent neutralizing antibody immune response and an anti-Zika IgG response which correlated with a reduction in ZIKV vRNA post-challenge (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). An immune correlate analysis was subsequently performed to correlate Zika vRNA with neutralizing antibody titers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and anti-Zika IgG (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which demonstrated that an increase in both neutralization antibody and anti-Zika IgG titers correlates with a decrease in vRNA concentration. Correlation with protection was observed with both neutralizing antibodies (3.02 log
 <sub>10</sub> EC50) and anti-Zika IgG (2.21 log
 <sub>10</sub> U/mL). We chose the functional assay, neutralizing antibodies, to establish a correlate of protection in macaques as a neutralizing antibody titer of &gt;3.02 log
 <sub>10</sub> EC50, which conferred protection against ZIKV serum viremia in Indian rhesus macaques. Due to overlap among the distributions of neutralizing antibody titers between the protected and infected animals, titers in some protected animals were below the correlate of protection.
