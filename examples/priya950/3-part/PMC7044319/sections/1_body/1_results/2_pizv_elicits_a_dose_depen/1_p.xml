<p id="Par7">Rhesus macaques were vaccinated with PIZV on days 1 and 29 and challenged on day 71. Serum neutralizing antibodies were tested using a Zika reporter virus particle (RVP) assay. All macaques were seronegative on day 1 and control macaques remained seronegative prior to ZIKV challenge (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Twenty-eight days following the first vaccine dose (study day 29), little or no seroconversion was observed for the 0.016 and 0.08 µg PIZV doses, while 4/6 macaques vaccinated with the 0.4 µg PIZV dose seroconverted and 6/6 macaques receiving the 2 and 10 µg PIZV dose seroconverted. Immune responses were boosted in all groups after the second dose (all p-values ≤0.001). Twenty-eight days after the second PIZV dose (study day 57), 100% of vaccinated macaques seroconverted. The magnitude of neutralizing antibody titers on day 57 was similar after the second dose of 0.4, 2, or 10 µg, with no statistically significant difference detected among these groups. The titer on day 57 was lower in the 0.016 (p = 0.003) and 0.08 µg groups (p = 0.037) compared to the 0.4 µg dose group. Titers prior to ZIKV challenge on day 71 were slightly decreased compared to day 57. Following challenge, neutralizing antibody titers increased significantly in the placebo, 0.016 and 0.08 µg groups (all p-values ≤0.004), but not in the 0.4, 2, and 10 µg groups. Neutralizing antibody levels after two PIZV doses of 0.4, 2, or 10 µg were similar to post-challenge neutralizing antibody titers in the placebo group. In conclusion, we observed a dose-dependent neutralizing antibody response to one or two doses of PIZV. After two PIZV doses, the neutralizing antibody levels reached a plateau for vaccine doses above 0.4 µg, and the level of neutralizing antibody was comparable to infection with ZIKV challenge in the placebo group. The lack of anamnestic antibody responses after challenge in the 0.4, 2, and 10 µg PIZV dose groups suggests that infection by ZIKV challenge virus may have been prevented by vaccination.
