<p id="Par8">In addition to evaluating neutralizing antibodies, we also quantified anti-Zika-specific IgG using a Luminex-based assay. As with neutralizing antibodies, all PIZV doses were immunogenic and no anti-Zika IgG was detected in the control group prior to ZIKV challenge. PIZV elicited dose-dependent anti-Zika IgG responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) in the vaccinated groups. Anti-Zika IgG responses were significantly boosted after a second PIZV dose for all vaccinated groups (all p-values ≤0.001). Following ZIKV challenge, the anti-Zika IgG responses increased significantly in the placebo, 0.016 and 0.08 µg groups (all p-values ≤0.035), but not in the 0.4, 2, and 10 µg groups. Similar to the neutralizing antibody response, the anti-Zika IgG titers following vaccination with the 0.4, 2, or 10 µg doses were similar to post-challenge anti-Zika IgG titers in the placebo group.
