<p id="Par6">We conducted a challenge study to select a ZIKV challenge dose that appropriately mimics human infection in Indian rhesus macaques. Macaques were challenged via subcutaneous injection with 0.5 mL containing either 10
 <sup>4</sup> focus forming units (ffu; n = 2) or 10
 <sup>5</sup> ffu (n = 2) ZIKV PRVABC59. Serum was collected daily for ZIKV RNA analysis by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), on days 1–11 post-infection (dpi), and every other day from day 13–21 dpi. Zika viral RNA (vRNA) was detected above the assay lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) between days 3–8 in the 10
 <sup>4</sup> ffu dose group and between days 2–6 in the 10
 <sup>5</sup> ffu challenge dose group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Macaques receiving the 10
 <sup>4</sup> ffu challenge dose had peak vRNA of 4.9 and 5.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL on days 4 and 5, while macaques in the 10
 <sup>5</sup> ffu group had peak vRNA of 4.8 and 5.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL, both on day 4. Zika vRNA was not detected above the assay LLOQ in the 10
 <sup>4</sup> ffu challenge dose group after day 8 or in the 10
 <sup>5</sup> ffu challenge dose group after day 6. The 10
 <sup>4</sup> ffu challenge dose was selected as it resulted in higher peak vRNA and longer duration of vRNA detection than the 10
 <sup>5</sup> ffu challenge dose.
