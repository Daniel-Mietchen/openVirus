<p id="Par11">To determine the kinetics of neutralizing antibodies over a year long period, a separate set of four male Indian rhesus macaques were vaccinated with 10 µg PIZV on study days 1 and 29 and challenged with ZIKV PRVABC59 on study day 371. Zika neutralizing antibody levels were measured every 28 days through day 365 (except for days 197, 309, and 337), as well as on day 401 (30 days post-ZIKV challenge). All macaques seroconverted following the first vaccine dose, with a significant boost in antibody titers following the second dose (p &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Neutralizing antibody titers peaked on day 57, 28 days following the second immunization, declined from day 57 to day 85, and then remained stable from day 85 to day 401. Anti-Zika IgG levels also peaked on day 57 and subsequently declined through study day 365 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). IgG titers increased following ZIKV challenge.
