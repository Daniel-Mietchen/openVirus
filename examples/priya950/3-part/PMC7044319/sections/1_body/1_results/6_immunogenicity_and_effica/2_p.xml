<p id="Par12">No Zika vRNA was detected in serum from any of the macaques following ZIKV challenge 1 year following the second dose. In addition, no statistically significant increase in neutralizing antibodies was observed post-ZIKV challenge on day 401 (log
 <sub>10</sub> EC50 range of 3.72–4.31 on day 365 compared to log
 <sub>10</sub> EC50 range of 4.00–4.49 on day 401). The combined results suggest that two doses of PIZV prevented ZIKV infection 1 year post-vaccination. In conclusion, two 10 µg PIZV vaccinations elicits persistent neutralizing antibodies and long-term protection in rhesus macaques.
