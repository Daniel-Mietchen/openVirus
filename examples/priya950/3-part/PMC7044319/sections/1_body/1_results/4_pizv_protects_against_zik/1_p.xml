<p id="Par9">Rhesus macaques were challenged subcutaneously on day 71 with 10
 <sup>4</sup> ffu PRVABC59. All macaques receiving the 0.4, 2, or 10 µg PIZV dose were protected against ZIKV challenge, as no Zika vRNA could be quantified in any of the macaques in these groups. Zika vRNA was quantified in 3/6 macaques receiving the 0.08 µg dose, 4/6 macaques receiving the 0.016 µg dose, and in all macaques in the control group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The peak post-challenge Zika vRNA level decreased with increasing vaccine dose level. The peak Zika vRNA occurred on day 74 (3 days post-challenge), with a geometric mean level of 5.1 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL in the control group (range 4.92–5.64 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL), 4.1 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL in the 0.016 µg dose group (range 4.10–5.00 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL) and 3.2 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL in the 0.08 µg dose group (range 2.98–3.33 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL). No clinical signs to the vaccine or challenge virus were seen throughout the studies.
