In this study we evaluated the antibody responses and efficacy of an aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted purified inactivated Zika vaccine (PIZV) against challenge with Zika virus (ZIKV) strain PRVABC59. Indian rhesus macaques received two doses of PIZV at varying concentrations ranging from 0.016&#x02009;&#x000b5;g &#x02212; 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g and were subsequently challenged with ZIKV six weeks or one year following the second immunization. PIZV induced a dose-dependent immune response that was boosted by a second immunization. Complete protection against ZIKV infection was achieved with the higher PIZV doses of 0.4&#x02009;&#x000b5;g, 2&#x02009;&#x000b5;g, and 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g at 6 weeks and &#x000a0;with 10 ug PIZV&#x000a0;at &#x000a0;1 year following vaccination. Partial protection was achieved with the lower PIZV doses of 0.016&#x02009;&#x000b5;g and 0.08&#x02009;&#x000b5;g. Based on these data, a neutralizing antibody response above 3.02 log<sub>10</sub> EC50 was determined as a correlate of protection in macaques. PIZV elicited a dose-dependent neutralizing antibody response which is protective for at least 1 year following vaccination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Infectious diseases</kwd><kwd>Vaccines</kwd><kwd>Inactivated vaccines</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority</institution></funding-source><award-id>HHSO100201600015C</award-id><award-id>HHSO100201600015C</award-id><award-id>HHSO100201600015C</award-id><award-id>HHSO100201600015C</award-id><award-id>HHSO100201600015C</award-id><award-id>HHSO100201600015C</award-id><award-id>HHSO100201600015C</award-id><award-id>HHSO100201600015C</award-id><award-id>HHSO100201600015C</award-id><award-id>HHSO100201600015C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Ginger</given-names></name><name><surname>Bohning</surname><given-names>Kelly J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zahralban-Steele</surname><given-names>Melissa</given-names></name><name><surname>Hather</surname><given-names>Greg</given-names></name><name><surname>Tadepalli</surname><given-names>Sambasivarao</given-names></name><name><surname>Mickey</surname><given-names>Kristen</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanisetty</surname><given-names>Srisowmya</given-names></name><name><surname>Sonnberg</surname><given-names>Stephanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Hetal K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dean</surname><given-names>Hansi J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Takeda Vaccines, Inc.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In 2015 and 2016, large outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) occurred in the Americas. These outbreaks were associated with clusters of congenital microencephaly and other severe neurological sequelae in infections in approximately 1 of 7 infants born to pregnant women with laboratory confirmed Zika in the US and US territories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Incidence of ZIKV infections subsequently declined in most of the Americas throughout 2017 and 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. With the sporadic nature of ZIKV outbreaks and a very low incidence of symptomatic disease in both endemic and non-endemic areas, conducting phase 3 clinical efficacy trials is not feasible. Still, the risk of re-emergence and the severe consequences of infection in pregnant women demonstrate that the need for an effective Zika vaccine remains. In such circumstances, alternative regulatory strategies such as Animal Rule approval or Accelerated Approval pathway may be relevant for licensure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Non-human primate studies have contributed to the development of ZIKV vaccines by demonstrating protective efficacy and identifying biomarkers of protection against ZIKV. Results to date have supported neutralizing antibodies as an immune marker that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit of several ZIKV vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Indian rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) are susceptible to ZIKV infection and have been used extensively as a model to study efficacy of ZIKV vaccines and pathogenesis of multiple ZIKV isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. ZIKV infection can be performed by subcutaneous injection, which mimics infection via mosquito bite and causes consistent viremia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The kinetics of ZIKV infection are similar in rhesus macaques and humans where serum or plasma viremia typically peaks within the first six days of infection and resolves within 10&#x02013;14 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The purified inactivated Zika vaccine (PIZV) has previously been evaluated in mouse models and was immunogenic in AG129 and CD1 mice and protected AG129 mice against lethal ZIKV challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In those studies, Baldwin <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection in AG129 mice. PIZV is currently being evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in phase 1 trials (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03343626).</p><p id="Par5">To further evaluate immunogenicity and efficacy of PIZV, we conducted three ZIKV challenge studies in rhesus macaques. In the first study, we established a dose of PRVABC59 challenge virus. In the second study, we determined the immunogenicity and efficacy of a wide range of PIZV dose levels at 42 days after two PIZV vaccinations, to establish a potential antibody correlate of protection.

All macaques were seronegative on day 1 and control macaques remained seronegative prior to ZIKV challenge (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Twenty-eight days following the first vaccine dose (study day 29), little or no seroconversion was observed for the 0.016 and 0.08&#x02009;&#x000b5;g PIZV doses, while 4/6 macaques vaccinated with the 0.4&#x02009;&#x000b5;g PIZV dose seroconverted and 6/6 macaques receiving the 2 and 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g PIZV dose seroconverted. Immune responses were boosted in all groups after the second dose (all p-values &#x02264;0.001). Twenty-eight days after the second PIZV dose (study day 57), 100% of vaccinated macaques seroconverted. The magnitude of neutralizing antibody titers on day 57 was similar after the second dose of 0.4, 2, or 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g, with no statistically significant difference detected among these groups. The titer on day 57 was lower in the 0.016 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003) and 0.08&#x02009;&#x000b5;g groups (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.037) compared to the 0.4&#x02009;&#x000b5;g dose group. Titers prior to ZIKV challenge on day 71 were slightly decreased compared to day 57. Following challenge, neutralizing antibody titers increased significantly in the placebo, 0.016 and 0.08&#x02009;&#x000b5;g groups (all p-values &#x02264;0.004), but not in the 0.4, 2, and 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g groups. Neutralizing antibody levels after two PIZV doses of 0.4, 2, or 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g were similar to post-challenge neutralizing antibody titers in the placebo group. In conclusion, we observed a dose-dependent neutralizing antibody response to one or two doses of PIZV. After two PIZV doses, the neutralizing antibody levels reached a plateau for vaccine doses above 0.4&#x02009;&#x000b5;g, and the level of neutralizing antibody was comparable to infection with ZIKV challenge in the placebo group. The lack of anamnestic antibody responses after challenge in the 0.4, 2, and 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g PIZV dose groups suggests that infection by ZIKV challenge virus may have been prevented by vaccination.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Neutralizing antibody titers following PIZV vaccination and ZIKV challenge.
