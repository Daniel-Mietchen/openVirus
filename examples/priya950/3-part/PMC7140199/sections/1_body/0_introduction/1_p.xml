<p>Influenza A is an enveloped virus belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae that comprises a negative-sense segmented RNA genome. Influenza viruses are extremely variable owing to a lack of proofreading during genome replication; therefore, mutations are continuously accumulated.

 </sup> Antigenic drift and antigenic shift are ongoing processes that result in the existence of a large amount of influenza viruses whose natural reservoirs include wild waterfowl and shorebirds.

 </sup> Reports indicate minimal evolution and apparent signs of disease in almost all natural reservoirs, but the occurrence of accumulated mutations in the genome or in certain fragments might benefit cross-species transmission.

 </sup> Influenza A viruses have the capacity to evolve rapidly and cause epidemics or even pandemics in domestic poultry, lower mammals, and humans. Avian influenza virus (AIV) transmission has been reported in several countries, with sporadic human infections owing to transfer of the virus from wild birds (e.g., migrating or wild aquatic birds) to domestic poultry.

 </sup> The first reported AIV infection in humans was caused by H5N1 virus and occurred in Hong Kong in 1997.

 </sup> Subsequently, AIVs have been continuously monitored and surveyed. Increasingly more new subtypes of AIVs have emerged in recent decades.
