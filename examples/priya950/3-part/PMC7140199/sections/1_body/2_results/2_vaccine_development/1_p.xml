<p>To reduce the mortality and morbidity rates of influenza virus infection, HA- and NA-specific neutralizing antibodies can be efficiently generated via vaccination. Early detection of neutralizing antibodies and rapid availability of the vaccine are required to prevent H7N9 pandemics. In the development of H7N9 vaccines, the peptides of HA7 and NA9 molecules of A/Shanghai/2/2013 or A/Anhui/1/2013 are considered the most promising candidates. These peptide vaccines are currently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials.</p>
