<p>Vaccination with a single dose of LAIV is known to be sufficient to stimulate an immune response against the homologous wild-type strain. Several human clinical trials are currently evaluating H7-based LAIVs.

 </sup> Previous outbreaks of A/mallard/Netherlands/12/2000 (H7N3) and A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7) were owing to avian-derived H7 strains. These strains have been found to be phylogenetically related to the HA of H7N9 viruses. Several previous reports have shown that serum from individuals vaccinated with these vector-based or inactivated vaccines cross-reacted with H7N9.

 </sup> Baculovirus-insect cell expression vectors used in the rapid production of insect cell recombinant antigens is a practicable strategy in the development of HA-based vaccines. Other viral vectors (e.g., adenovirus and poxvirus) are also used to prepare vaccines.

 </sup> The modified vaccinia virus Ankara and chimpanzee adenoviral ChAdOx1 vaccines are considered safe and immunogenic in humans for inducing long-term cross-reactive antibody against influenza A virus. These vaccines can be developed in a short time, to be used against emerging influenza strains. Moreover, an H7 and N9 molecule-containing vaccine, which is VLP-based from the A/Anhui/1/13 strain, has been reported to be producible by the baculovirus system.

 </sup> A dose of this VLP vaccine administered twice together with an adjuvant significantly increases the neutralizing ability of HA- and NA-inhibiting antibody.
