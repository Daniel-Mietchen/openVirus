<p>H7N9 AIV first appeared in China in 2013 as a new atypical strain arising as a result of either mutations or genetic reassortment of whole genome segments, including neuraminidase (NA) genes from wild birds in Korea, HA genes from duck H7 viruses, and internal genes derived from two distinct lineages of H9N2 viruses.

 </sup> More specifically, the new H7N9 virus is derived from multiple and sequential reassortment among HxN9, H7N3, and H9N2 viruses where the H7 and N9 subtypes are from H7N3 and HxN9 AIVs, respectively, which were subsequently transmitted to and began circulating in poultry.

 </sup> The H7N9 virus is known to evolve at a rapid rate. Currently, several emerging genotypes of H7N9 AIVs have been identified, including cocirculating low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and HPAI, causing infections in poultry and humans. Previous reports have indicated that in the first wave of the H7N9 influenza outbreak, a total of 27 genotypes were observed and documented between 2013 and 2014.

 </sup> The G0 genotype is predominantly found in human H7N9 infection whereas the G2, G4, and G5 genotypes are mainly detected in poultry. Most H7N9 genotypes were detected in the Yangtze River Delta area in China. More recent genotypic studies have identified dynamic reassortment of some internal genes among LPAI H7N9/H9N2/H6Ny and HPAI H7N9, as well as surface genes between the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta lineages, resulting in at least 36 genotypes identified in 2017.

 </sup> Among them, three main genotypes predominate, including G1 (A/chicken/Jiangsu/SC537/2013-like strain), G3 (A/chicken/Zhongshan/ZS/2017-like strain), and G11 (A/Anhui/40094/2015-like strain).
