<p>Clinical observation indicates that patients with severe H7N9 AIV infection have high serum levels of IP-10 and IL-6, which may reflect the severity of disease.

 </sup> In addition, the PB1-F2 protein of the influenza virus has been implicated in the regulation of polymerase activity, immunopathology, susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection, and the induction of apoptosis.

 </sup> Studies suggest that the PB1-F2 protein may assist in NLRP3-associated hyperinflammation in human H7N9 influenza virus infections via the formation of inflammasome in host cells. New treatment strategies for H7N9 PB1-F2-induced lung inflammation and cellular influx specifically target NLRP3 inflammasome formation, which may provide effective therapy to reduce the disease severity level and mortality rate in pathogenic H7N9 infection.
