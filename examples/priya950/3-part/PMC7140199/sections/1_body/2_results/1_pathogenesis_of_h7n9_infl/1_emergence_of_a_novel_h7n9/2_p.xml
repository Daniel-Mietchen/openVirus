<p>Most human cases of H7N9 AIV infection have been found in areas endemic for the virus.

 </sup> Closure of live poultry markets effectively controlled H7N9 epidemics in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Huzhou during the first wave of the H7N9 outbreak in China,

 </sup> This suggests that cases of human H7N9 AIV infection resulted from direct contact with infected poultry. Although animal-to-human transmission is the main route of infection, some studies have reported the possibility of human-to-human transmission using clusters of human cases and tracing data; however, these studies found very low basic reproduction number (R) estimates.

 <sup>
  <xref rid="bibr43-0300060519845488" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
 </sup> reported finding no evidence of reduced human-to-human transmission in the two outbreak waves associated with the closure of live poultry markets, indicating that higher basic R estimates were reported for the human-to-human transmission component. Despite the high susceptibility and occurrence of transmission among household or family members, it has not been well demonstrated that the H7N9 virus is capable of human-to-human spread.

 </sup> In addition, travelers also represent a potential risk factor in the dissemination of H7N9 AIVs from epidemic regions to non-epidemic areas.

 </sup> The WHO has suggested that the health status of international travelers returning from H7N9 epidemic areas should be assessed on arrival, and these individuals should be monitored or observed by health care workers for any apparent symptoms indicative of possible infection .

 </sup> Although imported cases of human H7N9 infection have been identified, the opportunity for spread at community level is unlikely as the virus has not adapted to humans.

 </sup> Furthermore, health advisories and communications should warn travelers to avoid exposure to poultry and raw poultry products while visiting affected areas. In people with a history of travel to affected regions, screening should begin within 2 weeks of departure, prior to the onset of acute respiratory illness. Patients are encouraged to disclose recent travel histories, and health care workers should obtain information regarding travel to affected areas.
