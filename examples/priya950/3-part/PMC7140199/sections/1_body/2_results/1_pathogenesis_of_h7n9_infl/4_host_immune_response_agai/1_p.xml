<p>The pathogenesis of human H7N9 virus that leads to severe outcomes remains unclear. Previous studies of HPAI H5N1 virus and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus have suggested that poor prognosis in human disease caused by these influenza viruses might be attributed to a cytokine storm or hypercytokinemia in the body.

 </sup> Some studies of H7N9 AIV have analyzed the cytokine and chemokine profiles in human serum samples from H7N9-infected patients. Reports have showed the presence of high levels of cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, IL-2, monocyte chemotactic protein (MIP)-1, the monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β, in the serum of patients infected with H7N9 AIV.

 </sup> Moreover, in patients with severe H7N9 infection, the expressed levels of IL-6 and IP-10 molecules are significantly higher than in asymptomatic patients with H7N9 infection.

 </sup> However, a previous study using BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse models assessed the pathogenicity of H7N9 virus, to examine the association of proinflammatory cytokines in lung injury and viral clearance. The findings of that study showed that TNF-α and IFN-γ suppress viral gene expression and increase viral clearance whereas IL-6 and MCP-1 contribute to lung injury in A/H7N9-infected mice.

 </sup> In summary, H7N9 viruses potently induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, and IL-7) and chemokines (IP-10), which contributes to the regulation of cellular immune responses. Alternatively, H7N9 infection also induces strong inflammatory responses, leading to tissue destruction.
