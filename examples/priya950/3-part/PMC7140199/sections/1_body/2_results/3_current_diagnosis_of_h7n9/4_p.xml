<p>Molecular PCR-based diagnostic tests are commonly performed in the detection and subtyping of H7N9 AIVs as these are faster than viral isolation and more sensitive than serologic tests. PCR-based diagnostic tests require RNA extraction using reagents to inactivate the virus; hence, the BSL requirements are lower than for viral isolation techniques. The extracted RNA is transcribed with reverse transcriptase to complementary DNA (cDNA), then amplified using specific primers for each subtype. With advanced technology, primers are now able to detect avian influenza A even if the virus is genetically varied.

 </sup> A recent advance in PCR-based detection methods for H7N9 AIV is the multiplex RT-PCR assay, which uses the GenomeLab Gene Expression Profiler (GeXP) analyzer, a multiplex gene expression analysis platform developed by Beckman Coulter.

 </sup> This assay simultaneously detects four NA serotypes of the H5 subtype. Both sensitivity and specificity are reportedly high; hence, this method can be useful in the detection, surveillance, and control of HPAI viruses.

 </sup> Detection techniques such as immunochromatographic RIDTs and PCR-based techniques greatly contribute to rapid, simple, and efficient screening and confirmation of cases of HPAI H7N9 infection. PCR-based methods further aid in the surveillance and control of HPAI H7N9 infection as this method has the advantages of speed, sensitivity, and specificity. We summarize the main tests performed in the diagnosis or confirmation of H7N9 virus in
