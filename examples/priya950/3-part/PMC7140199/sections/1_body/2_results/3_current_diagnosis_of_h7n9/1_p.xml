<p>The first three human cases of infection with influenza H7N9 virus were reported in February and March 2013 in mainland China.

 </sup> Respiratory specimens from these patients were analyzed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing analysis.

 </sup> Subsequently, cases were mostly confirmed using real time RT-PCR and in certain cases, viral isolation and serologic testing were also included.

 </sup> The proper collection and handling of specimen contributes to the quality of test results. The most acceptable specimens for diagnosis or identification of influenza A (H7N9) virus are nasal wash, nasal aspirate, sputum, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

 </sup> Throat swabs are not recommended owing to the low viral load in these specimens; higher viral loads are found in sputum and tracheal samples.

 </sup> The best time for sample collection is near symptom onset, within the first 3 days as viral shedding decreases after 4â€“5 days. However, shedding lasts up to 5 days in children.
