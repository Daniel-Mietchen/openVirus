<p>Currently, several methods are used in the diagnosis of H7N9 AIV. Routinely, rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are used along with other confirmatory tests such as viral isolation, serologic tests, and RT-PCR.

 </sup> RIDTs are widely used owing to their ease of use and quick results. RIDTs are based on antigen detection methods via the use of monoclonal antibodies, which attach to nucleoproteins on the targeted virus.

 </sup> Compared with molecular methods, RIDTs have low sensitivity.

 </sup> All RIDTs lack the capability of identifying or differentiating avian influenza subtypes. Because there are several different AIV subtypes, some more pathogenic than others, RIDTs that can differentiate between subtypes would greatly aid in screening, efficient diagnosis, surveillance, and control of HPAI.

 </sup> Such tests would also preclude the need for trained professionals to carry out testing. Although RIDTs only provide qualitative measures, the importance of obtaining a positive or negative result enhances efficient diagnosis, as positive samples can be sent for further analysis.
