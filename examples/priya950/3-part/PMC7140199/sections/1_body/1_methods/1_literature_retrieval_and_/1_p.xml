<p>In this review, we summarized the latest information the pathogenesis of H7N9 influenza virus in humans, vaccine development, and current laboratory assays for the diagnosis of infection with H7N9 AIV. This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, using systematic methods to identify and select eligible articles from PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. We used search strings containing a combination of terms including H7N9 influenza virus, diagnosis, vaccine, and pathogenesis. The systemic search covered publication dates between January 2013 and December 2018. Search results were limited to articles published in English language. Articles related to pharmacodynamics, clinical trials, and meta‐analyses were excluded. Full‐text articles were reviewed to assess their relevance and quality of the methodology. Articles with the following were excluded: insufficiently detailed materials and methods; small sample size (n ≤ 20); irrelevant or insufficient information related to the review objectives; articles reporting H7N9 influenza and other microbes as a combined outcome, use of bioinformatics or mathematical models; and no quantitative data could be retrieved. We also searched gray literature such as WHO websites and announcements, and local ministries of health and centers for disease control and prevention. A flow chart of the systemic literature search and article selection is shown in
