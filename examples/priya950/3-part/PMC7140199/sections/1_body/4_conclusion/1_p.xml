<p>Currently, H7N9 influenza virus is disseminated among aquatic birds and poultry, increasing their adaption and virulence in humans. Although this virus primarily exists in mainland China, increasingly more imported cases have been reported in other countries. Clinical H7N9 AIV isolates have been proven to have resistant to adamantine and oseltamivir, which are commonly used in influenza therapy. This highlights that new antiviral drugs, continuous genotype identification, and new vaccines against H7N9 influenza viruses are urgently needed. In addition, the development of accurate and rapid testing methods is necessary for the surveillance and control of H7N9 virus infections.</p>
