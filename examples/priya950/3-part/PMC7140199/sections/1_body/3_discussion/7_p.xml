<p>In prevention and prophylaxis of H7N9 AIVs, it is necessary to develop vaccines that can easily induce neutralizing antibody and generate CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells for virus neutralization and clearance, respectively. LAIV, H7 and N9 molecule-containing vaccine, and recombinant VLP vaccines based on A/Anhui/1/13 strain have shown effective stimulation of the specific immune response and no cross-reaction with other virus strains.

 </sup> Clinical trials and animal studies have revealed that much remains to be accomplished in the development of new vaccines, and their efficacy relies on targeting different phylogenetically related genotypic strains of H7N9 AIV.

 </sup> Human contact with infected poultry and global travel is unlikely to diminish, and the pathogenesis of H7N9 AIVs will likely persist. Therefore, strategies should be focused on understanding more about the impact of new therapies and prophylaxis to control circulating viruses.
