<p>Regarding drug use and design, targeting NLRP3 inflammosome formation may be effective in reducing the severity and mortality of H7N9 AIV infection, as humans lack immunity against H7 subtype influenza viruses. Some patients with H7N9 infection have shown poor outcomes with therapies such as M2 ion channel or NA blockers.

 </sup> In addition, some reports have indicated that H7N9 viruses acquire drug resistance against NA inhibitors via substitutions, which is correlated with amino acid substitutions; R292K confers the highest increase in oseltamivir half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>), E119D confers the highest IC
 <sub>50</sub> of zanamivir, and H274Y confers highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir.

 </sup> The need for new anti-influenza viral drugs is urgent. Testing some alternatives in H7N9 treatment is advisable, such as intranasal administration of ribavirin and baloxavir marboxil, as these have demonstrated effectiveness with other influenza viruses.
