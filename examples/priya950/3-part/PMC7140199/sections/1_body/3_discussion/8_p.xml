<p>Diagnostic tools or platforms with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of viral antigens or antibodies of H7N9 AIVs have been widely developed. Although viral culture is conventionally viewed as the gold standard in virological assays, real-time RT-PCR is currently suggested as an alternative gold standard as the former method requires specific BSL laboratory conditions and experienced staff. However, RIDTs are quick and easy to perform, so these tests have become essential at sites where real-time RT-PCR is unavailable. Current RIDTs have the capability of detecting strains of both influenza A and B. However, they have low sensitivity with new strains and are unable to differentiate between subtypes; therefore, the rate of false negatives is higher.

 </sup>RIDTs provide rapid detection of the presence or absence of viral analytes in patient samples; a major advantage of RIDTs is that results can be obtained within 15â€“30 minutes.

 </sup> As mentioned, there are several different subtypes of H7N9 AIVs circulating in China, some more pathogenic than others. With the advantage of speedy results, RIDTs that can differentiate between subtypes would provide a breakthrough for rapid screening and diagnosis, especially of HPAI H7N9 and AIVs such as H5N1.

 </sup> RIDTs can be performed at points-of-care for first-line influenza virus screening.

 </sup> This would help in patient diagnosis as well as the detection of asymptomatic cases or mild symptom cases, thus preventing further spread.
