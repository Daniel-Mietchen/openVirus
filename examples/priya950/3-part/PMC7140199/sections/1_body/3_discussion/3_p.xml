<p>Regarding virus-induced pathogenesis and pathology, H7N9 AIV infection causes mild to severe syndromes to humans owing to either LPAI or HPAI strains, as compared with infections in poultry, which are often asymptomatic when infection is with LPAI H7N9 strains. The major element for distinguishing HPAI and LPAI is determination of the amino acid profiles at the HA cleavage site. Increased basic amino acids have been proven to enhance the capability of maturation and replication of AIVs. The mechanism through which LPAI H7N9 viruses induce different pathogenesis in birds and humans is still not fully understood, suggesting that to determine the virulence of influenza A virus, it is critical to check the occurrence of variations or mutations in other viral proteins that are involved in virus replication and dissemination. Reports have indicated that H7N9 Asian lineage and H5N1 HPAI Asian lineage strains are mainly responsible for most cases of human illness worldwide to date, and these also result in the most serious illnesses and highest mortality. Clinical observation reports indicate that severe symptoms including viral pneumonia, hypercytokinemia, and even ARDS in cases of death owing to H7N9 AIV infection, which mainly occur in older people, as compared with H5N1 infection in which severe symptoms generally occur in younger patients.
