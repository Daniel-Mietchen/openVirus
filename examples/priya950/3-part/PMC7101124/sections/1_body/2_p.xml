<p>To determine the extent of ROCV circulation in different areas of Brazil, we screened 647 serum samples collected during an outbreak of dengue fever during 2011–2013. The samples came from patients in care units of the public health system, which offer 24-hour outpatient urgent care, and emergency services in the city of Goiânia, central Brazil. The samples were from patients of all age groups and sexes who exhibited signs and symptoms of suspected dengue infection. During the outbreak, the city reported ≈88,000 cases of DENV infection (
