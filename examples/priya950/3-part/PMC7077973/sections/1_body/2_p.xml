<p>The success of HIV prevention technologies such as HIV PrEP has prompted researchers to consider an analogous approach to STI prevention. A small number of studies have already shown potential effectiveness of STI PrEP and PEP.

 </sup> In 2015, a pilot study of daily doxycycline as syphilis PrEP in HIV-positive gbMSM in Los Angeles demonstrated a decrease in bacterial STIs compared with a contingency management intervention.

 </sup> Another randomized trial assessed doxycycline as STI PEP versus no intervention in 232 HIV-negative gbMSM and found that PEP significantly reduced the incidence of a first STI overall (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33–0.85), with similar results also seen for a first episode of chlamydia (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.70) and syphilis (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.07–0.98).

 </sup> However, these strategies are not without risk of side effects and may lead to antimicrobial resistance, leading many to express reservations about their appropriateness.

 </sup> Thus, it is important to assess current knowledge and opinions, as well as the acceptability of these emerging STI prevention techniques to predict potential uptake.
