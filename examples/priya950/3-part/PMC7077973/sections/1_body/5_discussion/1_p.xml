<p>This multicity study of at-risk Canadian gbMSM found that most participants (60.1%) were willing to use doxycycline-based PEP to prevent syphilis acquisition after a high-risk exposure, demonstrating fairly high acceptability of this STI prevention strategy within the population of interest. Willingness to use doxycycline-based PrEP was lower, at 44.1%. Because the definitions of doxycycline PEP and PrEP provided to participants only differed in dosing frequency (“1 antibiotic pill every day” versus “2 antibiotic pills within 24 hours after sex”), this discrepancy is likely explained by a preference for taking fewer pills. Other studies are consistent with this trend, with 52.7% of 2095 gay male survey participants in Australia willing to use syphilis PrEP,
