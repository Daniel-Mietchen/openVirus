<p>To date, neither of the published studies on doxycycline-based STI PrEP or PEP have formally evaluated the emergence of tetracycline class resistance in host normal flora, and the limited available data from 
 <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> and 
 <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> isolates in the doxycycline PEP trial has suggested no increase in resistance or resistance genes in the treated group. Data on these outcomes from planned and ongoing trials are thus eagerly anticipated.
