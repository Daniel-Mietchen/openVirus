<p>Participants' willingness to use HIV PrEP and PEP were considerably higher than for syphilis PrEP and PEP, at 74.0% and 75.2% respectively. These figures are similar to that of a prior study in Vancouver, which estimated interest in HIV PrEP to be 81% among MSM,

 </sup> This increase is not surprising, given the efforts to promote PrEP use in recent years. For instance, both Toronto and Vancouver have active community-based organizations that vocally support broader HIV PrEP and PEP rollout. Further, partial public funding for PrEP medication has been in place in Ontario since September 2017, whereas universal PrEP access for those meeting high-risk criteria has been available in British Columbia since January 2018. Work from our team has shown a significant positive association between the availability of public funding and population-level PrEP uptake.

 </sup> Together, these factors may suggest an increasingly favorable environment for the potential use of syphilis PrEP and PEP within the target population. Indeed, being a safe and affordable drug used in the treatment of many common infections, doxycycline is already publicly covered in both Ontario and British Columbia.
