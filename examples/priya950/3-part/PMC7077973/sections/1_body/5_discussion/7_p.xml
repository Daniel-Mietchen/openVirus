<p>Strengths of this study include our recruitment of participants from popular urban sexual health clinics, whose clientele likely reflect the sexually active gbMSM population to which future STI prevention efforts will be targeted, and our use of validated scales to assess HIV risk and syndemic conditions. Limitations include the potential for recall bias, particularly regarding questions about behaviors 6 months before participation (although the direction of such bias is unclear). The low number of HIV-positive participants precluded subgroup analyses by HIV status. In addition, data on willingness to use syphilis PrEP/PEP may not be an accurate indicator of future behavior. Further, because we did not specify the efficacy of syphilis PrEP/PEP in the wording of our questions, results may have been biased toward increased willingness if participants assumed these interventions would confer complete protection. Also, our descriptions of syphilis PrEP/PEP assumed quarterly bloodwork/clinic visits, mimicking the schedules being used in clinical trials and the recommended STI screening frequency for sexually active gbMSM according to Canadian guidelines, and thus findings may not reflect willingness to use these interventions under a different follow-up schedule. In addition, questionnaire items assessing awareness of antimicrobial resistance also did not distinguish between different organisms and their varying levels of resistance. Lastly, the demographic profile of the Vancouver and Toronto participants differed for several variables, including education, ethnicity, syndemic conditions, having a family doctor and previous STI diagnoses. Although the reasons for these differences are unclear since recruitment sites service similar populations, 1 potential reason could be participants in Vancouver were recruited only during daytime hours, while Toronto sites included evening hours as well.</p>
