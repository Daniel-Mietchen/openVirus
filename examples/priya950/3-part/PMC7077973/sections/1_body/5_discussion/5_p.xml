<p>Interestingly, although 89% of participants were aware of the concept of antimicrobial resistance, this knowledge was not associated with doxycycline PrEP and PEP acceptability. However, the potential for long-term doxycycline use to induce resistance in both normal host flora and in STI pathogens remains a major concern among clinical and public health stakeholders. Indeed, just months after the positive results of the IPERGAY substudy on doxycycline-based PEP were presented, Public Health England and the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV released a joint policy statement warning that the potential benefit of doxycycline PEP for STIs would be outweighed by the risk of antimicrobial resistance.
