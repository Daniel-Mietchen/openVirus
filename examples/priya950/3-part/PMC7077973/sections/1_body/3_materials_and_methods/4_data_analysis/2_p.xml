<p>To determine whether participant characteristics were associated with preferences for various STI prevention strategies, we built separate multivariable logistic regression models for willingness to use syphilis PrEP, syphilis PEP, HIV PrEP, and HIV PEP, using the total number of male sex partners within the last 6 months as the primary predictor variable. This choice of primary predictor variable was based on clinical judgment. All pertinent demographic, clinical, behavioral, opinion, and syndemic variables were considered for inclusion as covariates. The recruitment location variable was forced into all models to account for potential differences between Toronto and Vancouver participants. Variables were eligible for inclusion in the final model if they changed the primary predictor's beta-coefficient by at least 10% in adjusted versus unadjusted models and based on clinical judgment.

 </sup> To facilitate the interpretation of findings, we sought to include the same variables in the final PrEP and PEP models for each of syphilis or HIV. Finally, we used descriptive statistics to characterize knowledge and opinions regarding emerging STI prevention strategies. Missing data were excluded. Participants living with HIV were also excluded from both HIV models. All data analysis was conducted using R version 3.4.1.
