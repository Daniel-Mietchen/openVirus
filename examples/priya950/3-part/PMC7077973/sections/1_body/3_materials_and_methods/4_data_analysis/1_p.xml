<p>Characteristics of the study population were summarized using descriptive statistics. To achieve the primary objective, we calculated the proportion of participants responding “probably yes” or “definitely yes” to questionnaire items asking about their willingness to use hypothetical syphilis PrEP or syphilis PEP. The PrEP question was phrased as follows: “Syphilis PrEP would involve taking 1 antibiotic pill every day to prevent syphilis, and potentially chlamydia. It might cause side effects in some people such as mild stomach upset, and might increase the chance that future infections of all kinds could be harder to treat because of drug resistance (not just STIs). It would involve doing blood work and seeing a doctor every 3 months. If this strategy were approved in Canada and available to you, would you take it?” The question about PEP was identical, except for its definition: “Syphilis PEP would involve taking 2 antibiotic pills within 24 hours after sex.” We used a similar approach to assess willingness to use HIV PrEP and PEP.</p>
