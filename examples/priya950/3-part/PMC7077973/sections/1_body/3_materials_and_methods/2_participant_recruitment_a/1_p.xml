<p>We recruited consecutive, consenting gbMSM from community-based sexual health clinics in Toronto (1 site) and Vancouver (2 sites) during routine visits for sexual health services. Eligible participants had to be self-identified gbMSM of any age with sufficient English language proficiency. Data were collected from June to August of 2018 using a self-administered, anonymous questionnaire. The survey was preceded by a short letter of information, and participants who completed the survey were deemed to have provided implied consent. The questionnaire was administered via paper or electronic tablet, with a trained research assistant present to answer questions. Participants were compensated with a $10 CAD gift card.</p>
