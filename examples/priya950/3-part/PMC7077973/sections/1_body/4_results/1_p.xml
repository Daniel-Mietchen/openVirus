<p>Overall, 436 participants were recruited from community-based sexual health clinics in Toronto (n = 242) and Vancouver (n = 194). A refusal log was kept at the Toronto site only, showing that 20 additional individuals were approached but declined to participate; these individuals had similar age and gender identity compared with included participants (data not shown). Of the 436 men who completed the survey, 12 were subsequently excluded because they did not meet inclusion criteria (n = 9) or because primary outcome data were missing (n = 3), yielding a final sample of 424 participants.</p>
