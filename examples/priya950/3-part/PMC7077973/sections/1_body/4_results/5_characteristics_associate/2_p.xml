<p>Several variables were significantly associated with willingness to use both HIV PrEP and PEP in multivariable models. Willingness decreased with age (PrEP aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–0.9 and PEP aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6–1.0), increased with the number of different STIs previously diagnosed (PrEP aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3–2.1 and PEP aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2–1.9), was higher in Toronto than Vancouver (PrEP aOR, 4.3a; 95% CI, 2.2–8.5 and PEP aOR, 6.4; 95% CI, 3.2–12.9) and was higher in those with prior knowledge of HIV PEP (PrEP aOR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2–4.4 and PEP aOR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2–4.6). In addition, problem alcohol use appeared to be associated with willingness to use HIV PrEP but did not quite reach statistical significance (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0–3.5), whereas Asian ethnicity (aOR = 2.1 compared to White participants; 95%CI = 1.1,4.2) was significantly associated with willingness to use HIV PEP.</p>
