<p>Significant predictors for willingness to use syphilis and HIV PrEP/PEP varied (Tables 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In multivariable analyses, willingness to use syphilis PrEP was significantly associated with being “very concerned” about STI acquisition (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1–3.4), having ever used HIV PrEP (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1–4.3), and although not statistically significant, it appeared to be associated with a higher number of different STIs previously diagnosed (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.98–1.3) and agreement with the statement “I am at risk for syphilis” (aOR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0–2.5). Interestingly, variables that are more traditionally related to syphilis risk, such as the total number of sex partners and a prior diagnosis of syphilis were not significantly associated with willingness to use syphilis PrEP in this analysis. In fact, the total number of sex partners, our primary predictor of interest, was not associated with interest in either syphilis PrEP or PEP. Willingness to use syphilis PEP was only significantly associated with a higher number of previously diagnosed STIs (aOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2–1.7) and being in the Toronto rather than Vancouver sample (aOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2–3.4).
