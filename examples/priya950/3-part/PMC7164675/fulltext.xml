Disentangling the socio-ecological mechanisms by which ecosystem change precipitates impacts of pathogens is critical for predicting disease risk and designing effective intervention strategies. Despite the global &#x0201c;One Health&#x0201d; initiative, predictive models for tropical zoonotic diseases often focus on narrow ranges of risk factors and are rarely scaled to intervention programs and ecosystem use. This study uses a participatory, co-production approach to address this disconnect between science, policy and implementation, by developing more informative disease models for a fatal tick-borne viral haemorrhagic disease, Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), that is spreading across degraded forest ecosystems in India. We integrated knowledge across disciplines to identify key risk factors and needs with actors and beneficiaries across the relevant policy sectors, to understand disease patterns and develop decision support tools. Human case locations (2014&#x02013;2018) and spatial machine learning quantified the relative role of risk factors, including forest cover and loss, host densities and public health access, in driving landscape-scale disease patterns in a long-affected district (Shivamogga, Karnataka State). Models combining forest metrics, livestock densities and elevation accurately predicted spatial patterns in human KFD cases (2014&#x02013;2018). Consistent with suggestions that KFD is an &#x0201c;ecotonal&#x0201d; disease, landscapes at higher risk for human KFD contained diverse forest-plantation mosaics with high coverage of moist evergreen forest and plantation, high indigenous cattle density, and low coverage of dry deciduous forest. Models predicted new hotspots of outbreaks in 2019, indicating their value for spatial targeting of intervention. Co-production was vital for: gathering outbreak data that reflected locations of exposure in the landscape; better understanding contextual socio-ecological risk factors; and tailoring the spatial grain and outputs to the scale of forest use, and public health interventions. We argue this inter-disciplinary approach to risk prediction is applicable across zoonotic diseases in tropical settings.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Worldwide, impacts of zoonotic diseases, that cycle between animals and people, are concentrated in tropical communities and often linked to the way people use and change ecosystems. Interventions for zoonotic diseases could be targeted better using risk maps based on computer models that integrate social and ecological risk factors across degraded ecosystems. However, such predictive models often perform poorly at local scales, incorporate narrow ranges of risk factors, and are disconnected from policy, managers and interventions. Co-production brings together stakeholders and knowledge, across the human health, animal health and environmental sectors, aligning with the OneHealth Initiative, to develop more informative predictive tools for zoonotic diseases. Through co-production, we develop predictive models for a fatal tick-borne disease, Kyasanur Forest Diseases (KFD) that is spreading across the degraded Western Ghats forest in India. These models incorporating contextual risk factors identified by stakeholders, accurately predicted patterns in human cases of KFD (2014&#x02013;2018) in Shivamogga district, Karnataka State, and identified new hotspots of infection during the subsequent 2019 outbreak. Landscapes at highest risk encompassed diverse forest-plantation mosaics with high coverage of moist evergreen forest and plantation, high indigenous cattle density, and low coverage of dry deciduous forest. Co-production resulted in outbreak data that reflected where exposure occurred in the landscape and outputs of value for targeting of interventions, matched to the scale of forest use and public health interventions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Medical Research Council UK</institution></funding-source><award-id>MR/P024335/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5140-2710</contrib-id><name><surname>Purse</surname><given-names>Bethan V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Natural Environment Research Council, UK</institution></funding-source><award-id>NE/R000131/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5140-2710</contrib-id><name><surname>Purse</surname><given-names>Bethan V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>The Wellcome Trust DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/CPHI/16/1/502648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srinivas</surname><given-names>Prashanth N.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The MonkeyFeverRisk project that led to these results is supported by the Global Challenges Research Fund and funded by the MRC, AHRC, BBSRC, ESRC and NERC [grant number MR/P024335/1], awarded to BVP, SLH, MVM, MMC, PNS, JY, SJB, MO, AV, FG, and GK.

Communities affected by zoonoses often depend on surrounding ecosystems for livelihoods and food security. In India, for example, around 300 million people depend directly on degraded forest ecosystems for food, fuel, livestock fodder and other non-timber forest products (NTFPs)[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A key cost of altering forest structure and accessing forest goods and services is the increased exposure of humans and livestock to multi-host zoonotic pathogens [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Forest habitats and their ecotones are a significant source of emerging and re-emerging infections because they support complex ecological communities, including high wildlife host and vector diversity [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Upsurges in incidence of several high burden zoonotic diseases have been linked to deforestation or reforestation in LMICs (e.g. malaria[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Leishmaniases [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever Virus) and to forest dependence. Living in or near forests has been linked to unfair accumulation of geographic and social disadvantages including political and economic marginalisation [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Forest communities are rendered even more vulnerable by their remoteness from healthcare infrastructure [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Disentangling the ecological and social mechanisms by which changes in forest habitat can precipitate impacts of multi-host pathogens is critical for the design of effective intervention strategies.</p><p>Integrating land use patterns, ecosystem and social factors into interpretations of past disease patterns at a range of geographical scales [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] can indicate potential mechanisms and facilitate prediction of disease risk across new landscapes or for the same landscapes under future alternative environmental and development policies [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Conceptual frameworks, like the global &#x0201c;One Health&#x0201d; paradigm, recognise the interconnectedness of human health, wildlife and domestic animal health and the environment[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite this, models of zoonotic disease risk in tropical regions have often focussed on a single set of processes that drive variability in disease risk and effectiveness of interventions ([<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but see [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). For example, published risk maps and spatial decision support tools for tick-borne zoonoses tend to focus on mapping environmental hazard (or presumed correlates of environmental hazard like tick abundance or presence[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]), but often do not integrate the social factors which drive patterns in exposure [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Tools and maps are rarely linked to intervention programs at a scale appropriate to sources of epidemics[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and ecosystem use. Leach &#x00026; Scoones [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] recommend instead that disciplines, data and models are not only integrated, but &#x0201c;triangulated&#x0201d; with deliberation around framing assumptions, policy narrative, politics and values. The process of co-production is ideally suited to the development of models to understand and predict zoonotic diseases. Co-production is based on the need to integrate different forms of knowledge into decision-making. It involves active engagement of stakeholders from different sectors and scales as knowledge holders and future model users through three key stages of framing the problem, knowledge integration and experimentation [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In our inter-disciplinary One Health Indo-UK partnership, the MonkeyFeverRisk project[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], co-production is used to improve understanding and develop decision support tools for a fatal tick-borne zoonotic disease, Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), that is spreading across degraded Western Ghats forest ecosystems in India.</p><p>Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus (KFDV; family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) causes debilitating and fatal haemorrhagic disease (around 500 cases p.a., up to 10% mortality[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]) in forest communities. Key affected groups include small-holder farmers engaged in cultivation and grazing of cattle in forests [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], forest-dependent tribal communities who gather NTFP, day labourers in plantations and State forest department workers[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>As well as affecting diverse human communities, the transmission cycle of KFDV is complex. KFDV cycles between different life stages of tick species from several genera (principally <italic>Haemaphysalis</italic> but also some <italic>Ixodes</italic> species) and amplifying vertebrate hosts including wild rodents and shrews, monkeys and some birds [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Humans contract KFDV when bitten by an infected tick, but are incidental hosts for the disease. Monkeys, principally the black-footed grey langur (<italic>Semnopithecus hypoleucos</italic>) and the bonnet macaque (<italic>Macaca radiata</italic>), are thought to act as amplifying hosts, by infecting large numbers of larval ticks with the virus [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Cattle do not amplify KFD since they do not develop viraemia of long duration [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but may amplify tick populations through their importance as a blood meal host.</p><p>The emergence of KFD in humans has been widely linked to human modification of the forest ecosystem through deforestation [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The initial epidemics in Karnataka in the 1950s and those in the 1980s were preceded by population increases and extensive deforestation, to make way for plantations (such as Areca and cashew), paddy cultivation, housing and roads. This created mosaic tropical evergreen and deciduous forest, interspersed with cultivation (e.g. paddy), and interface scrub habitat between villages and forests that was conducive to both tick populations and cattle grazing [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These conditions are hypothesised to have facilitated the emergence of KFDV into humans from a cryptic sylvatic enzootic cycle involving small mammals and monkeys [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, it is still unknown how tick vectors and potential amplifying vertebrate hosts are linked to different habitats and to human exposure within agro-forest mosaics.</p><p>Human epidemics were restricted to focal areas of Karnataka State from 1957 to 2012, but since then human cases have been detected in four neighbouring states (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa and Maharashtra)[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Human serological evidence indicates wide KFDV circulation in other states across India (Gujarat, West Bengal, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands) and on the border with China. Therefore, the landscape conditions favouring KFDV transmission are widespread [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and the subset of these conditions that lead to human disease impacts, need to be delineated urgently. KFD impacts are managed currently through vaccination, awareness campaigns and promotion of tick protection measures in and around recently affected areas. However, constraints on availability and efficacy of the vaccine, and reluctance of local communities to be vaccinated and adopt personal protection measures can exacerbate epidemics [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus targeting of interventions towards the most vulnerable communities is critical.</p><p>This paper describes the co-production&#x02013;with actors and beneficiaries across the public health, animal health and forestry sectors&#x02013;of the landscape-level spatial models and understanding of risk factors for a case study zoonotic disease, Kyasanur Forest Disease. The model is developed for Shivamogga district in Karnataka, which has been affected by KFD since the 1950s, and reports a high proportion of India&#x02019;s human cases (e.g. 656 or 34% of 1929 cases reported between 2010 and 2019). Because of this, health managers of this district have long experience in disease surveillance and control. Using point locations for human cases recorded at sub-village level by health managers between 2014 and 2018, spatial Boosted Regression Tree models [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] are used to quantify the relative role of forest characteristics and loss, topography, host densities and public health factors in driving patterns in KFD at the landscape scale.</p><p>The co-production process involved framing potential key risk factors for KFD with cross-sectoral managers [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Spatial proxies of these risk factors were integrated into the model framework. The spatial grain of the model and its output was tailored to the scale at which people use forests (from household surveys) and the scale at which public health managers collect and report outbreak data. The models were then validated during the 2019 outbreak season with health managers, in terms of their predictive accuracy and utility for management.</p><p>Furthermore, through geographical thinning [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the model framework accounted for the sparse, spatially clustered recording effort that often arises in public health surveillance datasets[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We discuss the extent to which disease patterns were predictable from landscape, topographical host and landscape metrics, whether human cases of KFD are associated with particular forest types, mosaic habitats or forest loss and how model predictions could improve targeting of interventions and surveillance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The protocols for this study were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Institute of Public Health (IPH IEC), Bangalore (Study ID, IEC-FR/04/2017) and received a Favourable Ethical Opinion from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee (research protocol 17/062).

Designated laboratories for processing human samples of KFD from Shivamogga District include the Virus Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL), Shivamogga, the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune and Manipal Centre for Virus Research. Human cases, arising from samples testing positive for Kyasanur Forest Disease by RT-PCR or IgM ELISA in either laboratory in the five years between the December 2013 / May 2014 and December 2017 / May 2018 outbreak seasons, were compiled by co-author, Dr S. K. Kiran, who served as Taluka Medical Officer for Tirthahalli from 2010&#x02013;2019. Cases were assigned to locations retrospectively using Google Earth, following personal visits to households of affected patients conducted by Dr Kiran, or Medical Officers in other talukas, during the outbreak seasons. These locations were marked on Google Earth to retrieve the geographical coordinates in Latitude and Longitude to an estimated spatial precision of around 300 m. Cases of febrile illness may be reported to Primary Health Centres and from home addresses that are very distant from where infection is acquired. For example, migrant agricultural labourers work in plantations and pilgrims visiting temples in forest areas that can be 10s to 100s of kilometres from their homes [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Based on case-tracing that Taluka Medical Officers had performed during the outbreak seasons, such cases (&#x0003c; 10) could be excluded from the analysis. In total, 329 cases from 117 different household or village locations were compiled over the five transmission seasons (144 cases from 2013/2014, 32 from 2014/2015, 32 from 2015/2016, 89 from 2016/2017, 32 from 2017/2018). The presence and number of cases were summarised at a 1 km x 1 km and 2 km x 2 km grid resolution across Shivamogga, resulting in 65 (of a total of 7732) land cells and 53 (of a total of 1926) land cells positive for KFD respectively at these study grains. These two study grains were chosen to reflect the range of distances from households at which forest users may acquire infection from forest habitats during their livelihood activities. Interviews with members of similar forest communities in Wayanad, Kerala revealed that forest users move between 1 and 4 km through forest habitats from their homes during the main risk KFD period(January to March, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s002">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>During the 2018/2019 transmission season in Shivamogga District, households with cases throughout Shivamogga District were geo-located as a passive independent validation dataset. Between 21 November 2018 and 16 June 2019, 344 human cases of KFD were reported across 104 villages, causing 20 deaths. The majority of these cases (212 cases or 61%) and 17 deaths were concentrated in a new geographical focus in Sagara taluka in northern Shivamogga (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008179.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, closed red circles). This area had reported no human cases and only one or two human or tick positives in the 2014/2015 and 2017/2018 season during the prior decade. Geo-location of affected households was achieved directly in the field using the Smartphone Android App &#x0201c;AndLocation&#x0201d; or by health workers who shared their live location on WhatsApp with project staff for transfer to Google Earth and retrieval of coordinates. These 2018/2019 season cases spanned 84 of the 1 km grid cells and 68 of the 2 km grid cells. They provided an ideal test of whether the risk maps developed before the transmission season (using human cases data from the prior five transmission seasons) are capable of predicting new outbreaks, including new geographical foci like the one in Sagara taluka.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Framing key socio-ecological risk factors for KFD with stakeholders</title><p>The participatory MonkeyFeverRisk Framing workshop was held on 16th August 2018 in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.

highest ranked environmental risk factor for KFD by stakeholders, consistent with scientific literature linking forest loss and creation of mosaic forest-paddy-scrub village habitat to human emergence events [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Stakeholders considered that abrupt shifts in land use between forest and village areas made communities more vulnerable to KFD. Metrics of forest change considered in the analysis were area of forest loss and gain since 2000 per grid cell derived from Hansen et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Area of forest gain was highly collinear with area of forest loss (Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient, r = 0.968), and much less prevalent (making up 0.16% versus 1.2% of 30m land pixels), so was excluded from the analysis. To quantify mosaic habitat, the amount and diversity of different forest types, of agricultural or fallow land and plantation and overall land use diversity were extracted from the MonkeyFeverRisk Land Use Land Cover map (LULC map), derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery (2016&#x02013;2017) as detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s005">S4 File</xref>. Edge metrics for forest types were also calculated as a measure of the amount of interface habitat between forest, agriculture and villages but were highly collinear with amount of individual forest types and so were not included in the final analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s004">S3 File</xref>).</p><p>Stakeholders also ranked human use of forests and living in/around forests as key risk factors. They identified policies (or poor policy implementation) linked to grazing and encroachment in and around forest areas as increasing the risk of KFD. This is consistent with case-control studies that have linked grazing cattle inside forests, handling cattle and gathering of dry leaves for animal bedding to higher exposure to KFD [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the hypothesised role of cattle in amplifying tick populations. Available spatial proxies for extent of forest use for grazing were the densities of indigenous cattle (since smallholders in Shivamogga keep indigenous breeds) and buffalos per grid cell.</p><p>Again consistent with literature [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], diverse public health factors were ranked by stakeholders as key risk factors for KFD (<xref rid="pntd.0008179.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) such as lack of awareness of KFD and preventative measures, low acceptance and coverage of vaccination, poor diagnostics and surveillance including under-reporting of human cases or monkey deaths. Available spatial proxies of access to health services and education and surveillance effort, developed from Indian Government census data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s004">S3 File</xref>), were the proximity to a primary health centre, overall human population size and the number of medics available per head of population at village level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s004">S3 File</xref>). Some risk factors like poor data management, low vaccine uptake and under-reporting of monkey deaths by the Forest Department, will be less well linked to such spatial proxies.</p><p>Consistent with literature linking tick demography and host-seeking behaviour to micro-climatic factors [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], stakeholders also mentioned suitable micro-climates for tick populations among key risk factors for KFD (<xref rid="pntd.0008179.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, available gridded weather station data is too coarse in resolution to define spatial variation in climate at village to district levels. Topographical factors, namely slope and elevation, and associated vegetation types from the LULC map were considered to be better proxies of micro-climatic conditions at village and district scale. Small water bodies of around 10m<sup>2</sup> were hypothesised by disease managers to be key locations in the landscape where monkeys carrying KFD, nymphal ticks and grazing animals might co-occur. Conversely, large water-bodies could constitute barriers to dispersal of wildlife hosts for tick vectors and KFD, and in turn, to epidemic spread [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The LULC map is based on 30 m resolution Landsat data, thus only detects water-bodies of larger than 30m. Thus, the coverage of such larger water-bodies per grid cell was included a priori amongst predictors, with the expectation that high coverage of such water-bodies would be unfavourable for KFD.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Modelling the distribution of Kyasanur Forest Disease with Boosted Regression Trees</title><p>A boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] framework was used to determine the sensitivity of patterns in human KFD cases to land use, topographical and host variability, and to generate maps of potential distribution across Shivamogga. BRTs combine regression trees, which build a set of decision rules on the predictor variables by portioning the data into successively smaller groups with binary splits [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and boosting, which selects the tree that minimises the loss of function, to best capture the variables that define the distribution of the input data. BRTs have been shown to have high performance amongst methods used to predict species distributions [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], probably due to their ability to fit complex, non-linear responses to environmental covariates and their robustness to outliers. However, they can be prone to over-fitting data and therefore a number of stringent cross-validation checks were used to avoid this (see below).</p><p>Due to the high degree of spatial clustering in the case presence data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008179.g002">Fig 2</xref>), it was clear that this presence data should be thinned prior to analysis to avoid inflation of model accuracy and pseudo-replication of particular environmental conditions in the model [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Presence data can be thinned in geographical or environmental space [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The lack of quantitative information on the environmental drivers of KFD makes it difficult to select key environmental axes by which to thin the data. Thus thinning in geographical space was conducted. A rule of thumb is to take the peak distance between pairs of presence records (this is 10 km for KFD in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and thin the points so that they are no closer than half this distance (~ 5 km for KFD), ensuring that there is only 1 presence in each 5 km grid cell. Thus, at each resolution (1 km grid cell and 2 km grid cell), we randomly selected one of the presence records per 5 km grid cell, for each of the 30 x 5 km grid cells in which presence records were found. The whole process was repeated 100 times to generate 100 presence datasets at each resolution.</p><fig id="pntd.0008179.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0008179.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Key landscape predictors of presence of Kyasanur Forest Disease (1 km resolution) overlaid with point locations of human cases from 2014 to 2018 (black dots).).</title><p>These are proportional areas of moist evergreen forest, dry deciduous forest, and plantation per grid cell and forest type diversity. These metrics were derived from analysis of the MonkeyFeverRisk LULC map (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s004">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s005">S4</xref> Files).

White areas in Bhadravathi taluka in southeast corner indicate no data.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pntd.0008179.g002"/></fig><p>Absence data: Since Boosted Regression Trees require both presence and absence data, the presences were matched with an equal number of selected absence grid cells as recommended by Barbet-Massin et al.[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] for BRTs. When selecting absence data, it is important to try to mimic the recording process that gives rise to the presence data. For example, human cases of KFD tend to be reported from rural land areas and communities. Therefore very large water bodies and built-up areas like towns and cities were excluded from the absence selection process by including only 1 km or 2 km grid cells encompassed by the census village boundaries in the selection area. Cells containing presences were also removed from the selection area at each resolution. We then randomly selected 30 absence cells at each resolution, each of which occurred in a different 5 km grid cell, and this process was repeated 100 times to generate 100 absence datasets. Each presence dataset was combined with one of the absence datasets to generate 100 presence-absence datasets at each resolution.</p><p>Due to the disparity between local land use maps and global forest loss data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s004">S3 File</xref>), at each resolution, a set of 100 BRT sub-models was fitted to all environmental predictors and another set fitted to all predictors except area of forest loss. Models were fitted using the gbm.step function of the dismo package in R [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Model settings were as follows: learning rate = 0.001; tree.complexity = 4; bag rate = 0.6; to allow two way interactions between environmental predictors and to ensure that optimum number of trees always exceeded 1000. The gbm.step function automatically identifies the optimum number of trees for a BRT model using ten-fold cross-validation, selecting the number of trees that minimises hold-out deviance (cross-validation deviance) across folds. In addition to the cross-validation deviance, gbm.step reports several metrics of model performance in cross-validation across folds including; (i) the Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve Statistic (AUC) on hold-out dataset [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], or cross-validation AUC, where an AUC value of 0.5 indicates no discriminative ability between presence and absence, and a value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination; (ii) cross-validation coefficient, which is the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient between the predicted probability of presence and the true presence/background for the hold-out dataset. We report the mean, median and standard deviation of these metrics across the 100 BRT sub-models in each model set. This provides a full picture of the average performance and consistency across each model set. The true prevalence of the disease across the study region is unknown, and the models are parameterised with ad hoc presence data combined with selected pseudo-absences rather than true absences. Therefore, the models predict the relative rather than absolute probability of presence between cells. This model fitting process was repeated at each resolution for the two sets of environmental predictors as above, giving rise to four different model runs- 1 km with forest loss, 1 km without forest loss, 2 km with forest loss, and 2 km without forest loss.</p><p>Relative contribution statistics of predictor variables are reported only for the BRT model with the optimum number of trees (not for the folds). Relative importance is defined as the number of times a variable is selected for splitting, weighted by the squared improvement to the model as a result of each split and averaged over all trees [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These contributions are scaled to sum to 100, with a higher number indicating a greater effect on the response. Again, we report the average of these values across the 100 BRT sub-models.</p><p>The direction of the association between human cases of KFD and particular predictor variables was evaluated from the response curves produced from the BRT model. The response curves for a predictor were averaged across the 100 BRT sub-models by calculating mean and standard deviation of the marginal predicted probabilities within ~40 bins of the predictor values.</p><p>The extent to which geographical thinning was successful in removing spatial autocorrelation caused by clustering of presence records was examined by plotting correlograms of the residuals of each fitted sub-model using the correlog function in the ncf package in R [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The Moran&#x02019;s I values and significance values were then averaged across sub-models within different distance bins (from 0 to 80 km in increments of 5 km), to look for evidence of systematic positive spatial autocorrelation.</p><p>To predict the distribution of KFD across Shivamogga in unsampled areas, each BRT sub-model was applied to the prediction layers for a given resolution and environmental set using the predict.gbm function of the gbm package in R [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The predicted relative probability of presence was averaged across sub-models to produce an ensemble mean &#x000b1; standard deviation of the relative probability of presence per grid cell. For each BRT model, the threshold relative probability of presence that maximises discrimination between presence/background for the hold-out dataset was calculated by gbm.step and averaged across folds (cross-validation threshold). Occurrence patterns were summarised across sub-models by converting the predicted distributions to binary presence-absence maps per sub-model using the mean cross-validation threshold relative probability of presence for each sub-model, and counting the number of times a cell was predicted to be present across the 100 sub-models. The predicted extent of occurrence in terms of number of study grid squares or pixels was calculated for each predictor resolution and environmental set. The geographical extent of predictions was limited to the region for which the environmental predictors were available and, out of necessity, omitted very large water-bodies and areas classified as towns or cities in the census.</p><p>Independent validation of models was achieved using the presence points from the 2018/2019 outbreak, by calculating the predicted-to-expected (P/E) ratio for all model sets using the ecospat.boyce function of the ecospat package in R. Here a graph of predicted versus expected for a good model should show a monotonically increasing curve [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and the correlation between P/E and habitat suitability should be positive if model predictions are consistent with the distribution of presences in the independent validation dataset [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>Not only does this independent data test the validity of the models, but also the assumption of stationarity that cannot be tested through cross validation. That is to say, the assumption that any relationships derived from the observed data hold true and are consistent for areas/periods beyond the range of observed data. This assumption is crucial if derived models are to be used for any early warning system.</p><p>The validation was first conducted using all the 2018 to 2019 season case locations (n = 84 cells at a 1 km resolution, n = 68 cells at a 2 km resolution). Then, to test whether the models could predict new geographic foci of human cases, we conducted the validation separately and compared results for: (i) locations from the newly affected sub-district of Sagara (61% of 2018 to 2019 season case locations, spanning 37 cells at a 1 km resolution and 25 cells at a 2 km resolution); and (ii) locations from the sub-district of Tirthahalli (36% of 2018 to 2019 season case locations, spanning 40 cells at a 1 km resolution and 36 cells at a 2 km resolution), which recorded 95% of the past cases used to parameterise the model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec008"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Environmental predictors of the recent past distribution of Kyasanur Forest Disease</title><p>Models combining topography, landscape metrics, hosts, and public health predictors predicted recent patterns in KFD with a high degree of accuracy.

Human cases of Kyasanur Forest Disease tend to be highly localized, with epidemics lasting three to five years in a particular 30-40km<sup>2</sup> area, in which the disease shifts each season to affect a new handful of villages[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As seen in other tick-borne diseases[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], such highly focal patterns in human epidemics results from the interplay of environmental and ecological dynamics underpinning hazard and the human activities that govern exposure across the landscape [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Our models indicated that focal patterns in human KFD cases can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy from combined metrics of area and diversity of different forest types, plantation and cattle, as well as elevation. Overall, landscapes that were at high risk of occurrence of human KFD cases were characterised by diverse forest-plantation mosaics, containing large amounts of moist evergreen forest and plantation and low amounts of dry deciduous forests, with high indigenous cattle densities, occurring at elevations over 650 m a.s.l. These findings are consistent with prior suggestions that KFD is an "ecotonal" disease[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and that creation of such habitat mosaics, when forest is removed for paddy cultivation and plantations, precipitates emergence of KFD in humans [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The models presented here quantify and map &#x0201c;risky&#x0201d; habitat explicitly.</p><p>The models predicted human case locations with high accuracy in the sub-district from which the input data from the prior four years had been drawn. They also predicted large clusters of human cases in the newly affected sub-district over 30 km away. Their failure to predict some isolated case locations in the newly affected area, suggests that the models, parameterised with four years data from an epidemic in one sub-district, may be under-estimating the &#x0201c;environmental niche&#x0201d; of human spill-over of KFD cases to some degree. Ideally, such correlative, pattern-matching models should be updated annually, preferably prior to the transmission season, as cases arise in new areas.</p><p>Currently, KFD management activities of vaccination, surveillance and awareness raising are conducted within a 5 km to 10 km radius of prior known cases (from the past 4 years). Given that vaccine resources are often constrained during the outbreak season and the uncertainty in our model predictions (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008179.g005">Fig 5</xref>), we would not recommend that Health Departments rely on the resulting maps for spatial targeting of vaccine doses. Instead, pre-season tick surveillance activities of the Health Department and awareness raising in Primary Health Centres (early diagnosis of KFD) could be targeted towards areas of high relative predicted suitability of KFD that fall outside the 5 km radius of known cases. Thus would increase the likelihood that new foci of transmission are detected rapidly before or very early in the season, triggering rapid responses including vaccination.</p><p>Since model accuracy did not increase substantially when the area of forest loss was added to the models, this may indicate that the composition of forest and plantation types in the diverse mosaic around a settlement is of greater importance in determining KFD risk than a particular level of deforestation per se. This concurs with our a priori expectations that human contact rates across landscapes of different composition will depend on how human activities and the dynamics and infection rates of key vectors, wildlife and domestic reservoirs are linked to different types of forest and cultivation. However, accurate quantification of the level of forest loss that can lead to emergence of KFD in humans was hampered by the poor correspondence between global spatial data on forest loss and gain [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and the local patterns in forest types shown on the Land Use Land Cover map. The strong correlation between areas of forest gain and areas of forest loss in the global dataset for our study area suggests that the forest loss metric is more of an indicator of &#x02018;intensification&#x02019;, where forest is converted into plantation, rather than permanently lost (to make way for crops or built up areas). Local-scale understanding of these loss and intensification processes can be improved through time series analysis of Landsat Imagery (currently underway in the MonkeyFeverRisk project).</p><p>The finding that human cases of KFD are more likely to occur in landscapes with greater coverage of plantations is consistent with suggestions that large KFD epidemics in the 1970s and 1980s were linked to international development projects that replaced evergreen forest with cashew plantations [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is also consistent with observations that migrant agricultural labourers in plantations have been widely affected in recent epidemics in Maharashtra and Goa States [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. There are numerous potential explanations for the finding that human cases or KFD are more likely in landscapes with higher cattle densities. Cattle are thought to amplify local densities of ticks and bring ticks into households (either directly or through dry leaves used as fodder) whilst cattle grazing may bring small-holders into contact with tick habitat in forests, paddies and plantation.</p><p>Since our models are developed with disease data at household level, and scaled to the daily movement of local communities of 1&#x02013;2 km through the landscape, impacts of micro-scale factors such as small water-bodies (&#x0003c;10 km) on disease patterns may not be detectable. Obtaining finer scale data on how locations of exposure to relate to such micro-scale factors is difficult because people are often unable to pinpoint where on their daily routes infected ticks were picked up and close monitoring of burdens by researchers may hamper livelihood activities.</p><p>The socio-ecological mechanisms linking human cases of KFD and landscape factors can be understood only through joint study across fragmented forest landscapes of the intersecting (1) human activities and priorities of forest users that underpin exposure and (2) vector and host population dynamics and infection rates that underpin hazard. Such empirical, inter-disciplinary, landscape scale studies for KFD are currently underway within the MonkeyFeverRisk project.</p><p>Prior studies have already highlighted several advantages of combining participatory methods and traditional models for understanding and predicting zoonotic diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These include an improved understanding of contextual risk factors (including social, cultural, political and economic dimensions), both by corroborating a priori knowledge and highlighting hitherto unknown factors, and allowing models to be parameterised with realistic data at field level rather than with aggregated data (that is more often available from Public and Animal Health Systems). Here we highlight the (additional) benefits from linking participatory methods and models within a co-production process. Firstly, throughout the framing and knowledge integration stages, cross-sectoral stakeholders contribute valuable hypotheses about key risk factors and the policy landscape for zoonotic diseases that may have been over-looked in the scientific literature and can be tested within models (<xref rid="pntd.0008179.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, a key next step is to integrate remote sensing of seasonal dynamics of rice paddies into the MonkeyFeverRisk predictive model framework and field surveys since local disease managers highlighted these landscape features (and harvest time) as key potential nodes of interaction between people, wildlife hosts and tick vectors for KFD. Several risk factors highlighted by stakeholders, including poor data management, low vaccine uptake and under-reporting of monkey deaths, could not be integrated into models, either because they are not measured or because they are poorly linked to available geographical proxies. Awareness of these risk factors still informs treatment of input data, interpretation of model outputs and priorities and partnerships for future collection of both health and environmental data. For example, spatial information on vaccine coverage is now being collected by Primary Health Centres and shared with District Health Officials whilst the Indian Government National Biodiversity Mission aims to address some gaps in data on alternative hosts and vectors for priority zoonotic diseases.</p><p>A second advantage of co-production in this context is that the spatial grain of models for zoonotic diseases was tailored to the scale at which forests are used, and to the size and distance between settlements, that govern how forest communities access health services and report cases of KFD. Thus co-production helped to bridge the traditional gap between the scale of model outputs and the scale of intervention and ecosystem use [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and enabled finer scale relationships to be established between the environment and human disease cases (household-level). Many predictive models in the scientific literature that map geographical patterns in infectious diseases draw data from online databases such as ProMed and HealthMap which can often record only the locations of hospital or Primary health centres where cases are reported [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. By working with disease managers to collate and interpret case data, it becomes clear that visits to health centres can occur far away from the settlements or forest habitat in which infection is acquired (e.g. for KFD may range from 5&#x02013;10 km for small-holders but some 10s of km for tourists, students travelling between home and college, pilgrims and migrant labourers). If hospital or health centre data are used indiscriminately to parameterise disease-environment relationships, the resulting associations and predictive maps could be spurious and unsuitable for spatial targeting of interventions. Though these data drawbacks have long been noted for tick-borne diseases[<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], probably due to the time required to collate fine scale data and engage with local disease managers, predictive maps are still being developed based solely on health centre locations and advocated as disease management tools, including for KFD [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. We concur with Boden and McKendrick [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], who argued that all models supplied to health policy makers should adhere strictly to the principles of independence, transparency (autonomy), beneficence and justice. It is incumbent on disease modellers to appraise and be transparent about the suitability of available case data for relating and predicting infection processes from environmental conditions. The iterative, reflexive engagement with stakeholders&#x02019; needs and knowledge, through a co-production process, can facilitate this transparency.</p><p>Finally, working directly with disease managers to interpret and validate model outputs means that the scale, appearance and explanation of resulting maps and guidance can be better tailored to their needs, increasingly the likelihood of uptake for spatial targeting of interventions. For example, cross-sectoral stakeholders in the MonkeyFeverRisk project indicated that predictive maps at scales from village level up to clusters of villages, with contextual landscape features like roads and household locations, would be most helpful for planning of vaccination, surveillance and awareness campaigns [<xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As a consequence, preliminary risk layers that could be visualised within Google Earth were supplied to the Shivamogga Health Department for validation and experimentation.</p><p>Our approach of using co-production to guide production of risk maps that integrate hazard and exposure factors influencing human disease, harnessing a broad range of stakeholder knowledge and expertise across sectors, represents an important step forward in managing zoonotic disease in LMICs. This approach is applicable across wide ranging individual and interacting zoonotic diseases affecting dependent communities in different ecosystems. It will be imperative to develop context-dependent co-production processes that account for the cultural and political dimensions that affect exposure through ecosystem use, alongside local environmental and ecological factors that determine hazard, and underpin success of inter-sectoral One Health collaboration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008179.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>The distribution of pairwise distances between records of human cases of Kyasanur Forest Disease (2014&#x02013;2018).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008179.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008179.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Scale of daily movements of people from their households into the forest for livelihood activities in a KFD-affected district.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008179.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008179.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Participatory methods to identify with cross-sectoral stakeholders the key risk factors for Kyasanur Forest Disease and key policies affecting transmission and management.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008179.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008179.s004"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Environmental predictors of Kyasanur Forest Disease distribution.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008179.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008179.s005"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Deriving the Land Use Land Cover map of Shivamogga from Earth observation data.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008179.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008179.s006"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Marginal response plots for key predictors of presence of human cases of Kyasanur Forest Disease.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008179.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008179.s007"><label>S6 File</label><caption><title>Test for spatial autocorrelation in residuals of Boosted Regression Tree models of Kyasanur Forest Disease.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008179.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008179.s008"><label>S7 File</label><caption><title>Maps of predicted probability of presence of KFD from different sets of BRT models.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008179.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008179.s009"><label>S8 File</label><caption><title>External validation of the risk maps using 2018/2019 outbreak data and the Boyce Index.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008179.s009.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>DHFWS thanks the National Institute of Virology, Pune and the Manipal Centre for Virus Research for supporting them in the diagnostics of KFD for outbreak management.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0008179.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Mapping of poverty and likely zoonoses hotspots [Internet].

The data used are clearly described and the description of modelling analyses are well written.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Authors have analyzed the geo-spatial risk factors of an important zoonotic disease using a co-production approach. It has a potential to be of predictive value for focusing public health resources of surveillance for other zoonoses also. </p><p>Methods used are mostly appropriate.</p><p>In the methods section the use of software such as 'R software' and other geo-spatial software should be explicitly mentioned in a separate paragraph.</p><p>lines 215-220 and 237-248 (human KFD case data):</p><p>The exact method used for geo-referencing for the cases of 2018-19 should be mentioned. Whether this involved GIS based geo-coordinate data for each patient or assigning locations based on google-earth/google-map platform after making a filed visit should be specified. The method has been outlined for earlier transmission season. It may be noted that the GIS based method during the field visit (using GIS enabled instruments or even smartphone) is more accurate.</p><p>The reason for not using a more accurate GIS-based geo-location strategy for the cases (especially for the recent transmission season) should be mentioned. Even for the past cases, GIS based geo-coordinates may be obtained by conducting household visits with the help of the frontline health workers.</p><p>The impact of accuracy of this key input data on the overall analysis and conclusions should be mentioned in the limitations section (which needs to be added by the authors). This is especially important since the authors themselves discuss the importance of micro-scale level features such as waterbodies in the range of 10 sq metre and the limitations of Landsat image at 30 m scale (lines 304-308)'</p><p>Reviewer #3: This manuscript describes the results of a study of risk factors for Kyasanur Forest Disease in the western Ghats of India. The authors identified potential risk factors to assess in models by involving stakeholders, who also participated in identifying the relevant scales for spatial analyses. The analyses identify several risk factors that are correlated with earlier outbreaks. The authors then identify future outbreak areas and compare these to an outbreak in 2018/19, concluding that the model accurately predicted the location of this outbreak.</p><p>This is an interesting study and the authors are investigating a neglected disease that is a major human health issue. The inclusion of stakeholders is a useful model for conducting an investigation of this type, and the partnership appears to have been a fruitful collaboration among investigators from different areas of research. </p><p>My major concern with this study is that the authors do not take a critical enough look at their own data, at least based on the general presentation in the manuscript. For example, in several places, they note that the 2018/19 outbreak locations were entirely in zones of high risk, as predicted by their model. This is clearly not the case. Though some of the case locations are within high risk zones, others are in lower risk zones. Further, they indicate, e.g. in the abstract, that they correctly identified a hotspot of an outbreak before it occurred. However, in the region of Sagara taluk depicted in Figure 6, roughly 1/3 of the entire area is identified by the model as high risk, and the outbreak occurred in just one of the many locations they predicted as hotspots. It&#x02019;s great news that there weren&#x02019;t more outbreaks, but the authors do need to wrestle with the fact that their risk maps indicated a lot of hotspots, and approximately one of the many regions they identified actually had an outbreak. How should a resource-poor region deal with predictions like these? Would delivering vaccinations over such a large area strain resources? Might it be possible to refine their models with more/better data so that they could provide more accurate outbreak locations? Is this good enough to be useful? Is it good enough to avoid being counter-productive, e.g. by diffusing a public health response that could have been more focused with better data? Again, the larger concern here is that the authors risk coming across as advocating a particular approach rather than objectively evaluating its strengths and weaknesses. This is particularly problematic because their approach is not an unequivocal success. </p><p>In another vein, the authors don&#x02019;t address their inability to develop quantifiable indices for some of the variables identified as important by their stakeholders, e.g. Table 1, nor the fairly coarse fit between their spatial proxies for some of the variables and the identified risk factors. This is a major issue, and should be addressed in the Methods and in the Discussion, particularly in light of their discussion of the advantages of co-production. One of the challenges is that (appropriate) data might not be available. What issues does this raise? What kinds of partnerships could arise from such a discussion, i.e. to collect or gather some of the missing data? Would it be better to wait to run the models until those data can be obtained so that they more accurately reflect actual risk? </p><p>I appreciate the clear explanation of both the need for and the response to spatial clustering of the case presence data, and the supplementary file that provides some additional information. Their conclusion is that there is still mild spatial autocorrelation, based on Moran&#x02019;s I, but they conclude that it is not important despite its presence in fairly large percentages of their model runs. By what objective grounds do they determine that spatial autocorrelation is not a problem for their analysis? Also, it would be helpful for them to include the sample sizes of case sites after thinning.</p><p>The authors analyze their data with and without the incorporation of the variable for forest loss. They do not investigate the model with and without any other variables, nor do they rigorously evaluate the potential intercorrelation of their variables. These are important considerations and need to be addressed in the manuscript. In partcular, discussion topics like those on lines 621 and on, in which they interpret what they see as a lack of importance of forest loss as a predictor, are problematic. </p><p>The authors mention in several places (e.g. line 570) in the manuscript that &#x0201c;When the model</p><p>predictions are overlaid with the outbreak locations in Sagarataluk in Fig. 6 (black locations),</p><p>it can be seen that all of these locations occur in orange to red areas of high predicted</p><p>probability of presence (except the south-eastern most isolated location which has a low</p><p>probability of presence in 2km models).&#x0201d; But this is clearly not the case in any of the maps presented. This undermines this reviewer&#x02019;s confidence in the objectivity of their analysis.</p><p>--------------------</p><p><bold>Results</bold></p><p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p><p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p><p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p><p>Reviewer #1: The analysis presented corresponds to the plan presented in the methods and results are clearly presented. In the general comments I make one suggestion with respect to showing the predictive maps without human case locations so that map underneath can be seen - suggest placing in a 4th plot.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p><p>Certain suggestions are as follows</p><p>Table 1 - row 8, column 4 - there is overlapping of text with the cell immediately below it. This needs to be corrected. Are the spatial proxies of 'low vaccination coverage' and 'poor diagnosis and surveillance' the same ?</p><p>Table 2 - the category of predictor can be clubbed and written once instead of repeating it</p><p>Table 4 - there is overlap between the last two columns. This needs to be correctly presented.</p><p>Reviewer #3: The manuscript would be improved by a thorough edit, e.g. line 86. </p><p>Line 374 &#x02013; Here, the methods indicate that the models are parameterised with presence-only data, though previously absence data were described. Please make a clearer distinction between when presence-only and presence/absence data were used to develop models. </p><p>Line 275 &#x02013; &#x0201c;Forest diversity&#x0201d; is not the ideal descriptor for the variable used here. Based on the description, they seem to have used &#x0201c;Diversity of forest types&#x0201d;, while &#x0201c;forest diversity&#x0201d; sounds like they quantified the species diversity within forests, which they didn&#x02019;t. I would suggest changing this throughout. </p><p>Line 621 &#x02013; The authors discuss why incorporating forest loss did not substantially improve model accuracy. Their explanations do not incorporate a reason for why forest loss emerged as the second most important factor when it was incorporated. One possibility is that forest loss is correlated with another one of their variables, and I do not see where they rule out this possibility. </p><p>Line 711 &#x02013; Please spell out acronyms.</p><p>Figure 2. Why not replace the cryptic panel headings (e.g. Area_ME) that require a special sentence in the legend with informative headings right in the figure? (e.g. &#x0201c;Area of moist evergreen forest&#x0201d;).</p><p>Figure 6, line 981 &#x02013; The authors claim that &#x0201c;The black outbreak locations occur in areas of high probability of presence (orange to red) in all models.&#x0201d; This statement is not actually consistent with the data presented in Figure 6, in which quite a number of the black dots occur in blue or white cells. </p><p>For all figures with scales, more information about the scale values needs to be included.</p><p>--------------------</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p><p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p><p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p><p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p><p>Reviewer #1: The discussion is well written, public health relevance is addressed and there is discussion on how the analyses presented can advance understanding of KFD distribution in addition to wider application of the methods used.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Conclusions (as mentioned in the discussion section) are supported by the data presented.</p><p>However, a brief conclusion section should be added after the discussion.</p><p>The limitations of the study have not been described and need to be discussed.</p><p>The relevance of the study has been discussed.</p><p>Reviewer #3: Overall, this is a potentially useful approach to modeling risk factors for an important disease, and the manuscript has many strengths.

The choice of risk factors for inclusion in models was based on information gained from a workshop with key stakeholders. Machine learning algorithms were used to fit models to human case data. Resulting models were then tested for the ability to identify areas where a new outbreak had occurred, not used for initial model fitting. The modelling identified diverse forest-plantation mosaics with high proportion of moist evergreen forest, high cattle density and elevation above 650m as important risk factors for KFD.</p><p>Overall, I think that the manuscript is of publishable quality and suitable for PLoS NTDs. In particular, the combined use of: i) information from key stakeholders to guide modelling and; ii) case data from a new area to validate models is novel with respect to zoonotic diseases relevant to developing countries. I do not have any major concerns with respect to the scientific approach and conclusions made but highlight that my skills and experience are not sufficient to comment in detail on the modelling techniques used.</p><p>The manuscript overall is well structured and well written. I only really therefore have three suggestions:</p><p>The manuscript could be shortened substantially, in particular the introduction. I would suggest cutting the text on lines 117 &#x02013; 126 about &#x02018;co-production&#x02019; and then lines 164 &#x02013; 187 and instead replace with concise aims of the project which I interpret to be: i) identification of risk factors to include in models through stakeholder engagement; ii) development of predictive models; iii) validation of models. I do think the text/ framing around &#x02018;co-production&#x02019; over complicates the paper and instead reference to &#x02018;one-health&#x02019; approaches would suffice and simplify. </p><p>In relation to the above, suggest changing the title to be explicit about what was done and what the study found. Perhaps something along the lines of &#x02018;Spatial models developed through stakeholder engagement predict high risk areas of KFD in India&#x02019;.</p><p>For figures showing predictive maps and human case locations perhaps have open circles or show cases separately on a 4th panel so that the map beneath can be seen clearly.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Article is well-written overall. However certain portions in the results section needs to be shortened to avoid repetition with data presented in figures and tables. Longer sentences may be may be reframed into shorter sentences.</p><p>Unnecessary use of brackets (such as 349, 382 ) may be avoided to maintain the flow of the sentence.</p><p>Reviewer #3: (No Response)</p><p>--------------------</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">what does this mean?</ext-link>).
