<p>The manuscript could be shortened substantially, in particular the introduction. I would suggest cutting the text on lines 117 – 126 about ‘co-production’ and then lines 164 – 187 and instead replace with concise aims of the project which I interpret to be: i) identification of risk factors to include in models through stakeholder engagement; ii) development of predictive models; iii) validation of models. I do think the text/ framing around ‘co-production’ over complicates the paper and instead reference to ‘one-health’ approaches would suffice and simplify. </p>
