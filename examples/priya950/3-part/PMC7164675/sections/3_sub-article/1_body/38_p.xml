<p>The exact method used for geo-referencing for the cases of 2018-19 should be mentioned. Whether this involved GIS based geo-coordinate data for each patient or assigning locations based on google-earth/google-map platform after making a filed visit should be specified. The method has been outlined for earlier transmission season. It may be noted that the GIS based method during the field visit (using GIS enabled instruments or even smartphone) is more accurate.</p>
