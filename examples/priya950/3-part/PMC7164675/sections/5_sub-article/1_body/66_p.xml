<p>Line 756-761 - The last sentence in discussion section appears to be an inordinately long sentence. Needs to be re-framed/ shortened. Similarly 688-692 and 676-680 are examples where the sentence used appears to be quite long. It appears to me that average sentence length is longer in this article than what would be needed for easy comprehension by readers.</p>
