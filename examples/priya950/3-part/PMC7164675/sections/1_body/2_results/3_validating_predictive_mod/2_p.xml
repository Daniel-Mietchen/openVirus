<p>Case locations in the newly affected Sagara taluka were less well captured by the models than case locations in the long-affected Tirthahalli taluka. Boyce Index values exceeded 0.8 for most model sets but were consistently lower for the Sagara data than the Tirthahalli data, (

The 2 km models excluding forest loss were most consistent with the distributions of the presences in the Sagara data. Though the major foci of human cases in central Sagara were captured by model predictions, several isolated case locations in the north, east and west occurred in grid cells predicted to have a low probability of presence of KFD (
