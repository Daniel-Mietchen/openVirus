<p>There was considerable variation in the rank importance of variables across model runs for all model sets (see rank columns in Tables 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.t006" ref-type="table">6</xref>) which is to be expected given the low sample size that results from the geographical thinning. In all model sets, the public health predictors (proximity to health centres, number of medics per head of population) and human population size had consistently low importance.
