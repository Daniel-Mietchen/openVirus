<p>In tests for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals, significant but low magnitude (Moranâ€™s I &lt; = 0.2) was found at distances between 1 and 15 km but this was not consistent across model runs. Inference from the BRT models is more robust to small spatial correlation due to the flexibility of the modelling approach, the robustness to outliers and the use of importance metrics rather than significance testing. Therefore we expected this remaining small spatial autocorrelation to have a negligible impact on the above inferred role of environmental predictors and estimates of model accuracy (
