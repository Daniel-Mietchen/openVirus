<p>The response plots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008179.g004">Fig 4</xref> indicate that KFD outbreaks are more likely to occur when the proportional area of moist evergreen forest is intermediate or high (&gt;15% of the area), when the proportion of dry deciduous forest is low (&lt;10% of the area), when the amount of forest loss pixels is higher (&gt; 10% of the area), when indigenous cattle densities are higher, when forest diversity is higher (&gt;1.0) and the proportional area of plantation is higher. Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008179.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008179.g003">3</xref> illustrate how the cases between 2014 and 2018 were indeed concentrated in 1 km squares with a diverse mosaic of forest types, namely moist evergreen and plantation that are likely to have undergone rapid change. Once area of forest loss was added to the model, it ranked second in importance to the area of moist evergreen forest but the subsequent order of importance of the other landscape predictors listed above remained the same as for models without forest loss (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, right hand columns). The addition of area of forest loss to the models at 1 km does not increase the accuracy in cross-validation over models without area of forest loss.
