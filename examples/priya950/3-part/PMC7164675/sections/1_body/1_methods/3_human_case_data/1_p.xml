<p>Human cases of Kyasanur Forest Disease occur seasonally between December and May when the abundance of infected nymphal ticks in the forest is at a peak. Designated laboratories for processing human samples of KFD from Shivamogga District include the Virus Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL), Shivamogga, the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune and Manipal Centre for Virus Research. Human cases, arising from samples testing positive for Kyasanur Forest Disease by RT-PCR or IgM ELISA in either laboratory in the five years between the December 2013 / May 2014 and December 2017 / May 2018 outbreak seasons, were compiled by co-author, Dr S. K. Kiran, who served as Taluka Medical Officer for Tirthahalli from 2010â€“2019. Cases were assigned to locations retrospectively using Google Earth, following personal visits to households of affected patients conducted by Dr Kiran, or Medical Officers in other talukas, during the outbreak seasons. These locations were marked on Google Earth to retrieve the geographical coordinates in Latitude and Longitude to an estimated spatial precision of around 300 m. Cases of febrile illness may be reported to Primary Health Centres and from home addresses that are very distant from where infection is acquired. For example, migrant agricultural labourers work in plantations and pilgrims visiting temples in forest areas that can be 10s to 100s of kilometres from their homes [

Based on case-tracing that Taluka Medical Officers had performed during the outbreak seasons, such cases (&lt; 10) could be excluded from the analysis. In total, 329 cases from 117 different household or village locations were compiled over the five transmission seasons (144 cases from 2013/2014, 32 from 2014/2015, 32 from 2015/2016, 89 from 2016/2017, 32 from 2017/2018). The presence and number of cases were summarised at a 1 km x 1 km and 2 km x 2 km grid resolution across Shivamogga, resulting in 65 (of a total of 7732) land cells and 53 (of a total of 1926) land cells positive for KFD respectively at these study grains. These two study grains were chosen to reflect the range of distances from households at which forest users may acquire infection from forest habitats during their livelihood activities. Interviews with members of similar forest communities in Wayanad, Kerala revealed that forest users move between 1 and 4 km through forest habitats from their homes during the main risk KFD period(January to March, see
