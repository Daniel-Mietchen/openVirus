<p>Not only does this independent data test the validity of the models, but also the assumption of stationarity that cannot be tested through cross validation. That is to say, the assumption that any relationships derived from the observed data hold true and are consistent for areas/periods beyond the range of observed data. This assumption is crucial if derived models are to be used for any early warning system.</p>
