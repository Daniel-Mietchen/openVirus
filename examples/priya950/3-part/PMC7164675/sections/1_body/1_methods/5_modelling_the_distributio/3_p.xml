<p>Absence data: Since Boosted Regression Trees require both presence and absence data, the presences were matched with an equal number of selected absence grid cells as recommended by Barbet-Massin et al.[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] for BRTs. When selecting absence data, it is important to try to mimic the recording process that gives rise to the presence data. For example, human cases of KFD tend to be reported from rural land areas and communities. Therefore very large water bodies and built-up areas like towns and cities were excluded from the absence selection process by including only 1 km or 2 km grid cells encompassed by the census village boundaries in the selection area. Cells containing presences were also removed from the selection area at each resolution. We then randomly selected 30 absence cells at each resolution, each of which occurred in a different 5 km grid cell, and this process was repeated 100 times to generate 100 absence datasets. Each presence dataset was combined with one of the absence datasets to generate 100 presence-absence datasets at each resolution.
