<p>The validation was first conducted using all the 2018 to 2019 season case locations (n = 84 cells at a 1 km resolution, n = 68 cells at a 2 km resolution). Then, to test whether the models could predict new geographic foci of human cases, we conducted the validation separately and compared results for: (i) locations from the newly affected sub-district of Sagara (61% of 2018 to 2019 season case locations, spanning 37 cells at a 1 km resolution and 25 cells at a 2 km resolution); and (ii) locations from the sub-district of Tirthahalli (36% of 2018 to 2019 season case locations, spanning 40 cells at a 1 km resolution and 36 cells at a 2 km resolution), which recorded 95% of the past cases used to parameterise the model.</p>
