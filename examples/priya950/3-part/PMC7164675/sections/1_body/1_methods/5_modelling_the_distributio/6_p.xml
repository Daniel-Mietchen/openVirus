<p>The direction of the association between human cases of KFD and particular predictor variables was evaluated from the response curves produced from the BRT model. The response curves for a predictor were averaged across the 100 BRT sub-models by calculating mean and standard deviation of the marginal predicted probabilities within ~40 bins of the predictor values.</p>
