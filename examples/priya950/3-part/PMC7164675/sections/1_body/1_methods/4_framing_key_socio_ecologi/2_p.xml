<p>Forest loss and degradation was the highest ranked environmental risk factor for KFD by stakeholders, consistent with scientific literature linking forest loss and creation of mosaic forest-paddy-scrub village habitat to human emergence events [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Stakeholders considered that abrupt shifts in land use between forest and village areas made communities more vulnerable to KFD. Metrics of forest change considered in the analysis were area of forest loss and gain since 2000 per grid cell derived from Hansen et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Area of forest gain was highly collinear with area of forest loss (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r = 0.968), and much less prevalent (making up 0.16% versus 1.2% of 30m land pixels), so was excluded from the analysis. To quantify mosaic habitat, the amount and diversity of different forest types, of agricultural or fallow land and plantation and overall land use diversity were extracted from the MonkeyFeverRisk Land Use Land Cover map (LULC map), derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery (2016–2017) as detailed in

Edge metrics for forest types were also calculated as a measure of the amount of interface habitat between forest, agriculture and villages but were highly collinear with amount of individual forest types and so were not included in the final analysis (
