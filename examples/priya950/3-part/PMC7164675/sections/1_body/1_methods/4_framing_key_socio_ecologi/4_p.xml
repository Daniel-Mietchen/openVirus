<p>Again consistent with literature [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], diverse public health factors were ranked by stakeholders as key risk factors for KFD (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) such as lack of awareness of KFD and preventative measures, low acceptance and coverage of vaccination, poor diagnostics and surveillance including under-reporting of human cases or monkey deaths. Available spatial proxies of access to health services and education and surveillance effort, developed from Indian Government census data (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s004">S3 File</xref>), were the proximity to a primary health centre, overall human population size and the number of medics available per head of population at village level (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s004">S3 File</xref>). Some risk factors like poor data management, low vaccine uptake and under-reporting of monkey deaths by the Forest Department, will be less well linked to such spatial proxies.
