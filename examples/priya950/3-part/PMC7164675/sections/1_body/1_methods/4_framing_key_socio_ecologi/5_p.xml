<p>Consistent with literature linking tick demography and host-seeking behaviour to micro-climatic factors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], stakeholders also mentioned suitable micro-climates for tick populations among key risk factors for KFD (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, available gridded weather station data is too coarse in resolution to define spatial variation in climate at village to district levels. Topographical factors, namely slope and elevation, and associated vegetation types from the LULC map were considered to be better proxies of micro-climatic conditions at village and district scale. Small water bodies of around 10m
 <sup>2</sup> were hypothesised by disease managers to be key locations in the landscape where monkeys carrying KFD, nymphal ticks and grazing animals might co-occur. Conversely, large water-bodies could constitute barriers to dispersal of wildlife hosts for tick vectors and KFD, and in turn, to epidemic spread [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The LULC map is based on 30 m resolution Landsat data, thus only detects water-bodies of larger than 30m. Thus, the coverage of such larger water-bodies per grid cell was included a priori amongst predictors, with the expectation that high coverage of such water-bodies would be unfavourable for KFD.
