<p>Our approach of using co-production to guide production of risk maps that integrate hazard and exposure factors influencing human disease, harnessing a broad range of stakeholder knowledge and expertise across sectors, represents an important step forward in managing zoonotic disease in LMICs. This approach is applicable across wide ranging individual and interacting zoonotic diseases affecting dependent communities in different ecosystems. It will be imperative to develop context-dependent co-production processes that account for the cultural and political dimensions that affect exposure through ecosystem use, alongside local environmental and ecological factors that determine hazard, and underpin success of inter-sectoral One Health collaboration.</p>
