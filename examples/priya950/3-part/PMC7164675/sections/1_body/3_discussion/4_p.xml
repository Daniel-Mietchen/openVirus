<p>Currently, KFD management activities of vaccination, surveillance and awareness raising are conducted within a 5 km to 10 km radius of prior known cases (from the past 4 years). Given that vaccine resources are often constrained during the outbreak season and the uncertainty in our model predictions (depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008179.g005">Fig 5</xref>), we would not recommend that Health Departments rely on the resulting maps for spatial targeting of vaccine doses. Instead, pre-season tick surveillance activities of the Health Department and awareness raising in Primary Health Centres (early diagnosis of KFD) could be targeted towards areas of high relative predicted suitability of KFD that fall outside the 5 km radius of known cases. Thus would increase the likelihood that new foci of transmission are detected rapidly before or very early in the season, triggering rapid responses including vaccination.
