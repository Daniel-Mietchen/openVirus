<p>This study advances understanding of the landscape determinants of human cases of a zoonotic disease by considering wide-ranging topographical, host, land use factors and public health constraints. Human cases of Kyasanur Forest Disease tend to be highly localized, with epidemics lasting three to five years in a particular 30-40km
 <sup>2</sup> area, in which the disease shifts each season to affect a new handful of villages[

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], such highly focal patterns in human epidemics results from the interplay of environmental and ecological dynamics underpinning hazard and the human activities that govern exposure across the landscape [
