<p>This paper describes the co-production–with actors and beneficiaries across the public health, animal health and forestry sectors–of the landscape-level spatial models and understanding of risk factors for a case study zoonotic disease, Kyasanur Forest Disease. The model is developed for Shivamogga district in Karnataka, which has been affected by KFD since the 1950s, and reports a high proportion of India’s human cases (e.g. 656 or 34% of 1929 cases reported between 2010 and 2019). Because of this, health managers of this district have long experience in disease surveillance and control. Using point locations for human cases recorded at sub-village level by health managers between 2014 and 2018, spatial Boosted Regression Tree models [
