<p>Integrating land use patterns, ecosystem and social factors into interpretations of past disease patterns at a range of geographical scales [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] can indicate potential mechanisms and facilitate prediction of disease risk across new landscapes or for the same landscapes under future alternative environmental and development policies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Conceptual frameworks, like the global “One Health” paradigm, recognise the interconnectedness of human health, wildlife and domestic animal health and the environment[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite this, models of zoonotic disease risk in tropical regions have often focussed on a single set of processes that drive variability in disease risk and effectiveness of interventions ([
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but see [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). For example, published risk maps and spatial decision support tools for tick-borne zoonoses tend to focus on mapping environmental hazard (or presumed correlates of environmental hazard like tick abundance or presence[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]), but often do not integrate the social factors which drive patterns in exposure [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Tools and maps are rarely linked to intervention programs at a scale appropriate to sources of epidemics[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and ecosystem use. Leach &amp; Scoones [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] recommend instead that disciplines, data and models are not only integrated, but “triangulated” with deliberation around framing assumptions, policy narrative, politics and values. The process of co-production is ideally suited to the development of models to understand and predict zoonotic diseases. Co-production is based on the need to integrate different forms of knowledge into decision-making. It involves active engagement of stakeholders from different sectors and scales as knowledge holders and future model users through three key stages of framing the problem, knowledge integration and experimentation [
