 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], accounting for around 26% of Disability-adjusted Life Years lost to infectious diseases in Lower Middle Income Countries (LMICs). Communities affected by zoonoses often depend on surrounding ecosystems for livelihoods and food security. In India, for example, around 300 million people depend directly on degraded forest ecosystems for food, fuel, livestock fodder and other non-timber forest products (NTFPs)[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A key cost of altering forest structure and accessing forest goods and services is the increased exposure of humans and livestock to multi-host zoonotic pathogens [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Forest habitats and their ecotones are a significant source of emerging and re-emerging infections because they support complex ecological communities, including high wildlife host and vector diversity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Upsurges in incidence of several high burden zoonotic diseases have been linked to deforestation or reforestation in LMICs (e.g. malaria[

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Forest communities are rendered even more vulnerable by their remoteness from healthcare infrastructure [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Disentangling the ecological and social mechanisms by which changes in forest habitat can precipitate impacts of multi-host pathogens is critical for the design of effective intervention strategies.
