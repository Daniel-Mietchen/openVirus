Human serological evidence indicates wide KFDV circulation in other states across India (Gujarat, West Bengal, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands) and on the border with China. Therefore, the landscape conditions favouring KFDV transmission are widespread [

KFD impacts are managed currently through vaccination, awareness campaigns and promotion of tick protection measures in and around recently affected areas. However, constraints on availability and efficacy of the vaccine, and reluctance of local communities to be vaccinated and adopt personal protection measures can exacerbate epidemics [
