<p>13) I'm worried about your decision to limit articles to those including both Zika and United States - Do you really think all relevant articles will include the term "United States"? For example,- people interested in the Rio olympics in Brazil will look at articles that do not use the term US. Also - you assume that only articles that explicitly connect the disease to the States will have an impact, which might not be the case. Anyway - I would remove the US condition from your search and look at all US media mentions of Zika. But if you decide to stick with your decision, at least explain why you did so in the discussion section and how it affects your conclusions.</p>
