<p>R1 and R3 raise several questions about the inclusion of articles in the study (and the possibility of duplicates). If it is possible to address these by looking at the sensitivity of the results to alternate inclusion criteria, this should be done. If this is not possible, then the authors should at least provide text that would answer to the reviewers' questions in the main text.</p>
