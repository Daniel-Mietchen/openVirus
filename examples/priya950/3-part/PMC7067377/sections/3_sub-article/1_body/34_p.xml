<p>On a related note, the other major limitation of the paper is the mismatch between theoretically longitudinal concerns with correlational data. Chances are good that time series analysis will tell us a similar story as the correlational analyses here but nonetheless because cases are ordered in time there is a risk that the analysis presented unfairly capitalizes on lurking autocorrelation in the data. The authors should comment on that and either present their findings using time series analysis or at least assure readers that such analysis provides a similar story in a detailed note.</p>
