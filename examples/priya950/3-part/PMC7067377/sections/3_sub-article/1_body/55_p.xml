<p>6) p5 - I'm very concerned with the use of Pearson correlation for variables that will definitely be influenced by autocorrelation. In such case, where I expect autoregression in both observed and unobserved variables that could be correlated with the dependent, I strongly prefer the use of vector auroregression models (VARS). VARS models could be coupled with Granger causality tests to support a causal direction as well.</p>
