<p>From an epidemiological standpoint, our results are consistent with the recent findings of Bragazzi et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], who analysed various data streams to measure the global reaction to the 2015-2016 ZIKV outbreaks in different countries. Similarly, we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the viewership of Wikipedia pages and the ZIKV incidence data in the U.S. The correlation between ZIKV incidence and media coverage was also mild, and varied from state to state, confirming that media coverage was only relatively influenced by the actual progression of the epidemic over time.
