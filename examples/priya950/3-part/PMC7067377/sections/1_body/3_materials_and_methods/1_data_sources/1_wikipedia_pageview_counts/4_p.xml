<p>Access to this nonpublic pageview data was granted from the Wikimedia Foundation under a non-disclosure agreement as part of its formal collaboration policy. For the analysis conducted in this study, we first selected the pageview counts that were localized in the United States only, from January 1, 2016 until December 31, 2016. We then aggregated all pageview counts for the 128 monitored Wikipedia pages at daily and weekly timescale.</p>
