<p>In our study, we collected all news items published online in 2016, which mentioned the words “Zika” and “United States”, through the Google Cloud Platform. More specifically we selected those items matching 
 <italic>TAX_DISEASE_ZIKA</italic> as a Theme and 
 <italic>United_States</italic> as a Location. Themes (
 <italic>V2Themes</italic>) and Locations (
 <italic>V2Locations</italic>) are automatically identified by the platform based on the textual content of the items and each item can be assigned multiple themes or locations. The complete query is provided in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007633.s001">S1 Appendix</xref> of the Supporting Information. The dataset contains a total of 112,706 news items from 7,737 different Web news outlets, in any of the 65 languages covered by the GDELT platform. News outlets are not necessarily based in the United States, the only constraint is that each news item mentions the United States. Time series analysed in our study report the number of news items citing Zika that appeared each day in 2016. Multiple mentions of the word “Zika” in the same article are not counted, therefore we consider the volume of individual articles mentioning Zika. Metadata associated to each news item allow to select only news mentioning a specific geographic entity beyond the United States, such as States or counties. Each item can be associated to multiple States, therefore in the State level analysis the same item can be counted in the time series of different States at the same time.
