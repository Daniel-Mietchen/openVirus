<p>To take into account the possibility of memory effects in the response to media exposure, we enrich the feature space of the regression model with additional features (time series) obtained by filtering the Web news and TV time series with an exponential memory kernel (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Methods</xref> for a complete description). The characteristic time 
 <italic>τ</italic> of the memory kernel, describing news persistence in the attention response, is a new hyper-parameter of the model to be set via cross-validation. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the performance of the model, in terms of determination coefficient 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>, Pearson’s 
 <italic>r</italic>, and Spearman’s 
 <italic>ρ</italic>, for 10 different sets of features. The introduction of a memory kernel increases the determination coefficient by about 20%, reaching an average 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.76. This is obtained for a characteristic time scale 
 <italic>τ</italic> of about 2 weeks, over which collective attention is affected by past media exposure.
