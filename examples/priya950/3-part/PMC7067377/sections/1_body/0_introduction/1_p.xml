<p>The advent of the digital era has radically changed the way individuals search for information and this is particularly relevant for health-related information [

The fruition of news sources, either traditional such as television, radio and newspapers, or digital such as Web news or online social networks, has become crucial in how health information is delivered and it can play a fundamental role in shaping opinions, awareness and behaviours.

However, modeling efforts have been mostly theoretical and a large-scale empirical characterization of the adoption of health protective behaviours, either induced by information spread or media exposure, and its interplay with the disease dynamics during an epidemic outbreak has been elusive so far due to the lack of available data [
