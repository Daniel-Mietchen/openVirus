<p>The communication challenges posed by ZIKV are well exemplified in a manual released in 2017 by the WHO European Region [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] on how to deal with the complex communication challenges of ZIKV and mosquito borne disease outbreaks in general. Among the main communication issues listed in the manual, besides 
 <italic>Dealing with uncertainty</italic> and 
 <italic>Rumor management</italic>, there are 
 <italic>Increase in information demand</italic> and 
 <italic>Managing evolving information</italic>. The last two are particularly interesting as they refer to the massive demand for information from the public, and from media as well, and to the necessity of adapting public health communication as more is learned about the outbreak and scientific knowledge about Zika virus and its complications evolve.
