<p>Our study analyses time-resolved and geo-localized Wikipedia pageview counts to investigate the dynamics of public attention in the United States, during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic. Accesses to Wikipedia pages represent a signal of information seeking behavior, defined as the deliberate process in which individuals actively aim to acquire new knowledge by searching for information on a specific topic [

Specifically, we considered the daily pageview counts on 128 different Zika-related Wikipedia articles (96 languages) in the U.S. to be an unambiguous indicator of collective attention to the epidemic. We investigated the temporal and spatial patterns of pageviews in relation to the timeline of ZIKV incidence reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and in relation to the coverage of the ZIKV epidemic by local and national media sources. In particular, we focused on news coverage of the ZIKV epidemic by online media and television in 2016, available in digital format through the GDELT project and the Internet Archive (see
