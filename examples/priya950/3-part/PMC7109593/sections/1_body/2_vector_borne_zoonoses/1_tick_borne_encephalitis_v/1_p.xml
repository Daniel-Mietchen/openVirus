<p>Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a tick-borne flavivirus widely distributed from Europe through far-eastern Russia to Japan. The virus is maintained in cycles involving

 <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ixodes persulcatus</italic>) and wild vertebrate hosts (mainly rodents)[

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by the detection of TBEV IgM and IgG antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Determination of IgG avidity may be helpful in cases of atypical antibody response[

Transmission of TBEV occurred through the transplanted organs (liver, kidneys) from a single donor to three recipients. The donor lived in an endemic area and the presence of TBEV was confirmed by the same viral strain detected in all recipients and in the donor[
