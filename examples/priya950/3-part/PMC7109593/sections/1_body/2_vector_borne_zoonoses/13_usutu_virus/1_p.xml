<p>Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that emerged in Europe in 1996[
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. The natural cycle, geographic distribution and clinical symptoms of USUV overlap with WNV. Although human clinical cases of USUV infection are rarely reported, several recently published reports highlight its role in the etiology of neuroinvasive diseases[

 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Like WNV, the majority of USUV infections are asymptomatic or present as a non-specific febrile disease (USUV fever)[

 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. In addition, some atypical presentations such as facial paresis have also described[

 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Since many of USUV cases remain underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as WNV due to similar clinical symptoms and serological cross-reactivity, clinicians should keep in mind this viral zoonosis, especially during the arbovirus transmission season.
