<p>Rickettsioses are bacterial infectious diseases that occur in endemic areas across the world. They are classified into two main groups: The spotted fever group with the main representatives; 
 <italic>Rickettsia rickettsii</italic> (Rocky Mountain spotted fever; RMSF) transmitted by the ticks in the USA, Mexico and South America[
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]; 
 <italic>R. conorii</italic> (Mediterranean spotted fever; MSF) transmitted by dog ticks in Southern and Eastern Europe, Africa, India, Russia[
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and the typhus group which includes 
 <italic>R. prowazekii</italic> (epidemic typhus) and 
 <italic>R. typhi</italic> (murine typhus
 <sup>)[48]</sup>. Following a tick exposure, clinically significant rickettsial infections present with flu-like symptoms with or without eschar at the site of the tick bite, accompanied by rash. The clinical course is highly variable and ranges from self-limited to vasculitis-mediated organ failure and death[
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The diagnosis of rickettsioses is most often established by serology. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) has been considered the gold standard. The test has limited utility in species determination within a serogroup due to extensive cross-reactivity and as any immunoglobulin-based assay in the context immunocom-promised patient should be interpreted with caution[
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Rickettsioses have been rarely reported in the transplant population. The scarcity of the data implies that even in immunocompromised hosts majority of the infections are mild and rarely result in a malignant vasculitis-associated form. A case of RMSF in a cardiac transplant recipient from southern Utah demonstrated a prompt clinical response after empirical treatment with doxycycline and delayed development of rickettsia antibodies (5 mo after the infection)[
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Only one case demonstrated the development of complications. Severe MSF infection has been reported in a kidney transplant recipient from Southern France, who developed flu-like symptoms, maculopapular rash and splenic rupture requiring splenectomy. Doxycycline therapy resulted in rapid improvement and favorable outcome[
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Rickettsial infections are probably underrecognized and underreported in the transplant population.
