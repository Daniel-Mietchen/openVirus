 <italic>Phlebotomus</italic> (in the Old World) or 
 <italic>Lutzomyia</italic> (in the New World). So far, at least 20 different 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> species have been associated with human infection. Clinical presentation of leishmaniasis includes cutaneous (CL), mucocutaneous (MCL), or visceral leishmaniasis (VL)[
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. CL occur in three different forms: Localized, diffuse and disseminated. CL is characterized by single or multiple skin ulcers, satellite lesions, or nodular lymphangitis. MCL present with mucosal tissue metastasis in the mouth and upper respiratory tract 
 <italic>via</italic> lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination. VL is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and if untreated it is fatal in 95% of patients[
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>,
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. VL is usually caused by 
 <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> or 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> although other 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> species that usually cause CL have been described causing VL too[
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Clinical presentation of VL is nonspecific with prolonged fever, anorexia, weight loss and overall poor health status. Typically the patients have hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy and in laboratory examination pancytopenia is frequently found[
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. The worldwide number of VL cases in SOT recipients has steadily increased since the 1990s, although VL is still a rare disease among transplant recipients[
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. VL is the most frequently observed clinical presentation in this population, followed by MCL and more rarely CL. Fever is the most common symptom of VL in SOT recipients, whereas organomegaly may be less frequent in SOT recipients than in immunocompetent individuals. Immunosuppression seems to predispose to development of MCL caused by viscerotropic strains[
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>-
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Clinical presentation in these patients is almost the same as in immunocompetent persons although sometimes it can be atypical making it much more difficult for the diagnosis, therefore it is frequently overlooked or delayed in transplant patients. The combination of conventional and molecular diagnostic methods may serve as the best approach[
