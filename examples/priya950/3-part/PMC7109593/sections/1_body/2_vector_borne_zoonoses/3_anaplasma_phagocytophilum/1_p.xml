<p>Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is a tick-borne infection caused by 
 <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>, an intracellular bacterium, which commonly infects neutrophils[
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The infection is mostly spread through a bite of 
 <italic>Ixodes</italic> ticks in Europe (
 <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ix. persulcatus</italic>) and in North America (
 <italic>Ix. scapularis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ix. pacificus</italic>) after feeding on infected animals such as domestic (dog, horse) and wild ruminants, hedgehogs and wild boars[

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, there are reports of transmission through infected blood as well as of perinatal transmission[
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Immunocompetent individuals with HGA develop high-grade fever, malaise, nausea, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, CNS and gastrointestinal symptoms. Rarely individuals present with an erythematous rash[
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Whereas anaplasmosis is mostly a self-limiting disease, predictors of a more severe course include advanced age, immunosuppression, and comorbidities such as diabetes[
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Severe course includes the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, peripheral neuropathies, DIC-like coagulopathies, hemorrhagic manifestations, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis and acute renal failure[
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The diagnosis can be confirmed by microscopic identification of morulae in neutrophils on peripheral blood smear or in buffy coat, PCR or serology[
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Based on the few case reports of anaplasmosis in recipients of kidney, pancreas or liver[
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] the incidence of anaplasmosis in transplant recipients does not appear to be high and manifestations of the disease seem to be similar to non-transplant patients. In transplant patients, the clinical presentation commonly involved non-specific systemic symptoms. However, there was also a rather unusual presentation in a kidney recipient in the form of orchitis[
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It was observed that immunosuppressive therapy does not seem to alter acute or convalescent antibody titers[
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with anaplasmosis usually also have a good initial response to treatment with doxycycline[
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
