<p>Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus endemic to eastern North America. In nature, the virus spreads between 
 <italic>Culiseta melanura</italic> mosquitoes found in forested wetlands. Mosquitoes of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> genera may transmit EEEV to humans[
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Most persons infected with EEEV are asymptomatic or they present with a non-specific febrile illness, while less than &lt; 5% develop neuroinvasive disease (meningitis, encephalitis). The case fatality rate is around 50% and many survivors suffer residual neurological sequelae[
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. There is only one report of organ-derived EEEV. In autumn 2017, three SOT recipients (lung, heart, liver) from a common donor developed encephalitis one week after transplantation. Lung and liver recipients died, while the heart recipient survived but had residual tremor. The donor and all organ recipients showed laboratory evidence of EEEV. The fact that all SOT recipients developed encephalitis suggests that the risk of neuroinvasive disease may be increased with this route of transmission. EEEV should be considered in SOT recipients who develop encephalitis after transplantation, particularly if donors and recipients reside in endemic areas of the USA[
