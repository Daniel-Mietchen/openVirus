<p>Scrub typhus is a zoonosis caused by 
 <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic>, an obligate intracellular bacterium. It is a common re-emerging rickettsial infection in India and many other countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Northern Australia (the "tsutsugamushi triangle")[
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. 
 <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic> is transmitted to humans by the bites of the larval life stage of infected 
 <italic>Leptotrombidium</italic> mites (
 <italic>Leptotrombidium deliense</italic> and 
 <italic>Leptotrombidium akamushi</italic>) while field rodents serve as reservoirs. The clinical presentation of scrub typhus ranges from nonspecific febrile illness to potentially fatal multi-organ involvement such as liver, kidney, or lung[
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In some patients, an eschar may develop at the site of mite feeding. CNS involvement (meningitis, encephalitis) has also been observed[
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The diagnosis of scrub typhus is usually made by a single IFA titer against 
 <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> of 400, a seroconversion or a 4-fold increase in IgG titer using paired serum samples[
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. So far, only one study described scrub typhus in a renal transplant recipient in India. The patient presented with fever, headache, meningeal signs, graft dysfunction, and eschar and responded well to intravenous azithromycin and became afebrile within 24 h[
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Since many cases of scrub typhus are underdiagnosed, clinicians should consider in differential diagnosis this potentially fatal zoonosis in regions of endemicity.
