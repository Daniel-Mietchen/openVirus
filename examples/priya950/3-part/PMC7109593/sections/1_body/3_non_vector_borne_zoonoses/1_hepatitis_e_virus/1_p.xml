<p>HEV is a non-enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the family 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic>. Genotypes 1 and 2 are restricted to humans only, while 3 to 8 are zoonotic genotypes. In fragile sanitary infrastructure (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> Asia, Africa, Mexico) genotypes 1 and 2 usually cause human diseases, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 are nowadays found to be the most common genotypes in high-income countries[
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Waterborne, zoonotic and foodborne transmissions are the most common routes of infection, with the primary reservoirs (Europe) being domestic pigs, wild boars, and deer[
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Parenteral transmission, transmission 
 <italic>via</italic> solid organs and blood components has been increasingly recognized[

 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. HEV is diagnosed through serology and nucleic acid amplification test, although, only HEV RNA testing is recommended for the immunocompromised population[
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Hepatitis E virus infection typically manifests as an acute self-limiting hepatitis, but may also present as fulminant hepatitis (pregnant women) or acute-on–chronic liver failure in patients with pre-existing liver diseases or extra-hepatic manifestations[

 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. After solid-organ transplantation, genotype 3 and 4 HEV can be responsible for chronic hepatitis (positive HEV RNA &gt; 6 mo) where the majority of cases are asymptomatic accompanied by mild liver test abnormalities. Chronic infections may rapidly progress to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis[
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Thus far, there have been numerous reports of chronic hepatitis E in the liver, kidney, heart, lungs, liver-kidney, kidney-pancreas, islet cell recipients[
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>,
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Furthermore, extrahepatic manifestations are also common in SOT recipients, including neurological (neuralgic amyotrophy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalitis, myelitis)[
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>], renal manifestations (membranoproliferative and membranous glomerulonephritis)[
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>], as well as thrombocytopenia[
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>] and cryoglobulinemia[
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. After an acute infection, one third of the patients will clear the virus after the reduction of immunosuppression[
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. In other patients (about 60%), the infection will typically progress to chronic forms and lead to the need for additional treatments[
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>,
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. A recent multi-center study which included 255 solid organ transplant recipients, confirmed that ribavirin is highly efficient for treating chronic HEV infection and that HEV RNA polymerase mutations do not play a role in HEV clearance[
