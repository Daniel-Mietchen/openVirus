<p>Rabies virus (RABV) is a neurotropic lyssavirus that belongs to the family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>. With some exceptions (particularly islands), the RABV is found worldwide, however almost all human deaths caused by RABV occur in Asia and Africa. Typical reservoirs of RABV are domestic dog (Africa and Asia), jackal (Africa), mongoose (Africa), fox (Europe, Asia, America), raccoon (America), skunk, coyote (America) and bats (Europe, Australia, America). Humans become infected by the bite of infected animals or by contact with infectious saliva through mucous membranes or breaks in the skin[

In 2004 (USA), four recipients of a liver, kidneys and an arterial segment from a common organ donor with unrecognized rabies developed encephalitis within 30 d after transplantation. The patients presented with fever and altered mental status (confusion, agitation, tremors, and delirium). All patients died within 50 d after transplantation[

Three other recipients (kidney, heart, and liver) did not show symptoms consistent with rabies or encephalitis. All received post-exposure prophylaxis with rabies immune globulin and vaccine and remain asymptomatic[

In 2015, two patients who received kidney transplants from the same donor presented with typical symptoms of rabies and eventually died. In 2016, infected donor organs were transplanted to three patients. Two recipients that were diagnosed with rabies died[
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. In 2016, another two cases of RABV transmission through SOT were reported in China. Two kidney transplant recipients died, whereas a liver recipient did not show any signs or symptoms of rabies or encephalitis[
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. A case of RABV transmission through a kidney transplant was also reported in a child in Kuwait[
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Since the mortality rate of rabies is extremely high, rabies should be considered in patients with acute progressive encephalitis of unexplained etiology, especially for potential organ donors[
