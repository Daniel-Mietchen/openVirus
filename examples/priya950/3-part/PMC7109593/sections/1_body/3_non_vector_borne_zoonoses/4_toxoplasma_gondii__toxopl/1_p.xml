<p>Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease caused by a protozoan 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. It is an obligate intracellular parasite that is widely spread all over the world. Warm-blooded vertebrates are the intermediate hosts where asexual reproduction takes place. This results in the formation of tachyzoites and bradyzoites. Tachyzoites can invade various tissues 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> lungs, CNS and heart but also, they can cause intrauterine infection with possible transplacental transmission to the fetus. Bradyzoites form the tissue cysts in the intermediate host. Felids are the only definite hosts where sexual reproduction occurs resulting in excretion of oocysts into the environment 
 <italic>via</italic> feces. Transmission to humans occurs through the ingestion of water, vegetables, or soil contaminated with oocysts or raw or undercooked meat containing tissue cysts with bradyzoites[

The disease may have an acute or chronic form. The presence of bradyzoites in tissue cysts represents the latent infection which can reactivate at any age. Prenatal transplacental infection can result in intrauterine fetal growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, eye and/or brain damage, fetal death or premature birth. If symptomatic, postnatal toxoplasmosis can present as fever with lymphadenopathy. Chorioretinitis as a manifestation of acquired toxoplasmosis is seen less frequently. Rarely, a potentially fatal disseminated disease, myocarditis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, myositis or encephalitis can be seen in an immunocompetent patients[
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Toxoplasmosis as an infectious complication is a well-recognized entity in SOT recipients. If it presents in the first three post-transplant mo, the graft transmission is most likely, but if it presents after this early period, most often it is the result of the latent infection reactivation or the primary infection. Clinical presentation in SOT patients is more severe as cerebral, disseminated and pulmonary toxoplasmosis is seen more often than mild forms (fever and ocular toxoplasmosis). Even more severe forms with higher mortality are seen in graft transmission[
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>,
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. As toxoplasmosis in SOT patients might be a fatal disease and as at the same time it is a preventable infection, clinicians have to follow the screening and chemoprophylaxis guidelines to optimize the patientâ€™s outcome.
