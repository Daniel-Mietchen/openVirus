<p>Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is an Old World arenavirus distributed in Europe and Americas. The main reservoir of LCMV is a house mouse (
 <italic>Mus musculus, Mus domesticus</italic>), but some other rodents including pet animals may also transmit the virus[
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. LCMV transmission to humans occurs by inhalation of aerosolized excreta/secreta of infected rodents (urine and saliva), bites and contact with rodent blood[
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. LCMV infection in immunocompetent individuals is typically asymptomatic or it presents as nonspecific febrile illness or aseptic meningitis[
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. In contrast, immunocompromised hosts such as transplant recipients develop severe infection with multisystem organ failure and high mortality rate. Several clusters of organ-transplant-associated LCMV infections have been reported in the USA from 2003 to 2013. Signs and symptoms suggestive of LCMV infection occurred in clusters of SOT recipients, in 2003 and 2005. Laboratory testing revealed the LCMV in all the recipients, however, the virus could not be detected in donors. Seven of eight recipients died, 9-76 d after transplantation. In the 2005 cluster, the donor reported contact with a hamster pet, infected with an LCMV strain identical to that detected in the organ recipients. No source of infection was found in the 2003 cluster[

 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. The majority of patients with fatal donor-derived LCMV infection showed hepatitis as a prominent feature[
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. In a recently published study, a case of LCMV infection in a renal transplant recipient that was non-organ donor-derived was described. The patient presented with meningoencephalitis acquired by the exposure to mice excreta. The clinical course was complicated by the development of hydrocephalus, requiring a ventriculoperitoneal shunt[
