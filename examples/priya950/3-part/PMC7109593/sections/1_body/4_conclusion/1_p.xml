<p>This article summarizes the most important emerging and neglected zoonotic pathogens and their clinical presentations in the transplant population. In recent decades, human activities along with climatic changes have led to the shifts in environmental conditions influencing among others, the transmission and distribution of zoonotic pathogens. As the number of zoonotic diseases is increasing, the spreading trends are likely to continue in the future. In parallel, the expanding transplant population worldwide imposes additional challenges for diagnostics and treatment of zoonotic infections. Immunosuppressed state may influence the serologic response and delay diagnosis, modify and aggravate clinical presentation and prolong treatment and recovery. Keeping that in mind is of particular importance in the context of emerging and neglected pathogens which may not be familiar to the wider community of transplant professionals in different geographical locations. The increasing trend of the pathogens transmitted and shared between animals and humans in global and especially transplant population, emphasizes the need for the multidisciplinary approach (“One Health”) in the surveillance and control of zoonotic infections around the world.</p>
