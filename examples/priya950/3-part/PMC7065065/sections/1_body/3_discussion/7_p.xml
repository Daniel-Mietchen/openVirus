<p>The present study has several implications for planning the treatment of neurological complications of arboviruses. Five (55.6%) of the nine patients treated with intravenous immunoglobulin were transferred to a different hospital. On the other hand, none of the patients admitted to a neurology reference hospital were transferred. It appears that only reference hospitals had access to intravenous immunoglobulin, whereas the treatment was not available in other public hospitals. To fill this gap, there is a need for public health decision makers to assure the supply of intravenous immunoglobulin in the public health institutions network. This would likely reduce the need for transfers, which worsen GBS patient outcomes and are costly.
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> We found that it is possible to predict the timing and location of hospitalizations with GBS with a statistical model using data on arbovirus cases. GBS typically presents 1–2 weeks after infection.
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Using our models, if syndromic surveillance detects an increase in arboviruses in a health district, decision makers would have 1–2 weeks to allocate intravenous immunoglobulin to the district's hospitals to prepare for GBS cases.
