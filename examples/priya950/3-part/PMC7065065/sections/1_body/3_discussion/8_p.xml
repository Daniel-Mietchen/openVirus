<p>A limitation of this study is the diagnosis of suspected arbovirus infections. Diagnosis was primarily based on clinical signs and symptoms, which could not be confirmed by laboratory diagnosis in 78.6% of cases. Further, as this study was hospital based, we would not have detected inflammatory polyneuropathies that did not result in hospitalization. In addition, since the analysis was limited to the state of Rio de Janeiro, which had a high incidence of Zika virus, it is unknown whether our conclusions apply to other regions where outbreaks were smaller.</p>
