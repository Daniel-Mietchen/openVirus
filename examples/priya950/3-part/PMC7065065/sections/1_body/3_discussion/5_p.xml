<p>Due to the difficulty of distinguishing among arboviruses in the analysis of syndromic surveillance, we pooled suspected cases of Zika virus and dengue virus into the category of arboviruses. Nevertheless, the model based on Zika alone explained GBS cases better than the model based on Zika + dengue virus (arboviruses). Adding dengue virus to the model failed to improve goodness of fit because the epidemics that occurred in the early 2000s were not accompanied by an increase in GBS, and the incidence of dengue virus was low in 2015–2016.
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> The predictive model was more accurate in the metropolitan area of the city of Rio de Janeiro, which is primarily urban, than across the whole state of Rio de Janeiro, which encompasses urban and rural areas. Poorer accuracy in rural areas could be due to less intensive epidemiological surveillance or fewer
