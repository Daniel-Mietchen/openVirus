<p>Guillain‐Barre syndrome (GBS) is a neuromotor disorder typically preceded by infection. GBS is characterized by ascendant, bilateral muscle weakness with depressed tendon reflexes.
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Approximately 25% of GBS cases result in respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation.
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Treatment involves plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin. Although the most frequent causes of GBS are

 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> During the Zika virus epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the period 2015–2016, it was shown that neuropathies increased.
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> However, until now there has not been a baseline of GBS cases prior to the Zika virus epidemic to provide a comparison with GBS rates reported during the epidemic. To assemble such a baseline, we investigated the extent to which the increase in GBS cases in 2015–2016 was greater or less than other increases over the two previous decades.
