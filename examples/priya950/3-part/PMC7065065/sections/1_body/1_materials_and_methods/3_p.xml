<p>To quantify trends in GBS from 1997 to 2017, we compared the number of cases reported to SIH in a given month to the number the following month. We assessed whether the difference in the number of cases from 1 month to the next was significant using Farrington's outbreak rate test, which is a regression model that predicts the expected number of cases in a given month based on the history of cases in previous months.
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Next, we evaluated the extent to which cases of GBS could be explained by cases of Zika virus and Zika + dengue virus. We used the hhh4 model for areal time series of counts in the statistical software R version 3.5.1.
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> hh4 is a multivariate model in which the number of cases of a disease in a geographic region depends on the number of cases in the region in previous months and a neighborhood matrix that represents the probability of disease spread between regions. To prepare the data for the model, we tabulated the number of cases of GBS, Zika virus, and dengue virus per month in Rio de Janeiro's nine health districts. The number of cases of GBS in district 
 <italic>i</italic> in month 
 <italic>t</italic> depended on the population of 
 <italic>i</italic>, cases of dengue virus and Zika virus in month 
 <italic>t</italic>, the number of GBS cases in district 
 <italic>i</italic> in month 
 <italic>t</italic>‐1, and the neighborhood matrix (supporting information 
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S1 and S2</xref>). The model included all months of the year and had sine‐cosine effects of time to reflect seasonal variation in GBS incidence. Since Zika virus and dengue virus have similar clinical presentations such as febrile illness and rash,
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> we pooled the Zika + dengue virus cases into the category 
 <italic>arbovirus</italic> cases. We also analyzed clinical cases of Zika virus separately from the Zika + dengue virus cases.
