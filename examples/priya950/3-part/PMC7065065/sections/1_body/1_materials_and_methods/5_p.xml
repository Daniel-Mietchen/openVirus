<p>Metro II has a population of 1.9 million and encompasses seven municipalities on the east side of the greater Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area. From 2015 to 2017, 18 hospitals in Metro II reported inflammatory polyneuropathies to SIH. We requested authorization from the hospitals’ research departments to review charts and received permission at eight hospitals that represented 81% of admissions for inflammatory polyneuropathies. We visited these hospitals and used the authorization number from SIH to identify each patient's chart (the same patient had more than one authorization number if hospitalized repeatedly). We transcribed the physicians’ notes about clinical signs and symptoms reported by the patient. Based on this information, we used the classification system proposed by Martyn and Hughes
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> to categorize the inflammatory polyneuropathy as either diabetes, genetic disorder, infectious disease, vaccine‐related, alcohol, or other etiology. We also made note of whether the patient had a lab test for chikungunya, dengue, or Zika virus.
