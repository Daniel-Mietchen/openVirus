<p>We carried out an ecological study in which we observed time trends in the number of hospitalizations with inflammatory polyneuropathy (ICD‐10: G61) and Guillain‐Barré syndrome (G61.1) in the state of Rio de Janeiro reported to Brazil's hospitalization database (Sistema de Informações Hospitalares [SIH], in Portuguese) from 1997 to 2017 (Figs

 <xref rid="ijgo13050-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We analyzed data on dengue virus and Zika virus from Brazil's notifiable diseases database (Sistema de Agravos de Notificação [SINAN], in Portuguese). Zika virus cases are only available in SINAN beginning in 2016 when the virus became notifiable in Brazil.
