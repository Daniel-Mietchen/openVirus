<p>We reviewed charts at eight hospitals, which encompassed 80 (82.3%) of the 97 admissions for inflammatory polyneuropathies. These 80 admissions corresponded to 50 patient charts because some patients were admitted repeatedly. The most frequent causes of inflammatory polyneuropathy were arboviruses (n=14, 28.0%), followed by other viruses (18.0%) (Table 
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Table 
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> reports antecedent conditions and symptoms of inflammatory neuropathy associated with arboviruses. The average age of the patients was 42 years (interquartile range, 27–51 years) and the male:female ratio was 0.67. Of the 14 patients with inflammatory polyneuropathies caused by arboviruses, 12 had classic GBS (85.7%), one had the Miller‐Fisher variant of GBS, and another had progressive idiopathic neuropathy instead of GBS or an arboviral infection.
