<p>The greatest increase in GBS from 1997 to 2017 coincided with the introduction of Zika virus in 2015–2016 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A predictive model based on Zika virus cases explains the temporal pattern of GBS cases better than a model based on Zika + dengue virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). An example is the metropolitan area of the city of Rio de Janeiro (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). The model based on Zika virus predicts a major increase in GBS cases, while the model based on Zika + dengue virus predicts a smaller increase. Dengue virus did not improve the predictive accuracy of the model because there were more than 200 000 dengue virus cases from 2001 to 2010 (supporting information 
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2</xref>), but few GBS cases were reported during this period. The fit of the Zika virus model to the GBS cases is poorer for the entire state of Rio de Janeiro (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A) than for the metropolitan area of the city of Rio de Janeiro (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B).
