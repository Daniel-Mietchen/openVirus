<p>There was seasonal variation in GBS incidence with 15% fewer cases during winter. Zika virus cases were a significant variable for explaining cases of GBS (hhh4 model,

 <italic>P</italic>=0.04; supporting information 
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). The data were compatible with the null hypothesis that Zika virus cases provided a good fit to the GBS cases (calibration test 
 <italic>z</italic>=0.836, 
 <italic>n</italic>=189, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.403). As noted above, due to the difficulty of distinguishing Zika virus from dengue virus, we also pooled the data into the category 
 <italic>arboviruses</italic>. The pooled data were not significant for explaining GBS cases (hhh4 model, 
 <italic>t</italic>=1.59, 
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05; supporting information 
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). When we compared the goodness of fit of the Zika virus and Zika + dengue virus models, the former had lower errors (mean difference=0.044, permutation test 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0049).
