  <p>Cellular infiltration in challenged C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with viable virus particles (10
   <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS), CAF01 delivered RNA (2 μg CHIKV-NoLS RNA complexed with 0.3 mg CAF01), or RNA alone (2 μg CHIKV-NoLS RNA) subcutaneously in the ventral/lateral side of the right foot. Mock inoculated mice received 20 μl VP-SFM media alone or VP-SFM media containing 0.3 mg CAF01. At 30 days post inoculation, all groups except Mock unchallenged mice were challenged (Ch) with 10
   <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT in the ventral/lateral side of the ipsilateral or contralateral foot and monitored daily for footpad swelling. Feet at 6 days post challenge were processed for flow cytometry analysis. The number of neutrophils
