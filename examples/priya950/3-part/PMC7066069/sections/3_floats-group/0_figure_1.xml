   <bold>(A)</bold> CHIKV-WT linearized DNA infectious clone (DNA digest) and 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed CHIKV-WT RNA (IVT) were run on a 1% agarose gel and visualized using GelRed® under UV light. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> CHIKV-WT RNA was transfected into Vero cells using either Lipofectamine® or CAF01. Cells were also mock transfected or transfected with RNA alone. At 12 h post transfection, infectivity (percentage and cell count) was measured by flow cytometry. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> From 29 h post transfection, CHIKV-WT growth kinetics were analyzed by plaque assay. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> CHIKV-WT and CHIKV-NoLS RNA was transfected into Vero cells using either Lipofectamine® or CAF01. Cells were also mock transfected or transfected with RNA alone. Viral growth kinetics were analyzed by plaque assay. Each symbol represents the mean ± standard error from three independent experiments.
