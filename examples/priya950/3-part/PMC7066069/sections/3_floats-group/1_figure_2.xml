  <p>Inoculation with CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 elicits 
   <italic>de novo</italic> viral particle production and disease in AG129 mice. AG129 mice were inoculated with viable virus/vaccine particles (10
   <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS) or CAF01 delivered RNA (2 μg CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA complexed with 0.3 mg CAF01) in the ventral/lateral side of the right foot. Mock inoculated mice received 20 μl VPSFM media or VPSFM media containing 0.3 mg CAF01. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Serum was collected on days 1–6 post inoculation and virus titrated by plaque assay. Survival curves were constructed 
   <bold>(B)</bold> as mice were monitored for the development of disease signs 
   <bold>(C)</bold> and changes in weight 
   <bold>(D)</bold> every 24 h. Disease signs in inoculated AG129 mice were scored on a scale of 0–4 where 4 is humane endpoint. 
   <bold>(E,F)</bold> CHIKV-induced footpad swelling was assessed by measuring the height and width of the perimetatarsal area of the foot, using Kincrome digital vernier calipers. Each symbol represents the mean ± standard error from five to six mice. Statistical analysis was performed by non-parametric Mann–Whitney
