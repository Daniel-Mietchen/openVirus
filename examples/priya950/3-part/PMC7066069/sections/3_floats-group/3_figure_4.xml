  <p>Viremia following CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 inoculation and CAF01 induced footpad swelling in C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with viable virus particles (10
   <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS), CAF01 delivered RNA (2 μg CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA complexed with 0.3 mg CAF01) or RNA alone (2 μg CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA) subcutaneously in the ventral/lateral side of the right foot. Mock inoculated mice received 20 μl VP-SFM media alone or VP-SFM media containing 0.3 mg CAF01. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Serum was collected on days 1–5 post inoculation and virus titrated by plaque assay. Mice were monitored daily for signs of CHIKV-induced footpad swelling in the 
   <bold>(B)</bold> ipsilateral (inoculated) and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> contralateral (non-inoculated) foot. Each symbol represents the mean ± standard error from five to six mice.
