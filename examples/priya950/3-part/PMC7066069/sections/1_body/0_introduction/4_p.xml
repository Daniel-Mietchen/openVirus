<p>Upon entry into cells, the +ssRNA genome of alphaviruses, like mRNA, is rapidly translated by the host machinery to produce the viral proteins required for RNA synthesis and virus replication. In this study, we pioneer the use of CAF01 to deliver the +ssRNA genome of CHIKV-NoLS 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using this novel immunization strategy, we observe 
 <italic>de novo</italic> production of live-attenuated vaccine 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Immunization of mice with one dose of CAF01-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA produced CHIKV neutralizing antibodies and provided regional protection from disease following CHIKV challenge. This study provides the basis for developing CAF01-mediated delivery of replication-competent RNA as a vaccine strategy. Further characterization of the live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine candidate CHIKV-NoLS demonstrates the high degree of attenuation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and potent immunogenicity after one dose.
