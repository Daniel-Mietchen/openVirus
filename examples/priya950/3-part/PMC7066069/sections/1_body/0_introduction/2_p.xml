<p>Our previous studies report the development of a live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine candidate CHIKV-NoLS (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Mutating the nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS) of CHIKV capsid protein, replacing 10 wild-type (WT) amino acids with alanines, significantly attenuates virus replication (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). CHIKV-NoLS is highly attenuated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and mice immunized with one dose of CHIKV-NoLS are fully protected from subsequent challenge with CHIKV-WT (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Additionally, this vaccine shows cross-protection against other arthritogenic alphaviruses (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). A live-attenuated vaccine is a desirable means of disease prevention due to ease of production, low cost, and avoidance of multiple boosters. However, large-scale propagation of CHIKV-NoLS may be limited by its attenuated replication, a common hurdle for the development of many live-attenuated vaccines. The modifications that make CHIKV-NoLS safe and effective for use as a vaccine prevent rapid, large-scale production of the vaccine using traditional vaccine substrates. An alternative vaccine delivery vehicle that removes the need for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> scale-up would remove the production limit on CHIKV-NoLS. RNA has emerged as an effective platform to safely and cheaply deliver vaccines using nanoparticle delivery vehicles such as liposomes (
