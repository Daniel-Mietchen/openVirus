<p>Chikungunya fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). CHIKV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus and has emerged as a major global human pathogen in the twenty-first century as its geographic distribution continues to expand. Epidemics have been reported in the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius, La Réunion, and the Seychelles (270,000 cases in La Réunion in 2005–2006) and India (3–4 million estimated cases in 2005–2011) (

Crippling arthritic symptoms usually involve multiple joints in a symmetric distribution. A high proportion of patients experience prolonged articular pain and arthritis lasting several weeks to years (
