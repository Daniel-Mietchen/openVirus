<p>As a lethal model of CHIKV infection, the attenuation of CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 was tested in AG129 mice. AG129 mice provide an ideal model to determine the virulence and infectivity of 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized virus resulting from CAF01 RNA delivery 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. AG129 mice were inoculated with viable virus particles (10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS) or CAF01-delivered RNA (2 μg of CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA complexed with 0.3 mg of CAF01) subcutaneously in the ventral/lateral side of the foot. Mock-infected mice were inoculated with VP-SFM (vaccine production media) alone or VP-SFM containing 0.3 mg CAF01. Mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease (scored 0–4, where 4 is a humane endpoint), weight loss, and footpad swelling. CHIKV-WT and CHIKV-WT CAF01-infected mice reached endpoint by day 3 post infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that the CHIKV-WT virus produced 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> by CHIKV-WT CAF01 inoculation is as virulent as CHIKV-WT delivered as virus particles at 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu. CHIKV-NoLS-infected mice reached endpoint between days 4 and 7 post infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Results further demonstrate the high degree of CHIKV-NoLS attenuation. CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-inoculated mice presented with disease signs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), including ruffled fur, significantly reduced weight gain compared to mock-inoculated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), and increased lethargy, but recovered from the inoculation. Unlike CHIKV-WT, CHIKV-NoLS, and CHIKV-WT CAF01-infected mice, mice inoculated with CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 presented with no neurological signs of disease to prompt endpoint.
