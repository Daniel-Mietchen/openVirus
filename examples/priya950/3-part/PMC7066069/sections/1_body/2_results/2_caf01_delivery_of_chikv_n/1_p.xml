<p>Having demonstrated the RNA delivery capacity of CAF01 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we sought to determine the potential for CAF01 to deliver replication-competent RNA 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. To investigate 
 <italic>de novo</italic> live-attenuated vaccine production 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we first assessed CAF01 delivery of CHIKV-NoLS RNA in AG129 immunodeficient mice lacking type I and II interferon receptors. AG129 mice were inoculated with viable virus/vaccine particles (10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS) or CAF01-delivered RNA (2 Î¼g CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA complexed with 0.3 mg CAF01) in the ventral/lateral side of the foot. CHIKV-WT CAF01- and CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-inoculated mice develop detectable viremia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similar to CHIKV-WT infected mice, mice inoculated with CHIKV-WT CAF01 developed high-titer viremia by day 2 post inoculation. CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-inoculated mice developed a transient viremia with a similar profile to CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice, albeit with a day delay (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> to produce viable infectious CHIKV particles.
