<p>At 30 days post inoculation, mice were challenged with 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT in the ventral/lateral side of the ipsilateral or contralateral foot and monitored daily for footpad swelling. Mice immunized with CHIKV-NoLS showed no signs of footpad swelling in either the contralateral or ipsilateral leg upon challenge with CHIKV-WT (

All mice inoculated with either CHIKV-WT, CHIKV-WT CAF01, or CHIKV-WT RNA similarly developed no footpad swelling in the contralateral or ipsilateral leg when challenged with CHIKV-WT (
