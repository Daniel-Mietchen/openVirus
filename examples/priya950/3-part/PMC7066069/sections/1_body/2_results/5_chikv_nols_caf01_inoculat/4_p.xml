<p>Interestingly, CHIKV-WT challenge in mice immunized with CHIKV-NoLS RNA resulted in an earlier onset of foot swelling in both the ipsilateral and contralateral feet (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Swelling was also reduced at day 6 post challenge in the ipsilateral foot of mock-CAF01-immunized mice challenged with CHIKV-WT compared to mock-immunized mice, although to a lesser degree than CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-immunized mice. A discernible increase in swelling was observed at day 6 post challenge in the ipsilateral foot of mock CAF01-immunized mice compared to CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-immunized mice. Results suggest CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 immunization provides local but not systemic protection from CHIKV challenge.
