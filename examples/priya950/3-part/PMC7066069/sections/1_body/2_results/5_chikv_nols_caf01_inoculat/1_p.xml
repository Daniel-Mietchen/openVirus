<p>To test CAF01 RNA delivery and the immunogenicity of CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 immunization in immunocompetent mice, C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with viable virus particles (10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS), CAF01-delivered RNA (2 μg of CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA complexed with 0.3 mg of CAF01), or RNA alone (2 μg of CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA) subcutaneously in the ventral/lateral side of the foot. Mock-infected mice were inoculated with VP-SFM (vaccine production media) alone or VP-SFM containing 0.3 mg of CAF01. Mice were monitored daily for signs of CHIKV-induced footpad swelling in the ipsilateral (immunized) and contralateral (non-immunized) foot. CHIKV-WT and CHIKV-NoLS developed a detectable viremia as seen previously (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The viremia in CHIKV-WT CAF01 and CHIKV-WT RNA-inoculated mice developed more gradually and peaked at later times post inoculation compared to those infected with CHIKV-WT but produced similarly high titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Viremia in CHIKV-WT CAF01-inoculated mice peaked at day 3 post infection whereas viremia in CHIKV-WT RNA-inoculated mice continued to rise to day 5. The higher earlier titers in CHIKV-WT CAF01-inoculated mice may be responsible for the reduced viremia at day 5 compared to CHIKV-WT RNA. No viremia was detected in CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 or CHIKV-NoLS RNA-inoculated mice. Results demonstrate that inoculation of C57BL/6 mice with replication-competent CHIKV-WT RNA, in the presence or absence of CAF01, leads to
