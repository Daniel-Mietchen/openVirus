<p>As a single inoculation of CHIKV-NoLS produced levels of IgG similar to those seen in CHIKV-WT-infected mice, the IgG response at later times post CHIKV-NoLS inoculation was examined in separate experiments. No difference in the IgG levels between CHIKV-WT- and CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice was observed up to day 50 post inoculation, demonstrating that the strong IgG response to one dose of CHIKV-NoLS is maintained at later times post inoculation (
