<p>To determine the capability of CAF01 liposome to deliver replication-competent RNA capable of producing live-attenuated CHIKV-NoLS vaccine 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, growth kinetics were examined in Vero cells following transfection. Like CHIKV-WT CAF01-transfected cells, CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 transfection produced live CHIKV-NoLS at 29 h post transfection with increasing titer thereafter (
