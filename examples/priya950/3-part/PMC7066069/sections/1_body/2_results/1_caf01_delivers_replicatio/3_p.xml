<p>Cell transfected with CHIKV-WT CAF01 began to show signs of cytopathic effect at 29 h post transfection (data not shown). To examine the productive replication of CHIKV following CHIKV-WT CAF01 transfection, growth kinetics were analyzed by plaque assay. CHIKV-WT CAF01 transfected cells produced live infectious CHIKV with increasing titer to 53 h post transfection (

With a higher infectivity following transfection, cells transfected with LipofectamineÂ®-delivered CHIKV-WT RNA showed signs of cytopathic effect and produced high CHIKV titers earlier than cells transfected with CHIKV-WT CAF01. Cells transfected with CHIKV-WT RNA alone produced no live virus.
