<p>RNA transfected cells were gently resuspended and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia) and capsid protein-specific antibody (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) with Alexa FluorÂ® 488 anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia). Infectivity was measured as the number and percentage of 488-positive live cells using a BD LSR II Fortessa Cell Analyser and quantified with FlowJo software (v10.6; Treestar, Inc.).
