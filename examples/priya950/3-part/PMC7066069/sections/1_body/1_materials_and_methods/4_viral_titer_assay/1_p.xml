<p>Sera or media containing virus was added in triplicate to Vero cells. Virus was allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator before the virus was removed and the cells overlaid with Opti-MEM containing 3% FCS and 1% agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia) and incubated for 48 h at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Cells were fixed in 1% formalin, and virus plaques were made visible by staining with 0.1% crystal violet. Results are expressed as plaque-forming units (pfu) per milliliter.
