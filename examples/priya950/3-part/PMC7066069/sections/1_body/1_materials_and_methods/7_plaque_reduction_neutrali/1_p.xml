<p>Serum samples were heat inactivated for 30 min at 56°C. A twofold dilution series of serum was produced from an initial 1:10 dilution. CHIKV-WT of 30 pfu was added to diluted serum and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The virus–serum inoculum was added to Vero cells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. A 1% agarose overlay (diluted in 2% FCS DMEM with Pen/Strep) was added to cells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and plaques stained with crystal violet.</p>
