<p>RNA was synthesized by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (IVT) using mMESSAGEmMACHINE™ SP6 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer, from linearized DNA infectious clones. To evaluate RNA concentration from IVT, an RNA standard was made. IVT RNA for standard was purified using QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer and concentration measured by NanoDrop™. Different concentrations of standard were run on a 1% agarose gel together with experimental IVT RNA. A visual approximation of the amount of RNA of interest was made and validated using ImageJ software. Purification of the alphavirus genome post IVT was found to reduce or ablate infectivity. For 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> inoculations, 0.3 mg of CAF01 was added to virus production serum-free medium (VP-SFM) and vortexed at high speed for 5 s. Two micrograms of IVT RNA was added to the CAF01 VP-SFM solution to create a total volume of 20 μl for one dose. The formulation was mixed by vortexing at high speed for 5 s. The formulation was left at room temperature for 30 min with vortexing every 10 min prior to inoculation.
