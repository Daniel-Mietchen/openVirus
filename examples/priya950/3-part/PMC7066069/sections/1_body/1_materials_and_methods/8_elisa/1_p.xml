<p>ELISA microtiter plates (96-well MaxiSorp, Nunc) were coated with 50 μl of CHIKV, purified by ultracentrifugation. Purified virus stocks were diluted in carbonate buffer (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>, NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>; pH 9.5) prior to coating at a concentration of 20,000 pfu/μl. Plates were incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, the virus solution was removed, and 50 μl of blocking buffer [PBS, 0.05% Tween-20 (v/v),5% skim milk (w/v)] was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Mouse serum samples were inactivated for 30 min at 56°C before diluting 1:100 in wash buffer [PBS, 0.05% Tween-20 (v/v)]. A 1:100 dilution was found to be optimal after performing a twofold dilution series (1:50–1:400). Blocking buffer was removed, and 50 μl of diluted serum samples, together with hyperimmune positive and negative controls, was added to the wells. After 1 h of incubation at 37°C, plates were washed four times using wash buffer. Fifty microliters of secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:6,000) or goat anti-mouse IgM HRP (1: 800), was added to each well accordingly and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Plates were washed five times with the wash buffer, and 50 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added per well. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 15 min, 50 μl of 2 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> was added to stop the reaction. Optical density (OD) values were obtained using a Bio-Rad plate reader at 450-nm wavelength.
