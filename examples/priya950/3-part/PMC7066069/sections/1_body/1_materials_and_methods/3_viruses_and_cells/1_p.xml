<p>Vero cells were cultured in Opti-MEM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia), supplemented with 3% fetal calf serum (FCS). Virus and live-attenuated CHIKV-NoLS were propagated in Vero cells cultured in VP-SFM serum-free, ultra-low protein medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia). RNA transfections carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For CAF01 RNA transfections, 0.3 mg of CAF01 was added to 500 μl of VP-SFM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia) and vortexed at high speed for 5 s. One microgram of RNA was added to the CAF01 VP-SFM solution and mixed by vortexing at high speed for 5 s. The mixture was left at room temperature for 30 min with vortexing every 10 min. The reaction was added to confluent Vero cells that had been washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After 1 h, 500 μl of VP-SFM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia) was added to the reaction.</p>
