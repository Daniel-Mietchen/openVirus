<p>Interestingly, CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-inoculated C57BL/6 mice, although protected from CHIKV disease when challenged at the site of inoculation, did not develop systemic protection from CHIKV challenge. In fact, an early onset of severe disease was seen in these mice when challenged in the contralateral foot. A similar disease profile was observed in the contralateral and ipsilateral feet of CHIKV-NoLS RNA-inoculated mice. This enhancement of inflammation has been observed in previous CHIKV vaccination strategies and likened to a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). ADE occurs when antibodies with sub-neutralizing capacity enhance infectivity and disease severity rather than provide protection. In CHIKV-infected mice, higher viral RNA loads and more severe joint inflammation have been observed in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of CHIKV-specific antibodies, demonstrating the role of antibody-mediated enhancement during CHIKV infection and pathogenesis (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). With significantly low levels of IgG in CHIKV-NoLS CAF01- compared to CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice, as well as reduced neutralizing antibodies, it is possible that antibody-mediated enhancement is responsible for the early onset of severe swelling seen in CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 and CHIKV-NoLS RNA-challenged mice. The kinetics of infection upon challenge in the ankle tissue and serum require further investigation to fully demonstrate an ADE-like effect. However, these important observations reveal the need to assess vaccine candidates for the potential to cause disease enhancement, particularly vaccines that require booster regimes and where compliance in completing a vaccination booster schedule may be an issue. Vaccine strategies such as CHIKV-NoLS, and other live-attenuated vaccine candidates, that elicit a long-lasting IgG response after one dose have the potential to overcome these hurdles.
