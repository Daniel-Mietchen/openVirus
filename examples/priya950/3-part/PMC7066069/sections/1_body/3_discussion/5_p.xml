<p>The protective effect of CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 inoculation in the ipsilateral foot upon CHIKV-WT challenge likely involves the local inflammatory response stimulated by the CAF01 glycolipid adjuvant during vaccination. Results also suggest that immune mechanisms, in addition to neutralizing antibodies, mediate local protection from CHIKV disease in mice. Further studies are ongoing to evaluate the systemic protective effect of CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 using prime boost strategies and more clinically relevant sites of inoculation, including intramuscular sites.</p>
