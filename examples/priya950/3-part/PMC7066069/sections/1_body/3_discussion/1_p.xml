<p>The use of this novel liposome delivery system has a number of potential benefits over a traditional live-attenuated vaccine: (1) CHIKV-NoLS is currently passaged in Vero cells, an acceptable vaccine substrate, using VP-SFM, a serum-free, ultra-low-protein medium, and administered 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> as a live-attenuated virus particle. Despite previous studies demonstrating attenuated replication is maintained after serial passage, extended 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> passage of an RNA virus such as CHIKV-NoLS, with no proofreading machinery, could lead to unwanted mutations in the virus genome and the potential to revert to a WT phenotype (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Bypassing 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> propagation of CHIKV-NoLS by using liposomes to deliver CHIKV-NoLS RNA directly 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, initiating CHIKV-NoLS replication and particle production, would reduce the risk of accumulating deleterious mutations in CHIKV-NoLS and so reduce the risk of reversion to a WT phenotype. (2) As propagation of CHIKV-NoLS is limited by its attenuated replication, liposomal delivery of CHIKV-NoLS RNA would remove this inefficient production step and eliminate tissue culture-related by-product contamination. (3) CHIKV-NoLS particles are currently stored at −80°C to remain viable. Liposome/CHIKV-NoLS RNA formulations can be stored as a lyophilized powder at 2–8°C and reconstituted prior to immunization. Being able to store a vaccine this way is hugely cost-effective and would give target populations greater access to this vaccine. (4) Using adjuvanted liposomes, such as CAF01, which induces antigen-presenting cells, to deliver CHIKV-NoLS RNA will further promote a broad and long-lived immune response. Delivery of CHIKV-NoLS RNA using CAF01 has the potential to reduce the overall infectious vaccine dose while maintaining or improving the protective immune response to CHIKV-NoLS.
