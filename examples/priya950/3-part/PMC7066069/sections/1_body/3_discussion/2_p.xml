<p>RNA has emerged as an effective platform to safely and cheaply deliver vaccines using delivery vehicles such as liposomes (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Where DNA-based vaccine approaches risk chromosomal integration and potential mutagenesis, RNA vaccines overcome this threat (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). A number of promising RNA-based therapeutic and vaccine strategies have been recently developed to combat arboviruses using lipid delivery techniques (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the use of CAF01 as an RNA delivery vehicle. Furthermore, our approach of delivering the replication-competent RNA genome of a live-attenuated vaccine candidate using CAF01 is highly novel. CAF01 has been shown to be a safe and tolerable approach to vaccine delivery in clinical trials (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). CAF01 successfully delivered replication-competent RNA 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, albeit at reduced efficiency compared to transfection reagent LipofectamineÂ®, which is optimized for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> use and thus not an ideal benchmark for clinical application. Subsequent replication of infectious vaccine is able to overcome the initial low transfection efficiency of CAF01, to potentially increase antigenicity
