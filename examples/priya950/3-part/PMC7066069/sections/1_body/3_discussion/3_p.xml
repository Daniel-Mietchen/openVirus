<p>A degree of footpad swelling was observed in AG129 and C57BL/6 mice inoculated with CAF01 alone. It is likely that the glycolipid immunomodulator adjuvant of CAF01 stimulates a local pro-inflammatory response at the site of inoculation, giving rise to the observed swelling. Such pro-inflammatory reactions have been observed in other vaccination strategies upon the addition of an adjuvant (

Furthermore, it is likely that the local inflammatory response caused by CAF01 inoculation is pronounced in these studies due to the route of inoculation in the footpad. A local inflammatory response may not be have been detected with an alternate route of inoculation, for example, intramuscular. Indeed, vaccination with CAF01 in clinical trials did not cause local or systemic adverse effects besides transient soreness at the injection site (
