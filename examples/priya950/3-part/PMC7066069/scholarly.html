Abstract</div> <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the causative pathogen of chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease causing highly debilitating arthralgia that can persist for months and progress to chronic arthritis. Our previous studies have identified the CHIKV live-attenuated vaccine candidate CHIKV-NoLS. Like most live-attenuated vaccines, attenuated replication of CHIKV-NoLS has the potential to limit scalable production. To overcome production limits, as well as other drawbacks of live-attenuated vaccines, we developed an <i>in vivo</i> liposome RNA delivery system to deliver the self-replicating RNA genome of CHIKV-NoLS directly into mice, allowing the recipients' body to produce the live-attenuated vaccine particles. CAF01 liposomes were able to deliver replication-competent CHIKV-NoLS RNA <i>in vitro</i>. Immunodeficient AG129 mice inoculated with liposome-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA developed viremia and disease signs representative of this lethal model of CHIKV infection, demonstrating <i>de novo</i> vaccine particle production <i>in vivo</i>. In immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, liposome-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA inoculation was associated with reduced IgM and IgG levels with low antibody CHIKV-neutralizing capacity, compared to vaccination with the original live-attenuated vaccine CHIKV-NoLS. One dose of liposome-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA did not provide systemic protection from CHIKV wild-type (WT) challenge but was found to promote an early onset of severe CHIKV-induced footpad swelling. Liposome-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA inoculation did, however, provide local protection from CHIKV-WT challenge in the ipsilateral foot after one dose. Results suggest that in the presence of low CHIKV-specific neutralizing antibody levels, local inflammatory responses, likely brought on by liposome adjuvants, have a role in the protection of CHIKV-induced footpad swelling in the ipsilateral foot of mice inoculated with liposome-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA. Low IgG and CHIKV-specific neutralizing antibody levels may be responsible for early onset of severe swelling in the feet of CHIKV-WT-challenged mice. These results support previous studies that suggest CHIKV is vulnerable to antibody-mediated enhancement of disease. Further studies using booster regimes aim to demonstrate the potential for liposomes to deliver the self-replicating RNA genome of live-attenuated vaccines and offer a novel immunization strategy.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

Introduction</div> <p>Chikungunya fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). CHIKV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus and has emerged as a major global human pathogen in the twenty-first century as its geographic distribution continues to expand. Epidemics have been reported in the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius, La Réunion, and the Seychelles (270,000 cases in La Réunion in 2005–2006) and India (3–4 million estimated cases in 2005–2011) (<a href="#B1">1</a>–<a href="#B3">3</a>). CHIKV has recently become established in the Americas, infecting over 1.5 million people in just 2 years (<a href="#B4">4</a>). The majority of individuals infected with CHIKV develop disease (<a href="#B5">5</a>, <a href="#B6">6</a>). Symptoms of chikungunya disease are characterized by the acute onset of fever and joint pain lasting 7–10 days. Crippling arthritic symptoms usually involve multiple joints in a symmetric distribution. A high proportion of patients experience prolonged articular pain and arthritis lasting several weeks to years (<a href="#B7">7</a>). This chronic form of CHIKV disease contributes considerably to disease burden. Atypical presentations associated with CHIKV infection include hepatitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myocarditis, retinitis, and nephritis (<a href="#B8">8</a>). Increases in mortality have been described in several CHIKV epidemics with most deaths occurring in neonates, patients with underlying medical conditions, and older persons (<a href="#B9">9</a>–<a href="#B11">11</a>). To date, no safe commercial vaccine is available.</p> <p>Our previous studies report the development of a live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine candidate CHIKV-NoLS (<a href="#B12">12</a>, <a href="#B13">13</a>). Mutating the nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS) of CHIKV capsid protein, replacing 10 wild-type (WT) amino acids with alanines, significantly attenuates virus replication (<a href="#B12">12</a>). CHIKV-NoLS is highly attenuated <i>in vivo</i>, and mice immunized with one dose of CHIKV-NoLS are fully protected from subsequent challenge with CHIKV-WT (<a href="#B12">12</a>). Additionally, this vaccine shows cross-protection against other arthritogenic alphaviruses (<a href="#B12">12</a>). A live-attenuated vaccine is a desirable means of disease prevention due to ease of production, low cost, and avoidance of multiple boosters. However, large-scale propagation of CHIKV-NoLS may be limited by its attenuated replication, a common hurdle for the development of many live-attenuated vaccines. The modifications that make CHIKV-NoLS safe and effective for use as a vaccine prevent rapid, large-scale production of the vaccine using traditional vaccine substrates. An alternative vaccine delivery vehicle that removes the need for <i>in vitro</i> scale-up would remove the production limit on CHIKV-NoLS. RNA has emerged as an effective platform to safely and cheaply deliver vaccines using nanoparticle delivery vehicles such as liposomes (<a href="#B14">14</a>).</p> <p>Liposomes are vesicles consisting of phospholipid bilayers. They can be readily manufactured with various lipid compositions in different particle sizes and charges, allowing the tailored design of formulations that are optimal for the delivery of a biomolecule of interest (<a href="#B15">15</a>, <a href="#B16">16</a>). Liposomes have shown potential for the delivery of various therapeutics <i>in vivo</i> including siRNA, miRNA, DNA, and peptides (<a href="#B14">14</a>, <a href="#B17">17</a>). CAF01 is a liposome composed of a cationic quaternary ammonium salt adjuvanted with a glycolipid immunomodulator (<a href="#B18">18</a>). Recent work with tuberculosis and malaria antigens has shown that CAF01-delivered vaccines are able to induce good cellular and antibody responses (<a href="#B19">19</a>, <a href="#B20">20</a>). Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CAF01 has been tested in five phase I clinical trials in combination with four different peptide antigens including a tuberculosis vaccine candidate and an HIV-1 peptide cocktail (<a href="#B21">21</a>).</p> <p>Upon entry into cells, the +ssRNA genome of alphaviruses, like mRNA, is rapidly translated by the host machinery to produce the viral proteins required for RNA synthesis and virus replication. In this study, we pioneer the use of CAF01 to deliver the +ssRNA genome of CHIKV-NoLS <i>in vivo</i>. Using this novel immunization strategy, we observe <i>de novo</i> production of live-attenuated vaccine <i>in vivo</i>. Immunization of mice with one dose of CAF01-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA produced CHIKV neutralizing antibodies and provided regional protection from disease following CHIKV challenge. This study provides the basis for developing CAF01-mediated delivery of replication-competent RNA as a vaccine strategy. Further characterization of the live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine candidate CHIKV-NoLS demonstrates the high degree of attenuation <i>in vivo</i> and potent immunogenicity after one dose.</p> </div> <div class="materials and methods" title="materials and methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Materials and Methods</div> <div class="caf01" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
CAF01</div> <p>The CAF01 adjuvant was manufactured as previously described by the thin-film hydration method (<a href="#B18">18</a>). The two components of CAF01, composed of the quaternary ammonium compound dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA) and the glycolipid trehalose 6,6′-dibehenate (TDB), were synthetically manufactured by Avanti® Polar Lipids, AL, USA. In brief, weighed amounts of DDA and TDB (5:1) were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v), and the organic solvent subsequently was removed by a rotary evaporator, thereby forming a thin lipid film at the bottom of the flask. The lipid film was rehydrated in Milli-Q water (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ cm at 25°C) with 10% trehalose (w/w) by heating for 20 min at 60°C with stirring. Freshly prepared CAF01 was freeze-dried in glass vials as previously described (<a href="#B22">22</a>). The vials were frozen in dry ice, dissolved in acetone for 10 min, and placed on the plate of a freeze-dryer with a temperature of −40°C. At the end of the freeze-drying process, the glass vials containing CAF01 were stored at 4°C until use. The average zeta potential and size of CAF01 alone and complexed with RNA were measured at 25°C using a Nanosizer (Zetasizer Nano Series ZS, Malvern Instruments, UK) with disposable capillary cuvettes. The results are the average of triplicate independent measurements analyzed using Dispersion Technology Software (Malvern Instruments, UK).</p> </div> <div class="generationofrnaliposomeformulation" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Generation of RNA Liposome Formulation</div> <p>RNA was synthesized by <i>in vitro</i> transcription (IVT) using mMESSAGEmMACHINE™ SP6 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer, from linearized DNA infectious clones. To evaluate RNA concentration from IVT, an RNA standard was made. IVT RNA for standard was purified using QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer and concentration measured by NanoDrop™. Different concentrations of standard were run on a 1% agarose gel together with experimental IVT RNA. A visual approximation of the amount of RNA of interest was made and validated using ImageJ software. Purification of the alphavirus genome post IVT was found to reduce or ablate infectivity. For <i>in vivo</i> inoculations, 0.3 mg of CAF01 was added to virus production serum-free medium (VP-SFM) and vortexed at high speed for 5 s. Two micrograms of IVT RNA was added to the CAF01 VP-SFM solution to create a total volume of 20 μl for one dose. The formulation was mixed by vortexing at high speed for 5 s. The formulation was left at room temperature for 30 min with vortexing every 10 min prior to inoculation.</p> </div> <div class="virusesandcells" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 Inoculation Protects Against CHIKV Disease in the Ipsilateral Foot of C57BL/6 Mice Challenged With CHIKV-WT</div> <p>To test CAF01 RNA delivery and the immunogenicity of CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 immunization in immunocompetent mice, C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with viable virus particles (10<sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS), CAF01-delivered RNA (2 μg of CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA complexed with 0.3 mg of CAF01), or RNA alone (2 μg of CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA) subcutaneously in the ventral/lateral side of the foot.

The composition of immune cell infiltrates was assessed at day 6 post challenge in the ipsilateral and contralateral feet. The number of CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils (<a href="#F6">Figure 6A</a>), Ly6G<sup>+</sup>SSC<sup>hi</sup> activated neutrophils (<a href="#F6">Figure 6B</a>), CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes (<a href="#F6">Figure 6C</a>), CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> macrophages (<a href="#F6">Figure 6D</a>), and CD4<sup>+</sup> (<a href="#F6">Figure 6E</a>), CD4<sup>+</sup>IFNγ<sup>+</sup> (<a href="#F6">Figure 6F</a>), CD8<sup>+</sup> (<a href="#F6">Figure 6G</a>), and CD8<sup>+</sup>IFNγ<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href="#F6">Figure 6H</a>) was examined. CHIKV-NoLS RNA inoculated mice, which displayed early onset of severe swelling when challenged with CHIKV-WT, showed a marked increase in all cell types in both the ipsilateral and contralateral feet compared to mock-infected and challenged controls. The number of activated neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes was significantly higher in both ipsilateral and contralateral feet of CHIKV-NoLS RNA-inoculated mice compared to mock-infected controls following CHIKV challenge (<a href="#F6">Figures 6B,C</a>). For both activated neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, the number of cells in unchallenged controls was low and similar to cell numbers in the CHIKV-WT-inoculated group, which was protected from development of swelling upon CHIKV challenge. This suggests that activated neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes are involved in local CHIKV-induced inflammation upon challenge. That activated neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte cell numbers were high in both mock-challenged groups compared to unchallenged controls also emphasizes their involvement in CHIKV disease. Together, these data suggest that cellular infiltrates, particularly activated neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, are involved in the early onset of severe CHIKV disease in CHIKV-NoLS RNA-challenged mice.</p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 6</span></a></div>   <p>Cellular infiltration in challenged C57BL/6 mice.

Antibody Response in CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-Inoculated C57BL/6 Mice</div> <p>CHIKV vaccine studies in mice and non-human primates indicate that neutralizing antibodies are the primary mediator of protection (<a href="#B23">23</a>–<a href="#B25">25</a>). We examined the humoral immunogenicity of CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 in mice receiving a single vaccination, as described above, using virion-based ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization assay. All mice inoculated with virus particles, CAF01-delivered RNA, or RNA alone seroconverted after one dose (<a href="#F7">Figures 7A,B</a>). A significant difference between the IgM levels stimulated by CHIKV-NoLS and CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 was observed at day 6 post inoculation, with higher levels in CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice suggesting a more rapid IgM response (<a href="#F7">Figure 7A</a>). IgM levels peaked at day 6 in CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice, whereas in CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-inoculated mice, IgM levels peaked at day 13 post inoculation. IgM was first detected in CHIKV-NoLS RNA-inoculated mice at day 13 post inoculation, suggesting a delayed IgM response in these mice. CAF01 stimulates a more rapid IgM response than delivery of RNA alone, with almost no IgM detected at day 6 post inoculation in both CHIKV-WT RNA and CHIKV-NoLS RNA compared to higher levels in CHIKV-WT CAF01 and CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 (<a href="#F7">Figure 7A</a>). IgG titers in CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice were detected by day 6 post inoculation (<a href="#F7">Figure 7B</a>). CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice maintained a high level of IgG, similar to that observed in CHIKV-WT-infected mice, at days 13, 21, and 29 post inoculation (<a href="#F7">Figure 7B</a>). CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-inoculated mice developed only low levels of IgG, similar to CHIKV-NoLS RNA-inoculated mice (<a href="#F7">Figure 7B</a>).</p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 7</span></a></div>   <p>Antibody response in CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 inoculated C57BL/6 mice.

No difference in the IgG levels between CHIKV-WT- and CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice was observed up to day 50 post inoculation, demonstrating that the strong IgG response to one dose of CHIKV-NoLS is maintained at later times post inoculation (<a href="#F7">Figure 7C</a>).</p> <p>Inoculation of mice with CHIKV-NoLS vaccine formulations induced antibodies that were able to neutralize CHIKV-WT. Plaque reduction neutralizing antibody titer (PRNT) at day 30 post inoculation was expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution yielding a &amp;gt;80% (PRNT<sub>80</sub>) or &amp;gt;50% (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) reduction in the number of plaques. As a positive control, CHIKV-WT-infected mice produced PRNT<sub>50</sub> of 507 and a PRNT<sub>80</sub> of 94 (<a href="#F7">Figure 7D</a>). No significant difference in the amount of neutralizing antibodies produced by CHIKV-NoLS or CHIKV-WT inoculation was observed. However, CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 and CHIKV-NoLS RNA inoculation produced significantly lower amounts of neutralizing antibody compared to CHIKV-WT inoculation. CHIKV-NoLS inoculation produced a PRNT<sub>50</sub> of 193 and a PRNT<sub>80</sub> of 71 (<a href="#F7">Figure 7D</a>). CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 inoculation produced a PRNT<sub>50</sub> of 24 (<a href="#F7">Figure 7D</a>).

Discussion</div> <p>The use of this novel liposome delivery system has a number of potential benefits over a traditional live-attenuated vaccine: (1) CHIKV-NoLS is currently passaged in Vero cells, an acceptable vaccine substrate, using VP-SFM, a serum-free, ultra-low-protein medium, and administered <i>in vivo</i> as a live-attenuated virus particle. Despite previous studies demonstrating attenuated replication is maintained after serial passage, extended <i>in vitro</i> passage of an RNA virus such as CHIKV-NoLS, with no proofreading machinery, could lead to unwanted mutations in the virus genome and the potential to revert to a WT phenotype (<a href="#B13">13</a>). Bypassing <i>in vitro</i> propagation of CHIKV-NoLS by using liposomes to deliver CHIKV-NoLS RNA directly <i>in vivo</i>, initiating CHIKV-NoLS replication and particle production, would reduce the risk of accumulating deleterious mutations in CHIKV-NoLS and so reduce the risk of reversion to a WT phenotype. (2) As propagation of CHIKV-NoLS is limited by its attenuated replication, liposomal delivery of CHIKV-NoLS RNA would remove this inefficient production step and eliminate tissue culture-related by-product contamination. (3) CHIKV-NoLS particles are currently stored at −80°C to remain viable. Liposome/CHIKV-NoLS RNA formulations can be stored as a lyophilized powder at 2–8°C and reconstituted prior to immunization. Being able to store a vaccine this way is hugely cost-effective and would give target populations greater access to this vaccine. (4) Using adjuvanted liposomes, such as CAF01, which induces antigen-presenting cells, to deliver CHIKV-NoLS RNA will further promote a broad and long-lived immune response. Delivery of CHIKV-NoLS RNA using CAF01 has the potential to reduce the overall infectious vaccine dose while maintaining or improving the protective immune response to CHIKV-NoLS.</p> <p>RNA has emerged as an effective platform to safely and cheaply deliver vaccines using delivery vehicles such as liposomes (<a href="#B14">14</a>). Where DNA-based vaccine approaches risk chromosomal integration and potential mutagenesis, RNA vaccines overcome this threat (<a href="#B26">26</a>). A number of promising RNA-based therapeutic and vaccine strategies have been recently developed to combat arboviruses using lipid delivery techniques (<a href="#B14">14</a>, <a href="#B27">27</a>). To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the use of CAF01 as an RNA delivery vehicle. Furthermore, our approach of delivering the replication-competent RNA genome of a live-attenuated vaccine candidate using CAF01 is highly novel. CAF01 has been shown to be a safe and tolerable approach to vaccine delivery in clinical trials (<a href="#B21">21</a>). CAF01 successfully delivered replication-competent RNA <i>in vitro</i>, albeit at reduced efficiency compared to transfection reagent Lipofectamine®, which is optimized for <i>in vitro</i> use and thus not an ideal benchmark for clinical application. Subsequent replication of infectious vaccine is able to overcome the initial low transfection efficiency of CAF01, to potentially increase antigenicity <i>in vivo</i>.</p> <p>A degree of footpad swelling was observed in AG129 and C57BL/6 mice inoculated with CAF01 alone. It is likely that the glycolipid immunomodulator adjuvant of CAF01 stimulates a local pro-inflammatory response at the site of inoculation, giving rise to the observed swelling. Such pro-inflammatory reactions have been observed in other vaccination strategies upon the addition of an adjuvant (<a href="#B28">28</a>). Furthermore, it is likely that the local inflammatory response caused by CAF01 inoculation is pronounced in these studies due to the route of inoculation in the footpad. A local inflammatory response may not be have been detected with an alternate route of inoculation, for example, intramuscular. Indeed, vaccination with CAF01 in clinical trials did not cause local or systemic adverse effects besides transient soreness at the injection site (<a href="#B21">21</a>).</p> <p>Interestingly, CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-inoculated C57BL/6 mice, although protected from CHIKV disease when challenged at the site of inoculation, did not develop systemic protection from CHIKV challenge. In fact, an early onset of severe disease was seen in these mice when challenged in the contralateral foot. A similar disease profile was observed in the contralateral and ipsilateral feet of CHIKV-NoLS RNA-inoculated mice. This enhancement of inflammation has been observed in previous CHIKV vaccination strategies and likened to a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (<a href="#B25">25</a>, <a href="#B29">29</a>). ADE occurs when antibodies with sub-neutralizing capacity enhance infectivity and disease severity rather than provide protection. In CHIKV-infected mice, higher viral RNA loads and more severe joint inflammation have been observed in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of CHIKV-specific antibodies, demonstrating the role of antibody-mediated enhancement during CHIKV infection and pathogenesis (<a href="#B30">30</a>). With significantly low levels of IgG in CHIKV-NoLS CAF01- compared to CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice, as well as reduced neutralizing antibodies, it is possible that antibody-mediated enhancement is responsible for the early onset of severe swelling seen in CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 and CHIKV-NoLS RNA-challenged mice. The kinetics of infection upon challenge in the ankle tissue and serum require further investigation to fully demonstrate an ADE-like effect. However, these important observations reveal the need to assess vaccine candidates for the potential to cause disease enhancement, particularly vaccines that require booster regimes and where compliance in completing a vaccination booster schedule may be an issue. Vaccine strategies such as CHIKV-NoLS, and other live-attenuated vaccine candidates, that elicit a long-lasting IgG response after one dose have the potential to overcome these hurdles.</p> <p>The protective effect of CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 inoculation in the ipsilateral foot upon CHIKV-WT challenge likely involves the local inflammatory response stimulated by the CAF01 glycolipid adjuvant during vaccination. Results also suggest that immune mechanisms, in addition to neutralizing antibodies, mediate local protection from CHIKV disease in mice. Further studies are ongoing to evaluate the systemic protective effect of CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 using prime boost strategies and more clinically relevant sites of inoculation, including intramuscular sites.</p> </div> <div class="data-availability" title="data-availability"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
