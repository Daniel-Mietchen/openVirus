 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00196-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B). It extends over an area of 16,896 km
 <sup>2</sup> with an estimated population of 153,476 inhabitants, of which 55% are under 20 years of age, with an average density of 8 persons per km

On average, annual rainfall in the area is estimated between 1200 and 1300 mm. Agriculture remains the principal economic activity, but traditional gold mining has increased considerably, leading to massive human migration and important eco-environmental changes.
