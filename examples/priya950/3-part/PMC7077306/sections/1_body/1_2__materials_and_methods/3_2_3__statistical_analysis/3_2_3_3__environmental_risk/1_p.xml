<p>We first investigated the association of CHIKV seroprevalence with environmental variables by univariable logistic regression analysis, including random intercepts for villages and rural communities. We classified environmental variables into quintiles to assess departure from linearity in associations and included these as categorical terms in the models. For each variable, we compared the model fit to a model including the variable as a continuous term. The decision to include variables as categorical or continuous terms was based on the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC). For variables associated with seroprevalence that were highly correlated (Pearson’s 
 <italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.7), we performed a preliminary variable selection based on the lowest likelihood ratio test (LRT) 
 <italic>p</italic>-values and lowest AIC. Due to convergence problems when including all variables simultaneously, we chose a forward model selection approach, starting with the variable with the lowest 
 <italic>p</italic>-value and lowest AIC, adding additional variables in order of increasing 
 <italic>p</italic>-values and AIC. Variables were retained in the model if significantly associated (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). Random intercepts were retained in the final model if these were significantly associated (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) and improved the model fit.
