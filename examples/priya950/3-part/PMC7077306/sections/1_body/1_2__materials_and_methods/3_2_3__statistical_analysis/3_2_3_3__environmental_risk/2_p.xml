<p>To assess spatial patterns in the unexplained variation of seroprevalence by villages, we investigated spatial correlation of village random-effects by semivariogram analysis, as described above. Additionally, we compared model fit of the selected logistic regression model to a geostatistical model that additionally accounted for spatial correlation between village random effects.</p>
