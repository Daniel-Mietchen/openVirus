<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquitoâ€“borne alphavirus that belongs to the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It was first isolated in 1953 from the serum of a febrile patient during an epidemic in the Newala district of Tanzania [

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Acute CHIKV infection in humans can cause a flu-like syndrome associated with a rash and severe arthralgia [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In sub-Saharan Africa, CHIKV is maintained in a sylvatic cycle involving non-human primates as reservoir hosts [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and forest-dwelling mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Sylvatic vectors can be responsible for sporadic cases or small outbreaks among humans living in rural areas [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In urban areas, CHIKV is transmitted among humans by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes [
