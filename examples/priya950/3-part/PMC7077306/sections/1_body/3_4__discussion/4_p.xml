<p>The elevated exposure to CHIKV among human populations living in the rural Kedougou area suggests a high spillover risk from sylvatic into rural or domestic transmission cycles during amplification years. Particularly, gold mining sites that attract a large number of highly mobile individuals may act as hotspots for the emergence and dissemination of new CHIKV strains. Given the abundance of CHIKV vectors in the Kedougou region, the weakness of surveillance systems, and the mass human migrations, strengthening the surveillance system in the Kedougou region, including sensitization on environmental impact of gold mining activities is needed to prevent the establishment of a domestic, human-amplified CHIKV transmission cycle, and the potential global spread of newly introduced virus strains. Finally, due to the potential serologic cross-reactivity between CHIKV and alphaviruses, such as the oâ€™nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), further studies are needed in order to assess the impact of these neglected arboviral diseases in the Kedougou region. However, the lack of ONNV, and other alphavirus detection in mosquito pools collected in the Kedougou region, suggests that the CHIKV seroprevalence that we measure does not represent cross-reactions.</p>
