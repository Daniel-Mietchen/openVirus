<p>Although overall seroprevalence was low in the Bandafassi rural community, CHIKV seroprevalence was significantly higher in gold mining sites where the population density was relatively high, especially among male adults. In addition, during the outbreak in 2009â€“2010, those villages harboring such gold mining sites were most affected by CHIKV [

A similar pattern was also observed during the CHIKV outbreak in 2015, where confirmed cases in the Saraya district clustered in villages where the main gold mining sites were located (unpublished data). This suggests that traditional gold mining, by attracting thousands of indigenous and foreign populations to remote rural areas, particularly close to the forest galleries, may increase exposure of humans to CHIKV through spillover from the enzootic cycle. Moreover, environmental changes linked to human activity in sites with a high human concentration favor the development of domestic larval sites [

However, to better understand the distribution of CHIKV infection in the region, other potential risk factors that could have led to the higher risk, such as mosquito vector populations and the mobility of the gold miners, need to be investigated in the future. Although no chikungunya cases have been previously reported in the Salemata district, the seroprevalence rate was found to be high (&gt;50%). This finding suggests either CHIKV circulation, with many mild or asymptomatic infections, which has been observed in only around 15% of infected individuals [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], or, more likely, it suggests a limited capacity of the surveillance system to detect cases. Limited surveillance in the Salemata district is potentially due to difficult access to health facilities. Indeed, the Salemata district is the most remote area of the region, without sentinel sites, in contrast to the Kedougou and Saraya districts, which have more robust surveillance.
