<p>Seroprevalence against CHIKV was highest in remote areas with low population density. Indeed, individuals living in those areas were 1.24 times more likely exposed to CHIKV than those living in areas with a high population density. This can be explained by CHIKV transmission through spillover via sylvatic mosquitoes, such as 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic>, which is more frequent in rural areas close to the forest galleries, and which was identified as the main vector during the 2009 epidemic [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Indeed, the analysis of adult mosquito collections undertaken in eight localities in the region, including the main gold mining sites (Hafia, Wassangran, Ndebou, Matakossi, Bondala, Tenkoto, Velingra, and Bantako), revealed a high abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic> in these localities, except for Bantako, which exhibited a low abundance. While in Bantako, the species represented 7.9% of the mosquito fauna collected, in other localities the abundance ranged between 40.5% and 81.7% (Diallo, unpublished data). In addition, the univariate analysis showed that populations living close to the forest and to rivers (forest galleries) were significantly more exposed than the others (
