<p>Two years after a chikungunya outbreak in the Kedougou region [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], our survey showed that over 50% of studied individuals had a history of CHIKV infection. Seroprevalence was homogeneously distributed over all age ranges, including very young children, suggesting a simultaneous and recent exposure of the population to CHIKV circulation. Distinctly, continuous endemic circulation of CHIKV within this population would have led to a significant age pattern with increasing seroprevalence by age.
