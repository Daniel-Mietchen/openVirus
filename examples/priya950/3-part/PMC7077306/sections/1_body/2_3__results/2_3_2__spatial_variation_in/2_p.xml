<p>The model that best explained the observed spatial variation in seroprevalence was based on population density (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00196-f001">Figure 1</xref>B) and accounted for clustering of individuals in villages (village random effects). Indeed, seroprevalence was negatively associated with population density, so that for each one-unit increase in population density at the log-scale, the seroprevalence decreased by an Odds Ratio (OR) of 0.76 (0.69â€“0.84) (
