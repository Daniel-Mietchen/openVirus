  <p>Protection efficacy of monoclonal antibodies against RVFV infection in Huh7 cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) RVFV MP-12 strains expressing 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (RVFV-SRluc) amplified in Huh7 cells were mixed with threefold serial dilutions of the indicated neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). The luciferase activity (Luc) was measured via the 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase assay system. The neutralization of RVFV (%) was calculated as (1 − Luc
   <sub>measured</sub>/Luc
   <sub>virus control</sub>) × 100. Sigmoid neutralizing curves were generated through GraphPad Prism 8. Experiments were repeated three times, and the representative results are presented.
