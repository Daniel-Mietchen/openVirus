  <p>Mapping of NAb epitopes based on the polypeptide 
   <sup>409</sup>GSKKCTGDAAFCSAY
   <sup>423</sup> in Gn9a using alanine-scanning mutagenesis. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) These purified segments, coated on a 96-well plate (0.2 μg/well), were incubated with 1332F11 (0.5 μg/mL) and 1331E4 (0.01 μg/mL). Antibody reactivity against each mutant segment was calculated relative to wild-type (WT) Gn9a reactivity by normalizing to the OD
   <sub>450</sub>–OD
   <sub>630</sub> from wild-type Gn9a. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The anti-His antibody (1:5000 initial dilution) was used as positive control. Data are presented as the means ± standard deviations (error bars) from three independent trials. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The critical residues for 1332F11 are labeled with asterisks, and the critical residues for 1331E4 are labeled with black dots.
