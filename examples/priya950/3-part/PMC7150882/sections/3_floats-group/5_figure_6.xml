  <p>Antigenâ€“antibody molecular docking of two NAbs with RVFV Gn. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Overall structure of Gn and 1332F11 complex. Domain III of Gn is presented as green, domain I is presented as pink, and domain II is presented as blue. The red regions in domain III represent critical residues for 1332F11. For 1332F11, dark red indicates the heavy-chain, and light-blue represents the light-chain. CDRs in heavy-chain and light-chain are shown in yellow and dark blue, respectively. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Overall structure of Gn and 1331E4 complex, as presented in (
   <bold>A</bold>).
