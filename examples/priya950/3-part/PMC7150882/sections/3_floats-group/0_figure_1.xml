  <p>Sera response in a rhesus monkey immunized with recombinant human adenoviruses type 4 expressing Rift Valley fever virus Gn and Gc protein (rHAdV4-GnGcopt). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Serum samples were collected at 0 and 210 days after immunization and subjected to ELISA analysis of IgG antibodies to the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) Gn. The titers were calculated as reciprocal endpoints. The cutoff values were calculated as the mean optical density of control serum (1:8100 dilution) multiplied by 2.1. Data are presented as the means ± standard deviations (error bars) from three independent trials. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Serum samples were collected at 0 and 210 days after immunization and subjected to virus neutralization test via RVFV MP-12 strains expressing eGFP (RVFV-SeGFP). The neutralizing antibody titers were calculated using the Reed–Muench method. Data are presented as the means ± standard deviations (error bars) from three independent trials.
