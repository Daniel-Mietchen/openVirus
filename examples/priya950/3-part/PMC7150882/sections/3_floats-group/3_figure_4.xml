  <p>ELISA analysis of NAbs to Gn truncated segments. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) The truncated segments, coated at 0.2 μg/well in a 96-well plate, were incubated with threefold serial dilutions of the indicated NAbs. 1332F11 and 1331E4 were diluted at 10 μg/mL and 3 μg/mL in an initial well, respectively. 32a represents pET-32a empty vector. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The anti-His antibody (1:5000 initial dilution) was used as positive control. The optical density (OD) was measured at OD
   <sub>450</sub>–OD
   <sub>630</sub>. Sigmoid curves were generated through GraphPad Prism 8. Sigmoid neutralizing curves were generated through GraphPad Prism 8.
