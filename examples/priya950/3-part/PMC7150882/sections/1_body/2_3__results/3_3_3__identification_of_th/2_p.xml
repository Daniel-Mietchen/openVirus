<p>To further confirm the residues in Gn9a critical for binding the two NAbs, we mapped these amino acid residues using alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Each amino acid residue in the polypeptides 
 <sup>409</sup>GSKKCTGDAAFCSAY
 <sup>423</sup>, carried by Gn9a, was individually mutated to an alanine (alanine residues were mutated to serine) (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00259-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The results show that six amino acids (G409, C413, G415, D416, F419, and Y423) within Gn9a were critical for recognition of Gn by 1332F11, and seven amino acids (G409, K412, C413, G415, D416, F419, and Y423) were identified as critical in the case of 1331E4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00259-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B). Interestingly, even though 1331E4 and 1332F11 are two distinct antibodies, the six amino acids critical for binding and recognition by 1332F11 were also critical for 1331E4.
