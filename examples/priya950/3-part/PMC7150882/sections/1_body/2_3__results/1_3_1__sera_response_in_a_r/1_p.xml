<p>To isolate monoclonal antibodies from a female rhesus monkey immunized with rHAdV4-GnGcopt after 210 days, we first performed ELISA to measure Gn-specific IgG titers in the rhesus monkey. The Gn-specific IgG titers increased remarkably (

Compared with neutralizing antibody titers in the sera collected pre-vaccination, neutralizing antibody titers in the sera collected 210 days post-vaccination increased obviously (
