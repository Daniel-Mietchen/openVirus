<p>Based on the residues in polypeptide 
 <sup>409</sup>GSKKCTGDAAFCSAY
 <sup>423</sup> that were identified as being critical for recognition by 1332F11 and 1331E4, we used the ZDOCK program to gain additional insights into the molecular basis of NAb binding with RVFV Gn and to determine the possible neutralizing mechanism. Then, the atomic structures of the variable region of NAbs and Gn docking were conducted to generate 2000 possible binding poses, with a ranking based on comprehensive evaluations of computational docking scores. According to the docking scores and experimental mutagenesis data, the most reasonable poses of two NAbs were selected. Computational docking suggested that the two NAbs bound to domain III in Gn in different orientations, even though the epitopes were very similar (

The complementarity determining region (CDR) loops 3 (HCDR3) of the heavy-chain were used to bind a region constituted by residues G415 and D416. Meanwhile, the light-chain bound to residue Y423 through LCDR1 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00259-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). The heavy-chain used its HCDR3 to bind to residue Y423, and the light-chain used its two CDR loops (LCDR1 and LCDR2) to bind to residues G409 and K412, respectively. In this interaction, the key residues G409, K412, and Y423 in Gn provided a platform for binding 1331E4.
