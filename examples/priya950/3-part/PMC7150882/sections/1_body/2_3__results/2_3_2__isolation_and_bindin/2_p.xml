<p>To ascertain the binding affinities of two NAbs, we tested the kinetics of NAb binding to RVFV Gn through BLI. In this assay, the binding affinity (
 <italic>K
  <sub>D</sub>
 </italic>) of two NAbs was measured by the ratio of off-rate values (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>dis</sub>) to on-rate values (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>on</sub>). Compared with 1332F11 (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>on</sub> = 7.78 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> M
 <sup>−1</sup>s
 <sup>−1</sup>), 1331E4 (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>on</sub> = 4.09 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> M
 <sup>−1</sup>s
 <sup>−1</sup>) could bind with Gn more easily. Moreover, 1331E4 (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>dis</sub> = 3.84 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>s
 <sup>−1</sup>) is more difficult to dissociate from Gn than 1332F11 (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>dis</sub> = 1.25 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>s
 <sup>−1</sup>).Therefore, the results demonstrated that the binding affinity of 1331E4 (
 <italic>K
  <sub>D</sub>
 </italic> = 0.938 nM) to RVFV Gn was 17 times higher than that of 1332F11 (
 <italic>K
  <sub>D</sub>
 </italic> = 16 nM)to RVFV Gn, even though the protective efficiency of two NAbs in Huh7 cells was approached (
