<p>Based on the results described above, Gn-specific memory B cells defined as CD19
 <sup>+</sup> CD3
 <sup>−</sup> hIgG
 <sup>+</sup> Strep
 <sup>+</sup> were sorted from PBMCs as single cells through fluorescent cell sorting (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00259">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Fifty-seven pairs of VH-Vκ genes and 47 pairs VH-Vλ genes were amplified from Gn-specific memory B cells. To rapidly express and screen Gn-specific antibody genes, linear expression cassettes containing either the full-length Ig heavy- or light-chain were co-transfected into a HEK293T cell expression system in 96-well plates. Then eight κ subtype antibodies and seven λ subtype antibodies, targeting Gn, were screened from the transfected culture supernatants via ELISA (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00259">Supplementary Tables S1 and S2</xref>). In order to study neutralization activities and the binding characterization of these positive clones, the full-length Ig heavy- or light-chain genes of these clones were cloned into plasmid pCDNA3.4, expressed at large scale using an Expi293F cell expression system, and purified using protein A affinity chromatography. Then RVFV-SRluc was applied to determine whether these 15 purified antibodies could prevent the virus from infecting Huh7 cells. Finally, two NAbs that were screened from these positive clones using VNT exhibited good neutralizing capabilities, of which the median inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) were 0.1678 and 0.3388 μg/mL (

The genes of the heavy-chain variable regions of two NAbs were found to originate from two different germline genes (HV4-2*01 and HV3-18*01), and the light-chain variable regions genes of the two NAbs originated from two different germline genes (KV2S8*01 and LV6-5*01). Two NAbs showed low SHM rates compared with their germline genes, with nucleotide identities ranging from 89.58% to 96.23% for the variable regions in both the heavy- and light-chains (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00259">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). In addition, the VL genes of the two NAbs differed: 1332F11 used a κ chain while 1331E4 used λ chain.
