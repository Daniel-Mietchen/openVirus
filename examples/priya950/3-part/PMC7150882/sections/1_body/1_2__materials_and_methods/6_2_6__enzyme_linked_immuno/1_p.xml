<p>The RVFV purified truncated Gns (Gn1a–Gn10a) and RVFV Gn were coated at 0.2 μg per well on 96-well plates at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed three times with PBST (0.2% Tween 20 in PBS) and blocked with 2% BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were washed three times with PBST, and the threefold serial dilutions of serum samples in PBST containing 0.2% BSA (starting at 1:100 dilution) were added for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBST, and an HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Solarbio, Beijing, China) was added after being washed three times and 2 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> was added to stop the reaction. The optical density (OD) was measured at 450–630 nm (OD
 <sub>450</sub>–OD
 <sub>630</sub>).
