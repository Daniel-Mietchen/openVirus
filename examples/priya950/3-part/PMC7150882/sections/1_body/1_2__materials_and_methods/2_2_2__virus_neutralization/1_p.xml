<p>Sera were heat-inactivated for 2 h at 56 °C before use. Threefold serial dilutions of sera (40-fold in the initial dilution) in 96-well plates (CoStar, Washington, DC, USA) were incubated with an equal volume of RVFV-SeGFP (100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per well) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Huh7 cells (20,000) were then added to each well, followed by incubation in a 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 48 h. The eGFP was detected using Cytation1 (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA). The neutralizing antibody titers were calculated using the Reed–Muench method [

 <sub>50</sub> per well) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Then, 20,000 Huh7 cells were added to each well. The cells were incubated in a 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 24 h. The luciferase activity (Luc) was measured via the 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The neutralization of RVFV (%) was calculated as (1 − Luc
 <sub>measured</sub>/Luc
 <sub>virus control</sub>) × 100. Sigmoid neutralizing curves were generated through GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).
