<p>The RVFV Gn was fractionated via sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then electroblotted to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and incubated with NAb at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL or anti-Gn rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:4000 dilution). The corresponding secondary antibodies labeled with HRP were used at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/mL. The Millipore chemiluminescent substrate (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) was added for detecting RVFV Gn according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
