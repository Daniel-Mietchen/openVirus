<p>The polypeptides 
 <sup>409</sup>GSKKCTGDAAFCSAY
 <sup>423</sup>, contained in segment Gn9a, were subjected to alanine-scanning mutagenesis (alanine residues were mutated to serine) to generate 15 segments, named Gn9b–Gn9p. Each segment was also individually cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET-32a vector, expressed via a prokaryotic expression system, and purified using a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Then, these purified segments were coated on 96-well plates (2 μg/mL, 100 μL/well) and incubated with 1332F11 (0.5 μg/mL) and 1331E4 (0.01 μg/mL). NAb concentrations were determined using median effective concentration (EC50) against Gn9a to ensure that signals were within the linear range of detection. NAbs were detected using an HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Antibody reactivity against each mutant segment was calculated relative to wild-type Gn9a reactivity by normalizing to the OD
 <sub>450</sub>–OD
 <sub>630</sub> from wild-type Gn9a. Mutations were considered critical to the NAb epitope if they did not support reactivity of the NAb.
