<p>The atomic structures of the variable region of NAbs were initially modeled based on their amino acid sequences via Discovery Studio 4.5 (BIOVIA, San Diego, CA, USA). Then, the computational antigenâ€“antibody molecular docking program ZDOCK, integrated in Discovery Studio 4.5, was used to generate a simulation conformation model for NAbs to RVFV Gn, of which the atomic structure was obtained from the PDB database (PDB ID: 5Y0W).</p>
