<p>The kinetics of antibody binding to RVFV Gn proteins were analyzed using biolayer interferometry (BLI) via a ForteBio Octet instrument (Pall Life Science, Port Washington, NY, USA). Briefly, anti-hIgG Fc Capture Biosensors (Pall Life Science, Port Washington, NY, USA) were loaded with antibodies at 20 Î¼g/mL diluted in PBST containing 0.05% Tween 20. After loading, the sensors were washed with loading buffer for 60 s to remove excess unbound antibodies to regenerate a baseline signal. Then, the sensors were placed in wells containing RVFV Gn at serial concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 nM in loading buffer to test the (on-rate) association rate. Finally, the sensors were placed in loading buffer wells to test the (off-rate) dissociation rate. Equilibrium dissociation constant (
