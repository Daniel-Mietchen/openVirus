<p>The linear expression cassettes, which include full-length Ig heavy- or light-chain, served as templates to amplify the full-length Ig gene using specific primers. The full-length Ig genes were ligated into the pCDNA3.4 plasmid for monoclonal antibody large-scale expression using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites using NEBuilder
 <sup>Â®</sup>HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA).
