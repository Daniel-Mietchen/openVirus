<p>In this study, two NAbs that target Gn proteins were isolated from a rhesus monkey immunized with recombinant human adenoviruses type 4 expressing RVFV Gn and Gc proteins (rHAdV4-GnGcopt). We characterized affinities and neutralizing epitopes of these antibodies and further tried to explain possible neutralizing mechanisms through antibodyâ€“antigen molecular docking based on bioinformatics.</p>
