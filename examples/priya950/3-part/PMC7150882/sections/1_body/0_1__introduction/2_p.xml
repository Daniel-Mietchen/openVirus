<p>RVFV is a 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> under the family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> in the order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. RVFV contains a single-stranded, negative-sense tripartite RNA genome consisting of a large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segment [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The L segment encodes viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The S segment encodes NSs protein and N protein in an ambisense manner. The viral glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, are encoded by the M segment [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The Gn and Gc proteins are important structural proteins on the viral surface which mediate receptor recognition and membrane fusion [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The Gn and Gc proteins exist as heterodimers on the surface of virus particles, which is similar to another 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> member, the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several structural studies have indicated that the fusion loop on the Gc protein is shielded by the Gn protein before virus binding to host cells [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, the Gn and Gc proteins are the primary targets for developing vaccines and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). A few decades ago, several studies have shown that there exist virus-neutralizing epitopes on the glycoproteins [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In 2018, Allen et al. isolated some NAbs from rabbits, which were directed to the membrane-distal domain of RVFV Gn and can preclude virus entry into a host cell [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In 2019, Wang et al. isolated eight Gn-specific NAbs from a convalescent RVF patient that can block the binding of virions to the host cells [
