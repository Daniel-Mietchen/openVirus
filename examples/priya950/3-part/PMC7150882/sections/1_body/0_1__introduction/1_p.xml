<p>The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genus in the order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>, poses a threat to both human and livestock health. RVFV can be transmitted by mosquito bite or contact with infected animals. The clinical symptoms caused by RVFV infection can differ according to the severity of the infection, including being asymptomatic (in 30%â€“60% of cases) or causing a weeklong unexplained febrile illness, severe hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, retinitis, and potentially death [

Due to globalization and climate change, Rift Valley fever (RVF) spread to Saudi Arabia and Yemen via infected livestock trade in September 2000, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people, which was the first reported occurrence of the disease outside the African continent [
