<p>In conclusion, we isolated two Gn-specific neutralizing antibodies from a rhesus monkey immunized with rHAdV4 expressing Gn and Gc proteins. The two NAbs could protect host cells from RVFV infection. Moreover, the description of interaction between Gn and NAbs revealed that RVFV Gn might be an ideal target protein for developing vaccines and neutralizing antibodies against RVFV.</p>
