<p>In this study, we isolated two RVFV-neutralizing antibodies from a rhesus monkey immunized with rHAdV4 expressing RVFV Gn and Gc proteins and characterized the key residues for two NAbs. Before isolating a neutralizing antibody to Gn from this monkey, we primarily tested neutralizing antibody titers in sera using RVFV MP-12 strains expressing eGFP, which can be worked with at Biosafety Level 2 [

 <sub>50</sub> of two NAbs through RVFV MP-12 strains expressing 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase in a Biosafety Level 2 laboratory, based on a method modified from previously described luciferase-reporter bioassay with Huh7 cells [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, more experiments are needed to confirm the comparability of this method with the traditional plaque reduction neutralization test. The two NAbs showed good neutralizing activities, precluding RVFV infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.1678 and 0.3388 μg/mL. One of two NAbs uses a κ light-chain and another one incorporates a λ light-chain. Despite the different types of light-chains incorporated by the two NAbs, the germline analysis indicates that both NAbs have relatively low SHM rates. Consequently, the two NAbs demonstrate relatively low binding affinity to Gn. The low SHM rates might be related to the long time after rhesus monkey immunization. Due to RVFV MP-12 being an attenuated virus [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], it is safe to many RVFV-susceptible animals, such as hamsters, cattle, sheep, and pregnant ewes [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, the virus we rescued could not provide us a good method to evaluate the protection efficiency of NAbs in vivo. Further studies are needed to characterize the inhibitory potential of NAbs in vivo.
