<p>However, 1331E4 bound to the apex of domain III via HCDR3, with LCDR1 and LCDR2 interacting with a platform formed by key residues G409, K412, and Y423 in Gn. Among these key residues for the two NAbs, Y423 is unique in supporting Gn binding to the two NAbs. Y423 contacts with 1332F11 LCDR1 via phenolic hydroxyl groups, and contacts with 1331E4 HCDR3 via an oxygen ion. Computational antigen–antibody docking, conducted under the guidance of alanine-scanning mutagenesis data, indicated that all key residues of the antigen should theoretically contact with the antibodies. In fact, our NAb–Gn docking model revealed that only three of the six key residues contribute to 1332F11 binding to Gn, and only three of the seven key residues support recognition of Gn by 1331E4. Numerous factors may contribute to this phenomenon. (1) Some amino acid residues may play a role in the interaction between NAbs and Gn through maintaining Gn conformation, for example, F419 (located in the interior of Gn) and C413 forming a disulfide bond with C402 [

(2) Computational antigen–antibody docking is a method, based on the bioinformatics of protein interaction, for simulating the natural process of an antibody binding to an antigen, so it has some limitations regarding visualization of the interaction between antibody and antigen when compared with a crystalline structure. Therefore, further studies are still needed to describe the particular interaction between Gn and NAbs, including identification of the key residues in NAbs to Gn.
