<p>To explain the possible neutralizing mechanism for 1332F11 and 1331E4, we superimposed the Gn component of our NAb–Gn docking model onto a reported model of assembled RVFV Gn–Gc [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the regions in Gn targeted by the two NAbs are near the fusion loop in Gc. Given these observations, it is speculated that 1332F11 and 1331E4 likely preclude the sterical rearrangement RVFV glycoprotein, hindering the exposure of fusion loops in Gc to endosomal membranes after the virus invades a host cell. The neutralizing antibody RV-Gn1, targeting a similar region as 1332F11 and 1331E4, is speculated to exert neutralizing activities through the same mechanism [
