<p>Computational docking analysis indicated that two NAbs bound to Gn in different orientations, even though they shared similar key residues in domain III in Gn. This might be related to the two NAbs possessing different heavy- and light-chain CDR loops. 1332F11 bound to the region nearby domain II through HCDR3 and LCDR1, forming a trough penetrated by one β-sheet and one α-helix in
