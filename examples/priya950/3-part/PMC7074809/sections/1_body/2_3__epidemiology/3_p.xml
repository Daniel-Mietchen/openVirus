<p>With current vaccination policies, in populations that have received two doses of measles vaccine, the age distribution of measles is shifted into adolescence and adulthood [

In addition to this change in the epidemic curve by age, the number of measles outbreaks has increased in areas with reduced vaccination coverage and in health care settings where there is the presence of vulnerable populations that are not protected by vaccination, such as the very young, the immunocompromised, and patients with underlying immunocompromising illnesses. At this regard, in Italy, in early January 2017, 2851 cases of measles were reported: 73% with age &gt;15 years and 27% pediatric patients, including a fatal case of a 9-year-old patient. Among the patients, 89% were unvaccinated or too young to be vaccinated [
