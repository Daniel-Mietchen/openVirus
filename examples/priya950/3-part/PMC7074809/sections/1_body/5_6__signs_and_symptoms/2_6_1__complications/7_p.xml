<p>There are three rare but serious complications of measles that can involve the central nervous system (CNS). Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a demyelinating autoimmune disease often triggered by viral infections and occurring within days to weeks in approximately 1 in 1000 measles cases. Measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) is more common in hosts with immune system disorders [

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a chronic, degenerative, fatal neurologic disease that occurs on average 7 years after measles, particularly in children infected before 2 years of age, and it is almost invariably caused by wildtype virus. Wendorf et al. described an SSPE case rate of 1:1367 for children under the age of 5, but it should be noted that the highest incidence of SSPE is equal to a case rate of 1:609 for children with measles under the year of life [

Based on the number of cases of measles in children during 1989 to 1991, and the number of cases of SSPE reported to the CDC after those years, it was estimated that the risk of SSPE after measles is 1 per 11,000 cases, 10 times greater than originally thought. Viral genotyping revealed that these SSPE cases were caused by the wildtype measles virus circulating during those years. It appears therefore that vaccination can prevent significantly more cases of SSPE than was originally estimated [
