<p>There is no current standardized therapy for measles. However, often, some antivirals are used alone or in combination. An example of this is ribavirin and interferon Î±. Indeed, there is little literature on therapy and the same indications are mainly based on clinical cases; most of them support ribavirin, especially used at higher doses [

Other clinical evidence would support the use of vitamin A, since it would play a role in promoting epithelial cell turnover, in particular in the respiratory tract and in the intestinal district. The effect of vitamin A is more evident in children under the age of 2 years, although anecdotal cases are also described for adults. The dosage is not well defined, although it would seem that repeated 200,000 IU have clinical effects. Of note, there is no consensus on the dosage of ribavirin. Reported cases were treated with a dosage of 50 mg/kg/day at 1 g every 6 h with or without loading doses. The role of steroids is also discussed, whose utility is described in some case reports of measles pneumonia [
