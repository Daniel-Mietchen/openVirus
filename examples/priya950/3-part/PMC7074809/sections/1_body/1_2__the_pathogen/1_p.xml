<p>MV virions consist of a ribonucleoprotein that is a coiled helix of protein and RNA, and an envelope that bears two types of short surface projections: Hemagglutinin (H) and the fusion (F) proteins. It is possible to differentiate between wildtype measles virus and vaccine-type virus. The gene sequences for nucleoprotein (N) and H are among the most variable of measles and are among the most used to differentiate the various measles genotypes [

Among these, the N, the phosphopolymerase protein (P), and the large protein (L) are complexed with RNA. C and V, which are not structural proteins, interact with cellular proteins and are implicated in the regulation of viral transcription and replication [
 <xref rid="B1-microorganisms-08-00276" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The H glycoprotein is involved in the attachment of the virus to the host cells while the F glycoprotein is involved in the spread of the virus from one cell to another. Unlike many other paramyxoviruses, neuraminidase is not found on the envelope of measles virus [
