<p>After these first sites of replication, MV also spreads to other tissues, such as submucosal tissues, tongue, buccal mucosa, trachea, nose, and skin. Viral persistence in the body has been documented mainly in epithelial cells rather than in lymphocytes that undergo a more frequent turnover [

During the infection, the turnover of the lymphocytes is amplified, but it is not known if it is dependent on the greater cytotoxicity of measles against the lymphocytes or their greater susceptibility to the attack of the immune system [
