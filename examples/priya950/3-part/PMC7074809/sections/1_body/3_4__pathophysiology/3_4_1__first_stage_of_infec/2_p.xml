<p>A mechanism of cellular entry similar to that of HIV has been proposed for MV, via the “trojan horse strategy”, in which MHC class II + CD11c + dendritic cells (which are widely distributed throughout the respiratory epithelium) are used: Where the density of Langerhans cells is characterized by a progressively lower gradient from the upper to the lower respiratory tract. After viral capture from the lumen of the airway, the dendritic cells migrate to regional lymph nodes and transmit MV to lymphocytes, initiating the infection [
