  <p>Examination of A549 cells, chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells infected with H7N9 virus. (
   <bold>A</bold>) A549 cells and (
   <bold>B</bold>) CEF cells were H7N9 virus-infected at MOI of 5 and at 2,4,6,8 and 10 hours post-infection (hpi). The infected cells were stained with anti-influenza A virus and examined using immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy (objective × 40 magnification). The insert showing the virus-infected A549 cells at 4 hpi is an image at higher magnification. (
   <bold>C</bold>) A549 and MDCK cells were infected with untreated (NT) and UV-treated H7N9 virus (UVT) at MOI of 5. At 10 hpi, all cells were stained with anti-influenza A virus and examined using IF microscopy (objective × 40 magnification).
