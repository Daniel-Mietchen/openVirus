Western Blot analysis of A549 cells infected with H7N9 and immunoblotted with antibodies against STAT1 and pSTAT1. A549 cells were mock-infected (M) or infected with UV-treated (UV) and untreated (Inf) H7N9 viruses using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 5. At 16 h post-infection (hpi) the cells were harvested, extracted in boiling mix, and immunoblotted with antibodies against STAT1, and pSTAT1. The anti-actin is a loading control; Figure S2. Gene expression changes in Viral Sensor, Cytokine and Chemokine, ISG, Cell death, Lipid Metabolism and Carbohydrate probe sets in A549 cells infected with H7N9 virus at 10 hour post-infection; Figure S3. Gene expression changes in Viral Sensor, Cytokine and Chemokine, ISG, Cell death, Lipid Metabolism and Carbohydrate probe sets in CEF cells infected with H7N9 virus at 10 hour post-infection; Table S1. qPCR testing of selected host genes of A549 cells infected with H7N9.
