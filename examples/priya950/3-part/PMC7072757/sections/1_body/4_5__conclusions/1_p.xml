<p>Influenza A virus uses three mechanisms to inflict severe reactions in the human host (See review by [
 <xref rid="B45-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). The virus can either induces direct viral pathology, utilizing its innate immune response by up-regulating cytokine and damaging the ECM, followed by the cellular immune response when the cytokine storm is induced. Our studies have shown that H7N9 infections can induce the up-regulation of cytokines and cytokine-related gene expression in both human and avian cells. This cytokine storm is the same mechanism underlying the severe manifestation of H5N1 in humans. However, during avian infection by the H7N9 virus, the HIPPO signaling pathway induces the up-regulation of cancer pathways and down-regulation of metabolic processes, e.g., ECM at the proviral state, maintaining the virus in a self-defense state to repair any tissue damages induced by the cytokines; hence dampening the cytokine storm. We hypothesize that the cross-talk of the HIPPO pathways with other signaling pathways allows the H7N9 virus to remain in its low pathogenicity form in the avian host and this may explain the observation of a non-diseased state during the epidemic of H7N9.
