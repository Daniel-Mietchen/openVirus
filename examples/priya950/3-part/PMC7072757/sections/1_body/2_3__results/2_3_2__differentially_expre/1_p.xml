<p>The host response for H7N9 virus-infected-A549 cells was examined at the global gene expression level using the GeneChip human genome HG U133 2.0 Genome array (Affymetrix). A549 cells were infected with untreated and UV-treated H7N9 virus, and at 2 and 10 hpi, the infected host transcriptome was analyzed. The gene expression data in H7N9 virus-infected A549 cells was normalized, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to cluster the expression changes between samples (

The gene expression changes in A549 cells infected with the virus at 2 hpi, UV-treated virus at 2 hpi and mock-infections, were observed to cluster together. In contrast, at 10 hpi, the gene expression changes in A549 cells infected with the virus and UV-treated virus showed different clustering, suggesting that the gene expression changes are distinctly unique. The gene expression changes were compared with mock-infected A549 cells, and a total of 3517 and 718 genes were differentially expressed in untreated and UV-treated H7N9 virus infections, respectively, at 10 hpi (

In addition, pair-wise analysis of the DEGs at the 10 hpi showed 207 up-and 249-down-regulated genes shared commonly between untreated and UV-treated virus infections (
