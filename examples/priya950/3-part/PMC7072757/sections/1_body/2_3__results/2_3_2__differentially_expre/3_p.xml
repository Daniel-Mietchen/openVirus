<p>Since the 10 hpi time point displayed the most gene expression changes, the DEGs at this time point was used for functional annotation (KEGG pathway enrichment analysis). Generally, functional annotations of the DEGs relating to cell cycle, cellular organization, metabolic processes and immune response pathways were observed, and the top 20 most significant pathways are shown in

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-09-00448">Figure S2</xref>. Pathways relating to influenza A virus and P53 signaling were the most enriched by up-regulated genes for virus infections when compared with UV-treated (

Other pathways, such as Janus Kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling pathway, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions were exclusively up-regulated pathways in virus infection. Induction of these pathways suggested that they were stimulated by an active viral replication in virus-infected A549 cells. In contrast, many metabolic pathways and cell cycle processes were down-regulated during virus infections, while both virus and UV-treated infections commonly down-regulated peroxisome pathway (
