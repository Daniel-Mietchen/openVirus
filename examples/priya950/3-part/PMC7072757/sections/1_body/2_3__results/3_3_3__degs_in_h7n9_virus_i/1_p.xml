<p>The host response for H7N9 virus in CEF cells was next examined in the same manner as with the virus-infected A549 cells, at the global gene expression level using the GeneChip Chicken genome Array (Affymetrix). CEF cells were infected with untreated and UV-treated H7N9 virus, and at 2 and 10 hpi, the infected host transcriptome was analyzed. The PCA of normalized data indicated distinct clusters of expression changes in UV-treated, untreated and mock-infected cells (

The gene expression changes in CEF cells infected with untreated and UV-treated H7N9 virus at 2 hpi, were observed to cluster together. Similar to the findings in virus-infected A549 cells, unique and higher expression changes were significantly observed in virus-infected CEF cells at 10 hpi when compared with UV-treated virus infections. The gene expression changes in CEF cells infected with the virus and UV-treated virus at 10 hpi showed different clustering, suggesting that the gene expression changes were distinctly unique. The gene expression changes were compared with mock-infected CEF cells, and a low number of genes were differentially expressed in untreated (24 genes) and UV-treated H7N9 virus (19 genes) infections, respectively, at 2 hpi (

At 10 hpi, a higher number of genes were differentially expressed in untreated (4626 genes) and UV-treated H7N9 virus (874 genes) infections, respectively. At this same time point of infection, there were 209 up-regulated and 309 down-regulated genes commonly shared between untreated and UV-treated virus infections (
