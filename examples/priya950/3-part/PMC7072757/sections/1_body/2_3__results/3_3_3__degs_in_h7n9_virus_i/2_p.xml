<p>The KEGG pathway analysis showed that the up-regulated genes in virus-infected CEF cells were unlike the finding in virus-infected A549 cells in that there were several pathways commonly observed between the untreated and UV-treated virus infections (

However, HIPPO, MAPK and TGF-Î² signaling pathways were more enriched in the untreated virus-infected CEF cells, suggesting that these pathways were induced during active H7N9 infection. Pathways relating to cell cycle were down-regulated by both untreated and UV-treated virus infections. There were unique metabolic pathways down-regulated in the untreated H7N9 virus-infected CEF cells, which were also observed as being down-regulated in the virus-infected A549 cells. In addition, pathways relating to the lysosome and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum were highly enriched with down-regulated genes in the untreated virus-infected CEF cells.
