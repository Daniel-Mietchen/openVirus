<p>The expression changes of ortholog genes of H7N9 virus-infected A549 cells and CEF cells were compared with the infections of other influenza A virus subtypes (H1N1/WSN, H5N2, H5N3 and H9N2) in the same cell types. The comparison resulted in a hierarchical clustering of the DEGs, and these are represented in the heat map, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00448-f006">Figure 6</xref>A. The results indicated that when compared with other virus subtypes, the expression changes in H7N9 virus-infected cell type are unique, and higher expression changes were induced in both the H7N9 virus-infected CEF and A549 cells. When the KEGG pathways were analysed for each virus subtype at 10 hpi, several pathways were activated during H7N9 virus infections (

In addition, the H7N9 virus infection down-regulated several more metabolic pathways in A549 and CEF cells that were observed to be uniquely different from the other virus subtypes. Surprisingly, there were no significant down-regulated genes observed in the H9N2 virus-infected CEF at 10 hpi.
