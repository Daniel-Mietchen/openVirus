<p>The KEGG pathway analysis of the up-regulated ortholog genes showed that several pathways were shared between the virus-infected A549 and CEF cells, but their induction was displayed with different magnitude (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00448-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). For example, at 10 hpi, influenza A and RNA degradation pathways were more prominent in virus-infected A549 cells, whereas, TGF-Î² signaling pathways were more prominent in virus-infected CEF cells. There were also pathways induced that were unique to each virus-infected cell type. HIPPO signaling pathway was very prominent and unique to virus-infected CEF cells. Unlike A549 cells, the UV-treated virus was also able to induce the activation of many pathways in CEF cells. Ferroptosis pathway was commonly observed in both UV-treated virus-infected cell types, while p53 signaling pathway was common to both virus and cell infections. The functional annotation of the down-regulated ortholog genes indicated that down-regulation of several metabolic pathways were an indication of active H7N9 virus replication in both cell types (
