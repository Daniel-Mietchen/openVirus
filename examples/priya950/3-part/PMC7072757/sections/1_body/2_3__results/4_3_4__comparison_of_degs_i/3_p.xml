<p>To compare the gene expression changes of the H7N9 virus-infected A549 and CEF cells at 10 hpi further, the ortholog replication-dependent genes were integrated with 1561 proviral and 152 antiviral host factor genes manually curated from published siRNA screening studies [
 <xref rid="B21-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Overall, 67 and 107 proviral genes were up-regulated, respectively, in virus-infected A549 and CEF cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00448-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Among these up-regulated proviral genes, 21 genes were found in common between the two cell types and their expression levels were represented by the heat map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00448-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). In contrast, there were lesser number of antiviral genes that were up-regulated in both virus-infected cell types. There were 11 and 13 antiviral genes observed in H7N9 virus-infected A549 and CEF cells, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00448-f005">Figure 5</xref>C), and only two genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00448-f005">Figure 5</xref>B, highlighted in red) commonly observed in both cell types. The functional annotation of the replication-dependent up-regulated ortholog genes with respect to the proviral and antiviral host factors confirmed that TGF-Î² signaling pathway was found to be the common proviral pathway activated in both A549 and CEF cells during H7N9 virus infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00448-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). In addition, the HIPPO signaling pathway was found to be a unique proviral pathway activated in the virus-infected CEF cells.
