<p>Taken together, our findings suggested that infection of A549 and CEF with H7N9 virus could cause significant global gene expression changes, with the most significant changes observed with down-regulated gene expression changes at 10 hpi. To compare the gene expression changes in virus-infected CEF cells to that in A549 cells, orthology mapping was performed and the DEGs compared and shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00448-f004">Figure 4</xref>. As expected, there were higher expression gene changes during infections with the untreated H7N9 virus when compared with UV-treated virus. The gene expression changes in virus-infected A549 cells clustered away from that of virus-infected CEF cells (

Pairwise analysis of the DEGs showed that at 10 hpi, there were more replication-dependent up-regulated genes in virus-infected CEF cells (1548 genes) than with virus-infected A549 cells (716 genes) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00448-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C). There were 184 common replication-dependent up-regulated genes shared in both virus-infected A549 and CEF cells (
