<p>Affymetrix CEL files were generated from GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) version 5.0 (GCOS, Affymetrix, USA) and subsequently imported to AltAnalyze 2.1.0 (Cincinnati, OH, USA) for analysis [
 <xref rid="B23-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Robust multichip average (RMA) method was used to normalize all Affymetrix CEL files. The normalized expression data were clustered using Principal component analysis (PCA). The limma (R package) based moderated t-test, ANOVA, Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery and log
 <sup>Fold changes (FC)</sup> were calculated to identify genes with statistically significant changes between the virus-infected and control (mock) samples. Probes with the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery (adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value) &lt; 0.05 and |log
 <sup>FC</sup>| &gt; 1 were considered differentially expressed. A single gene might be represented by more than one probes, hence, those genes with an adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 and their probe mean |log 
 <sup>FC</sup>| &gt; 1 were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The DEGs in at least one virus at one-time point infection with their corresponding log
 <sup>FC</sup> values were used for average linkage hierarchical clustering using Gene Cluster 3.0 [
 <xref rid="B24-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The heat maps of the clustering were viewed by Java Tree Viewer (version 3.0, Princeton, NJ, USA). Venn diagrams showing the overlap of DEGs in different groups were created using Venny 2.1 [
 <xref rid="B25-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To compare the expression changes of the H7N9 infections in A549 and CEF cells, we have used our previous probe annotation and human ortholog mapping (
 <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> vs. 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B21-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and the human orthologs genes were used for further analysis. In addition, the expression data from our previous work (A/WSN/1933 (H1N1/WSN) (VR-1520), A/Duck/Malaysia/F118/2004 (H5N2/F118), A/Duck/Malaysia/F189/2004 (H5N2/F189), A/Duck/Malaysia/F59/2004 (H5N2), A/Duck/Singapore-Q/F119/1997 (H5N3) and A/Duck/Malaysia/02/2001 (H9N2) virus infections in A549 and CEF cells) [
 <xref rid="B20-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was processed in a similar manner in order to be compared with the expression changes during H7N9 virus infections. The functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs were analyzed using Gene Annotation (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Analysis Resource-Metascape [
 <xref rid="B26-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and minimum overlap of three genes and 
 <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 was used to select the top 20 statistically significant pathways. All microarray data were deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with accession number GSE31524.
