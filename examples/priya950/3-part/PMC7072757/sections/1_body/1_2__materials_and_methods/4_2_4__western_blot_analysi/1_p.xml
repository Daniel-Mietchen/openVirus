<p>Cell lysates were prepared in 1X boiling mix (1% SDS, 15% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 60 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8) and heated at 100 °C for 2 min. The protein sample was separated by SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred on to PVDF membranes using the mini blotting apparatus (BioRad, USA), after which the membranes were washed with PBSA and blocked for 18 h at 4 °C in PBSA containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. The membrane was incubated with the respective specific primary antibody to STAT1 and pSTAT1, followed by the appropriate anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, USA). The protein bands were visualized using the ECL protein detection system (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). In all cases, the apparent molecular masses were estimated using Kaleidoscope protein standards (BioRad, USA).</p>
