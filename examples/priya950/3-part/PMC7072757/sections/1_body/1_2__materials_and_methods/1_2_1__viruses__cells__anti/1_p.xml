<p>Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 strain WSN [A/WSN/1933 (V-1520)] was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), USA. The subtype H7N9 virus (A/Anhui/1/2013) [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was a gift from Dr. Ian Barr, WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza, Melbourne. (A/Duck/Malaysia/F59/2004; A/Duck/Malaysia/F118/2004; A/Duck/Malaysia/F189/2004) and H5N3 (A/Duck/Singapore-Q/F119/1997) and H9N2 (A/Duck/Malaysia/02/2001) viruses were obtained from Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore and were characterized previously [
 <xref rid="B22-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The viruses were propagated in 9 to 11 day old embryonated chicken eggs using standard protocols. UV inactivated virus was prepared at 4°C by exposing the virus inoculum (at a distance of 1cm) to a UV radiation source (λ = 256 nm) for 30 mins. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK, ECACC 84,121,903) cells used for median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID) titration and the human alveolar basal epithelial (A549, ECACC 86,012,804) for the experiments, respectively, were purchased from European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC), and maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep) (Invitrogen, USA). Chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were prepared from 8 to 10 day-old chick embryos and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% (pen/strep) as described in [
 <xref rid="B20-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Virus infections in both A549 cells and CEF cells were carried out in DMEM in 2% FBS, at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. For immunofluorescence microscopy, the anti-NP (Chemicon, San Diago, CA, USA) was purchased. For western blotting, the primary antibodies to STAT1 and pSTAT1 were purchased from BD Transduction Technology, USA; and the anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) peroxidase conjugate from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MI, USA. All experiments involving H7N9 viruses were performed in biosafety level 3 facility according to the Biological Agents and Toxin Act, Ministry of Health, Singapore.
