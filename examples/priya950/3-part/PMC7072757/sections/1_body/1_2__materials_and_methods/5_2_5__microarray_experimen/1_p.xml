<p>A549, and CEF cells were either mock-infected or infected with each virus subtype at MOI of 5. At 2 and 10 hpi, the cells were harvested at 4 °C using RNAlater (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) diluted in 1:1 with PBS buffer, aliquoted, pelleted and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was extracted from approximately 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells using Rneasy mini kit (Qiagen) and quantified using the Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFischer Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 3 µg of total RNA with the GeneChip One-cycle cDNA synthesis kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), followed by synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA using the GeneChip IVT labeling kit (Affymetrix, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions. After cRNA fragmentation, 15 µg of biotin-labeled cRNA from virus-infected A549 and CEF cells was hybridized to the Human U133 2.0 Genome Array and GeneChip Chicken genome Array (Affymetric, USA), respectively. Three independent experiments were performed, and the data analyzed separately. The arrays were washed and stained using the Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetric, USA) and the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, USA) according to standard Affymetrix protocols. Finally, the arrays were scanned with the GeneChip scanner 3000 (Affymetrix, USA). Quality control, GeneChip hybridization and data acquisition were performed according to the standard protocols available from Affymetrix.
