<p>A549, MDCK and CEF cells were seeded onto 13 mm glass cover and infected with each influenza virus subtype at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 as described in [
 <xref rid="B20-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. At 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours post-infection (hpi), the cells were fixed with 4% (

 <italic>w/v</italic>) saponin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in PBS. The cells were labeled with anti-NP and the stained cells were mounted onto slides using Dakocytomation (Dako, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and visualized using immunofluorescence microscope (Model BX51, Olympus, Parkway Center Valley, PA, USA).
