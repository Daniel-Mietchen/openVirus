<p>In order to compare the gene expression profile between different host species, the avian genes were mapped to the human orthologs, as described in [
 <xref rid="B21-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The functional annotation of the ortholog genes confirmed that Type 1 Interferon pathway (TGF-Î² signaling pathway) is the common proviral pathway activated in both H7N9 virus-infected human (A549) and avian (CEF) cells (

In addition, Type III Interferon pathway was also shown to be activated in H7N9 virus-infected A549 cells, and this was confirmed by the qPCR which detected the presence of IL28a in 790-FC when normalized to the house-keeping gene, EF (

The interferon induction also led to the phosphorylation of STAT protein to pSTAT, and this may, in turn, have triggered and expressed other Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). QPCR was able to detect significant FC in ISG involved in antiviral activities, OAS2, RSAD2, and MX1 (
