<p>Severe influenza manifestation in human was reported to be generally associated with the induction of expression genes for inflammatory cytokines and down-regulation of lipid metabolic pathways. When human bronchial epithelial cell line, Calu-3, was used to infect H7N9 Anhui strain and H5N1, more similarities were reported in the transcriptomic analysis than between H7N9 and H7N7 [

In mice studies, where BALB/c mice were infected with H7N9 Anhui strain, increased induction of cytokine genes, and decreased transcription of lipid metabolism and coagulation signaling were reported [

For example, metabolic pathways involving carbon metabolism, N-Glycan biosynthesis, purine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, cell cycle and glycolysis, were down-regulated suggesting that the host processes involving carbon and amino acid synthesis were actively used for virus replication in both cell lines. Other common metabolic pathways involving extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor, adherens junction, and focal adhesion, were also down-regulated, again an indication of active virus replication where the H7N9 virus continued to draw resources from the host in virus-infected cell lines. These observations confirmed the data reported by other studies where ECM pathways were significantly down-regulated in HPAI H7N9 and HPAI H5N1 [

A separate report also described that in human survivors of severe H7N9 infection, related proteins from the hydrolysis of fibronectin and collagens IV were found present in their plasma, suggesting that the ECM pathway was actively involved in remodeling damaged tissues [
