<p>The capacity of an avian influenza virus to adapt to mammalian host is dependent upon several factors (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B8-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). Specific amino acid sequence motifs that are associated with host adaptation have been identified within several different virus proteins. In some specific cases, biological functions associated with sequence-specific motifs have been proposed [
 <xref rid="B9-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In general, the role that these sequence motifs play in mediating species adaptation is poorly defined. Since a significant degree of sequence variation exists among different avian influenza viruses, this is likely to influence the molecular process that leads to host adaptation. As a consequence, host adaptation is expected to be both multifactorial, and to some extent, virus strain-specific.
