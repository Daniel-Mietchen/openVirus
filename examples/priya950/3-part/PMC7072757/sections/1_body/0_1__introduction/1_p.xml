<p>Influenza viruses are an important cause of respiratory infection, and the global disease burden for influenza infections is estimated by the World Health Organisation to be responsible for up to 650,000 deaths annually (

 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae,</italic> and based on antigenic differences in the nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) proteins the influenza viruses can be classified into four types called A, B, C and D. Influenza A viruses can be further subtyped based on the antigenicity of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins, giving rise to 18 HA (H1 to H18) and 11 NA (N1 to N11) subtypes. They have a wider host range than the other influenza virus types, and have been isolated from humans and a variety of different animal species (e.g., birds, pigs, marine mammals). Influenza A virus strains are maintained in aquatic bird populations which are believed to be an important natural reservoir for the influenza A virus strains that infect all other animal species and humans [

In the context of human infections, many regions of the world experience seasonal epidemics involving increased human-to-human transmission of influenza virus and disease burden. These human-adapted viruses are often referred to as seasonal influenza virus, and in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, the circulating influenza virus strains that predominate can vary. Previous influenza pandemics have involved influenza viruses that were transmitted from birds, into swine, and then to humans. Evidence suggests that swine acts as an intermediate species [
 <xref rid="B4-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], enabling the adaptation of avian-origin viruses to an alternative mammalian host prior to infecting humans. The capacity of influenza viruses to evolve and adapt to replicate in these different animal hosts is directly related to their capacity for interspecies transmission. Although it was originally thought that the transmission of avian influenza virus to humans could only occur via an interspecies host (e.g., swine), avian influenza viruses (e.g., H5N1) can also be transmitted directly from birds to humans. However, such events are usually self-limiting, since these viruses do not adapt to efficiently replicate in a mammalian host, and they do not exhibit efficient human-to-human transmission. Influenza virus evolution is the driver for influenza virus interspecies adaptation and transmission, and this is mediated by the high mutation rates and reassortment of genomic segments between two or more influenza viruses. In a relatively small time-scale, new virus variants can be potentially generated, and these two processes have been the basis for past influenza virus pandemics [
