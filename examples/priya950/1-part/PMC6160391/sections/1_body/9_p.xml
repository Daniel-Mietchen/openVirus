<p id="Par10">Although discovered later than type I and type II IFNs, type III IFNs in innate immunity are attracting more and more attention. The potential importance of type III IFNs has been suggested by life-threatening influenza developed in genetically deficiency that leads to impaired production of both type I and type III IFN production in a 9-year-old child (Ciancanelli et al.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>). Clinical trials have displayed that the pegylated IFN-λ can reduce the level of HCV and HBV in patients infected with chronic HCV and HBV, respectively (Zeuzem et al.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>). IFN-λs are also highly expressed in gastrointestinal tracts, and can cure chronic murine norovirus infection without the presence of adaptive immunity (Nice et al.,
