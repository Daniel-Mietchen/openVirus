<p id="Par12">Another breakthrough is the definition of the differential roles of IFN-λs in contrast to type I IFNs in IAV infection using Ifnlr1
 <sup>−/−</sup>, Ifnαr1
 <sup>−/−</sup> and Ifnlr1
 <sup>−/−</sup> Ifnαr1
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice (Galani et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2017</xref>). This study shows that in mice infected with IAV, IFN-λs emerge earlier than type I IFNs and show potent protective function during the early phase of the infection, when type I IFNs are still scarce. Furthermore, IFN-λs treatment induces expression of antiviral genes but not pro-inflammatory cytokines in neutrophils, while type I IFNs induce the expression of both types of genes and are involved in causing inflammation and immunopathology.
