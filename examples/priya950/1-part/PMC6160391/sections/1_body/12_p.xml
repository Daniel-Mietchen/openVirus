<p id="Par13">The different functions between IFN-λs and type I IFNs can be explained by the different STAT complex they activated. When engaged with their receptor complexes, both IFN-λs and type I IFNs activate JAK-family kinases, which phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2. The phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they associate with IRF9 to form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), bind to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) and induces the expression of antiviral ISGs. However, engagement of type I IFNs with their receptor can also activate the STAT1 homodimer which binds to gamma-activated sequence (GAS) and induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Ivashkiv and Donlin,
