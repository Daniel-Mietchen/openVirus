<p id="Par14">In summary, IFN-λs are more advantageous than type I IFNs in defending against influenza virus for several reasons: (1) IFN-λs are produced earlier and in larger amount during influenza virus infection; (2) unlike type I IFNs, IFN-λs are produced and act specifically in respiratory tract, so they do not induce systematic side effects; (3) type III IFNs have potent antiviral activity without mediating inflammation. Therefore, IFN-λs share the therapeutic benefits but eschews many side effects associated with the clinical use of IFN-α/β (Lazear et al.,
