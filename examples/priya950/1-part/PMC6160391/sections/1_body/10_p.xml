<p id="Par11">Most recently, several important breakthroughs have increased the brightness of IFN-位s as a new spotlight in innate immunity. One of them is the determination of the crystal structure of an engineered high-affinity IFN-位3 (H11) in complex with its two receptors, IFN-位R1 and IL-10R. In this structure, the IFN-位3 helical bundle binds to the gorge formed by the two domains at the distal ends of its two receptors to the cellular membrane. In contrast, the two receptors bind to the opposite sides of the helical bundles of type I IFNs (Mendoza et al.,
