  <p>Number of publications for each virus reported in PubMed through the years. CHIKV publications were rare before 2006 (under 10 per year), except during the South-East Asia epidemic in the late 1960s, when it reached around 20 publications per year. Since the La Reunion outbreak, and followed by the Caribbean epidemic, attention has increased tremendously, and publications now number around 500 per year. While Ross River virus has 10â€“20 publications a year since 1979, MAYV and ONNV had less than 10 publications a year until 2015, and only MAYV has slightly exceeded this number since then.</p>
