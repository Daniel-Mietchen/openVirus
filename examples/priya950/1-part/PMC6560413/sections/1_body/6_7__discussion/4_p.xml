<p>On the other hand, the real risk and the severity of an outbreak are difficult to anticipate because little is known about ONNV, MAYV, and RRV. While a surveillance system has been well established in Australia for RRV (as it is a main health problem in a developed country), under-surveillance of ONNV and MAYV is an issue, as well as the low number of clinical studies. Thus, many open questions remain concerning possible under-the-radar outbreaks, the true incidence of the diseases, or their clinical manifestations: What is the real risk of chronicity? Can severe cases occur and which types? Can these infections be directly or indirectly lethal? Since CHIKV is more of a global concern, fundamental knowledge on alphaviruses in general is expanding, and many of these publications also tested their hypothesis on the related ONNV, MAYV, or RRV. As an example, recent findings on the still obscure entry pathway of alphaviruses identified Mxra8 as an entry mediator, not only for CHIKV, but also for ONNV, MAYV, and RRV [
