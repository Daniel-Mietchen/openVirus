<p>Another potential pitfall, if an epidemic were to happen, is the speed of identifying which virus is responsible. Indeed, despite some virus-specific trends such as lymphadenopathy for ONNV, arthritogenic alphaviruses share very similar clinical manifestations that are also common to other arboviruses or other infectious diseases. Because they co-circulate in many geographical areas, an etiological diagnosis without biological testing seems impossible. Moreover, many cases of arbovirus co-infections have been reported, adding a layer of complexity to this problem [
