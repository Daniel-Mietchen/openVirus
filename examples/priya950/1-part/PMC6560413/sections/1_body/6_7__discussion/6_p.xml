<p>Despite the problems stemming from cross-reactivity, it could be a major help in vaccine design, allowing broad-spectrum protection across all arthritogenic alphaviruses. Indeed, broad neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV can neutralize MAYV and ONNV by inhibiting entry and egress [

 <xref rid="B279-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>]. While no licensed vaccine exists for any of these viruses, several candidates have gone or are currently going through clinical trials for CHIKV and RRV, and it is reasonable to expect a CHIKV vaccine in the years to come. The immunity triggered by this vaccine would then need to be evaluated on other alphaviruses to validate its potent broad-spectrum activity. Strengthening the collective commitment of national and international actors and public/private partnerships will be necessary to develop and license vaccines [
