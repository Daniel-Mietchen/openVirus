<p>One of the prerequisites to imagining a worldwide outbreak of any of these alphaviruses is a wide distribution of their mosquito vector. Indeed, no circulation of the disease would occur in a region free from competent mosquitoes. Interestingly, none of these four alphaviruses shares the same vector (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00133-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and they are currently more geographically restrained than the CHIKV vector:

However, globalization, travel, migration, trade, or climatic change might be leading forces of the redistribution of these mosquitoes. Indeed, climate and weather patterns are important factors in the occurrence of epidemics, which have become the focus of many modeling studies. For example, natural climatic and weather trends influenced RRVâ€™s pattern of infection, especially hydrological features [
