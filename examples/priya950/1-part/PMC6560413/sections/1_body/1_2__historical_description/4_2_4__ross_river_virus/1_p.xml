<p>Epidemic polyarthritis has been described since 1886 in rural Australia [

 <xref rid="B64-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Because patients suffering from epidemic polyarthritis had antibodies against RRV, it was thought to be the agent responsible for the disease [

 <xref rid="B66-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In 1971, it was first isolated from an aboriginal boy in Australia [
 <xref rid="B67-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], confirming this hypothesis. Since then, frequent RRV outbreaks have been reported in Australia [
