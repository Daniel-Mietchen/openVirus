<p>Although genetically distinct from CHIKV, ONNV is its most closely related relative [
 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similar to CHIKV, it can cause large-scale epidemics in Africa, but infection by ONNV has never been reported outside of this continent. The first described ONNV outbreak took place during the first half of 1959 in north-western Uganda (Gulu), before it crossed the border to Belgian Congo and Sudan, causing close to 750,000 cases [

 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In 1984–1985, it caused another outbreak in Ivory Coast [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and although it was then called Igbo-Ora virus, it is now clear that it was in fact a lineage of ONNV [

 <xref rid="B41-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A third epidemic took place in southern Uganda in 1996–1997 with 40–80% of the population infected [

 <xref rid="B43-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. More recently (2003), an outbreak in a Liberian refugee camp was reported in Ivory Coast [
