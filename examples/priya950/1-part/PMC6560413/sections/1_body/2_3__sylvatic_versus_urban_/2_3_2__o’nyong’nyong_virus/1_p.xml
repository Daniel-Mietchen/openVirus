<p>Mainly circulating in an enzootic cycle, the vertebrate host of ONNV is not clearly defined. Nevertheless, forest buffalos, mandrills, and duikers were positive for ONNV in a serosurvey in the Congo basin [
 <xref rid="B86-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. 
 <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> and more rarely 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> are the main vectors [

 <xref rid="B89-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Experimentally, ONNV can infect

 <xref rid="B90-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], but 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes have not yet been demonstrated to be carriers in the wild. More likely, as for CHIKV, it switches to an urban cycle where humans are the amplifying host during bigger outbreaks.
