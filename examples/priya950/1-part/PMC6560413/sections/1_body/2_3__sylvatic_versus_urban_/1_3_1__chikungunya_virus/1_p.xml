<p>Between outbreaks, CHIKV circulates in a sylvatic cycle where non-human primates are the main host [

 <xref rid="B80-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], and sylvatic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (such as 
 <italic>Aedes africanus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B78-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], 
 <italic>Aedes furcifer-taylori</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. Dalzieli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], etc.) are the main vector. Even though these mosquitoes are not particularly anthropophilic, sporadic human cases can originate from that cycle if a human is bitten by an infected mosquito in a rural area. While the western African lineage has never switched to an urban cycle, both the Asian and the ECSA lineages are able to circulate in urban cycles between humans (that become the amplifying host) [
 <xref rid="B81-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] and anthropophilic urban mosquitoes (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B82-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Interestingly, while 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is usually the main vector of CHIKV in African urban cycles, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (widely present on La Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean) was the vector responsible for the transmission during the epidemic that bore its name. Indeed, a single mutation, A226V in the E1 glycoprotein, favored the infection and dissemination of the virus in the new 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> vector [

 <xref rid="B85-microorganisms-07-00133" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Interestingly, this same A226V mutation appeared independently in India, Sri Lanka, Cameroon, and Gabon in settings where 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was suspected to be the vector of the disease. This convergent evolution illustrates the ease with which the virus evolves to improve its transmissibility [
