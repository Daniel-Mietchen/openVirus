<p>Alphaviruses are a genus of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family. As arboviruses, they circulate between an invertebrate vector (mosquitoes) and a vertebrate host. They are distributed worldwide and are separated into two groups: the New World alphaviruses responsible for disease with neurological involvement and the Old World alphaviruses (or Semliki forest virus group) that have a rheumatic tropism. The latter, also called arthritogenic alphaviruses, notably include chikungunya virus (CHIKV), now widely distributed, O’nyong’nyong virus (ONNV) located in Sub-Saharan Africa, Mayaro virus (MAYV) in Latin America, and Ross River virus (RRV) in Australia and the Pacific island countries and territories [
