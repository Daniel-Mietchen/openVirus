  <p>Virus replication, shedding, and seroconversion in mice intranasally inoculated with JEV. Four-week-old mice were i.n. inoculated with different doses (10
   <sup>2</sup>, 10
   <sup>4</sup>, or 10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu/50 μL) of the SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 virus. The SCYA201201 virus is marked with hollow symbols (10

   <bold>A</bold>) The viral RNA load in lungs at 3, 5, 7, 11, and 15 dpi is measured using real-time RT-PCR and expressed as RNA copies per gram (Mean ± SEM). (
   <bold>B</bold>) The viral RNA load in oronasal swabs collected at 3, 5, and 7 dpi was measured using real-time RT-PCR assay and expressed as RNA copies per mL (Mean ± SEM). (
   <bold>C</bold>) The sera were collected from infected or uninfected mice at 3, 5, 7, 11, and 15 dpi, and neutralizing antibodies were detected by PRNT. The horizontal dotted lines indicate the limit of detection (*
