  <p>Contact transmission of JEV in mice. Mice were i.n. infected with 10
   <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL of the SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 virus. The sentinel mice were commingled with the infected animals at 24 h post-infection. The SCYA201201 strain is marked with hollow symbols (infected with 
   <styled-content style="color:blue">○</styled-content> and sentinel with 
   <styled-content style="color:blue">◇</styled-content>), while the SA14-14-2 strain is marked with solid symbols (infected with 
   <styled-content style="color:red">●</styled-content> and sentinel with 
   <styled-content style="color:red">◆</styled-content>). (
   <bold>A</bold>) The viral RNA load in the mice lungs harvested at 3, 5, and 7 dpi was measured using real-time RT-PCR. The horizontal dotted lines indicate the limit of detection (**** 
   <italic>P</italic> ˂ 0.0001). (
   <bold>B</bold>) The virus titer in the lung samples was determined by plaque assay and was presented using plaque-forming units (pfu) per gram of lung tissue.
