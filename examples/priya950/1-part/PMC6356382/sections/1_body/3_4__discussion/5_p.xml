<p>We show that aerosol transmission is possible in mice, which could greatly impact the study of JEV epidemiology and ecology. Although the vaccine strain SA14-14-2 is less virulent than the SCYA2010201 strain, both the sentinel groups of the animals had viral RNA present in the lungs at 7 dpi. The plaque assays also confirmed the presence of infectious virus in the lungs, albeit to a lesser degree, at 7 dpi, in the sentinel animals. The cage setup completely prevented direct contact of the infected and sentinel animals, further confirming aerosol transmission as the source of infection. Aerosol infection via a nebulizing apparatus has been assessed for JEV in mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats, and squirrel monkeys [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All these species have the potential to be infected with JEV, with mortality in mice and hamsters. Compared with the intranasal inoculation, the virus can be delivered into the lungs more deeply through an aerosol infection generated by a specific apparatus. No mortality was observed in our study, although a high viral load was detected in the infected mouse lungs and brains. This is probably due to differences in the virus strain and dose and the mouse breeds used in these studies. It is necessary in parallel under the same conditions to compare both intranasal and aerosol infections in JEV tissue tropism and disease progress in future studies.
