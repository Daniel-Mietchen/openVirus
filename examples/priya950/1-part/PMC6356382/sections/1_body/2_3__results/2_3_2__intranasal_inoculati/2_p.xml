<p>No significant difference in the viral RNA load was detected in the lungs of the SCYA201201-infected mice at 3, 5, and 7 dpi when compared to those inoculated with the SA14-14-2 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00087-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). These results are not in agreement with those obtained in the first mouse study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00087-f001">Figure 1</xref>), in which the mice were inoculated similarly with 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL of each virus. To confirm the results in the first two mouse studies, two groups of 21 mice were i.n. inoculated with 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL of each virus. As expected, the viral RNA load in the mouse lungs was comparable to the two aforementioned experiments. Furthermore, a significantly higher viral RNA load was found in the lungs of the mice inoculated with the SCYA201201 virus at 3, 6, 7, 11, and 15 dpi but not at 4 and 5 dpi. The observed differences are most likely due to the variation in inoculation efficiency. Noticeably, high viral RNA loads in both 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL of the SCYA201201 and SA14-14-2 infection groups lasted through 15 dpi, indicating that JEV can sustainably replicate in the lungs of mice.
