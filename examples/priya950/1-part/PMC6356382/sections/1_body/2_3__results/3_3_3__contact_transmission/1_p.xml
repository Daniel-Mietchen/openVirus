<p>Two groups of nine mice were i.n. inoculated with 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL with either SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 and housed separately. At 24 h post-infection, nine sentinel mice were placed in each infected group to assess the contact transmission of JEV. Based on our previous results, in which JEV replicated efficiently in mouse lungs and was detected in oronasal swabs of infected mice, we focused on determining the viral loads in the mouse lungs in subsequent experiments. Viral RNA was detected in the lungs of all the contact and infected mice with both viruses at all the tested dates, although to a lesser extent at 3 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). At 5 and 7 dpi, both JEV strains showed significantly higher viral RNA loads in the infected mice than those detected in the sentinel animals by 1–2 orders of magnitude. At the termination of the study on 7 dpi, the sentinel animals showed viral loads of 10
 <sup>5.07</sup> and 10
 <sup>4.80</sup> RNA copies/g in the lungs of the SCYA201201 and SA14-14-2-infected groups, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The presence of the infectious virus in the lungs of all the infected and sentinel animals was confirmed by the plaque assay, with titers of 10
 <sup>1.0</sup>–10
 <sup>3.0</sup> pfu/g on 3, 5, and 7 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Noticeably, SCYA201201 was detected in both the infected and contact mice at 3, 5, and 7 dpi in contrast with SA14-14-2, which was only found at 5 and 7 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). However, a neutralization antibody was not detected in all the serum samples of all the infected and sentinel mice on 3, 5, and 7 dpi (data not shown). This result confirms that the SCYA201201 virus replicates and transmits more efficiently in mice than the SA14-14-2 virus. Taken together, these data indicate the contact transmission of JEV to naïve animals.
