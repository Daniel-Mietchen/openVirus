<p>To evaluate JEV tissue tropism, 2 groups of 15 mice were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> plaque-forming units (pfu)/50 Î¼L of either the SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 virus. A third group of 15 control mice were administered equal volumes and inoculation routes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). On 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days post-inoculation (dpi), 3 mice from each group were humanely euthanized, and their lungs, tracheas, brains, thymuses, livers, spleens, and kidneys were collected for molecular analysis.
