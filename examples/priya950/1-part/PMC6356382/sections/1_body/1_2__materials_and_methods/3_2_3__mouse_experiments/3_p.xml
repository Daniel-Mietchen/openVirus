<p>In the second study, to test dose responses in mice, 6 groups of 15 mice were inoculated i.n. with 1 of 3 different doses (10
 <sup>2.0</sup>, 10
 <sup>4.0</sup>, or 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL/mouse) of either the SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 virus. Then, 1 group of 15 control mice was inoculated with equal volumes of PBS. At 3, 5 and 7 dpi, oronasal swabs were collected, and the viral RNA load was determined using real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Next, 3 animals in each group were humanely euthanized on 3, 5, 7, 11, and 15 dpi. Serum, lung, and brain samples were collected for further analyses. The lung samples were homogenized for qRT-PCR detection, while the serum samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies via the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The lung and brain samples taken at 7 dpi were used for histopathological analyses. In the third mouse study, 2 groups of 21 mice were i.n. inoculated with 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL of either the SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 virus. Then, 1 group of 21 control mice was inoculated with equal volumes of PBS. Next, 3 animals in each group were humanely euthanized on 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 15 dpi, and their lungs were collected at each necropsy date to determine the viral RNA load using qRT-PCR.
