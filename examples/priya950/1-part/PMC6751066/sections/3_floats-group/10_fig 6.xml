  <p>DelNS1 LAIV induces cross protective T cell responses against influenza viruses. (A) Induction of antigen-specific CD8
   <sup>+</sup> and CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells by CA4-DelNS1 LAIV was estimated by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) of 
   <italic>ex vivo</italic> peptide-stimulated splenocytes, followed by flow cytometric analysis. (B) Schedule of T cell depletion and virus challenge. Vaccinated mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 μg of anti-CD8α or anti-CD4 or with both anti-CD8α and anti-CD4 or with isotype control (IgG2b) antibodies on day 17 (D17), D19, and D21 after immunization and day 3 after virus challenge. (C) Mice were challenged with H7N9 virus (10 MLD
   <sub>50</sub>) on day 21 after vaccination and monitored for 14 days. (D) Mice were challenged with mouse-adapted CA4 (H1N1) virus (10 MLD
   <sub>50</sub>) and monitored for 14 days. Body weight data represent mean values ± standard deviations of results from 7 mice. Statistical comparisons between means were performed by Student's 
   <italic>t</italic> test. ***,
