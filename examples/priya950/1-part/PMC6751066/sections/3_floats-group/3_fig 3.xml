  <p>CA4-DelNS1 LAIV vaccination protects mice from both homologous and heterologous virus challenge. (A) Timelines for vaccination and virus challenge. Mice were intranasally vaccinated once with CA4-DelNS1 virus (2 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU), ca-LAIV (2 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU), or PBS and then challenged with virus after 3 weeks. (B to D) Vaccinated mice were challenged with 10 MLD
   <sub>50</sub> CA4 (H1N1) mouse-adapted virus (B), 10 MLD
   <sub>50</sub> H7N9 virus (C), or 100 MLD
   <sub>50</sub> H5N1 virus (D). Body weights and survival were observed for 14 days. Body weight data represent mean values ± standard deviations of results from 6 mice. (E) HI analysis of sera from mice vaccinated with CA4-DelNS1, ca-LAIV, or PBS, collected prior to virus challenge.
