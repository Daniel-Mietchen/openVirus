<p>T cell depletion was performed according to previously established protocols (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Briefly, vaccinated mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 μg of anti-CD8α antibody (clone 2.43) or anti-CD4 antibody (clone GK1.5) or with both anti-CD8 and anti-CD4 or isotype control (IgG2b) antibodies (Bio X Cell) at days −4, −2, 0, and 3. Depletion of T cells was confirmed at day −1 to ensure greater than 98% depletion compared with the results seen with the isotype control. Mice were challenged with H7N9 virus (10 MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) at day 0 and monitored for 14 days.
