<p>Antigen-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were examined after 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> peptide stimulation by ICS. After 3 weeks, vaccinated mice were euthanized; spleens were then removed and homogenized using a cell strainer (BD), and splenocytes were resuspended in DMEM (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS] and P/S). Red blood cells were lysed by addition of lysing solution (BD). Cells were counted and resuspended in DMEM. Cultures (100-μl volumes containing 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells) were grown at 37°C for 1 h with 1 μM NP-specific peptide (GenScript) (for CD4
 <sup>+</sup>-specific NP, RLIQNSITIERMVLS; for CD8
 <sup>+</sup>-specific NP, TYQRTRALV) or no peptide. Brefeldin A (BFA) was then added to reach a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and the cells were incubated for 3 h. Cells were then washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer (2% FBS–PBS) and stained with anti-CD8α-PB, anti-CD4-allophycocyanin (APC), and Zombie (BioLegend) for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were washed and fixed with Perm/Wash buffer (BD) and then stained with anti-gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-phycoerythrin (PE), anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and anti-interleukin-2 (IL-2)-PE/Cy7 (BioLegend) overnight at 4°C. Cells were then washed with FACS buffer twice and resuspended in FACS buffer. The samples were acquired with a BD FACSAria III cell sorter and the generated data analyzed with Flowjo V9. Frequencies of IFN-γ-positive (IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup>) Zombie-negative (Zombie
 <sup>−</sup>) CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell populations were determined. Backgrounds were determined using no peptide in stimulations, and the results were subtracted from the values reported.
