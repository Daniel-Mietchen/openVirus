<p>Eight pHW2000 plasmids containing the DelNS1 segment and the other 7 influenza virus genomic segments, together with an NS1 expression plasmid, were transfected into a 293T/MDCK cell mixture and incubated overnight. The DNA mixture was removed and MEM supplemented with 1 μg/ml N-tosyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma) added. Virus supernatant was collected 72 h later and designated passage 0 (P0) virus and was subsequently passaged in MDCK cells or embryonated chicken eggs. For CA4-DelNS1 virus, rescued virus was passaged in MDCK cells 10 times at 37°C and then a further 10 times at 30°C. For the H3N2 reassortant DelNS1 viruses of CA4-DelNS1-HK4801 and CA4-DelNS1-HK68, 6 plasmids containing CA4-DelNS1 internal genes and H3N2 HA and NA plasmids derived from either A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 or A/Hong Kong/1/1968 virus were used for virus rescue. For influenza B DelNS1 virus DelNS1-B8038, rescued virus was passaged 10 times at 33°C in MDCK cells. For all DelNS1 viruses, deletion of the NS1 gene was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing. After several passages, the genomes of DelNS1 viruses were sequenced to identify adaptive mutations.
