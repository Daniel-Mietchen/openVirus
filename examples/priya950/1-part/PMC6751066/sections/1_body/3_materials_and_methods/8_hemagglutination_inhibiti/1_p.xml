<p>Sera from immunized mice were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE; Merck). Control antibodies and sera were then 2-fold serially diluted in 96-well plates. Subsequently, a total of 8 HA units of virus was added into each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and then 50 μl of 0.5% turkey red blood cells was added to the serum/virus mixture followed by incubation for 30 min. The HI titer is defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sera that completely inhibits hemagglutination. For microneutralization assay, RDE-treated sera were mixed with 100 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of virus and were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The mixture was added to confluent MDCK cells in MEM supplemented with 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. Presence of virus was confirmed by hemagglutination (HA) assay. The neutralizing titer is defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sera that completely neutralizes infectivity of 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of virus in MDCK cells.
