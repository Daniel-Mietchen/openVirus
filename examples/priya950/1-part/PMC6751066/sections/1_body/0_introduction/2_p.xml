<p>In recent years, new strategies for the development of novel influenza vaccines conferring superior length and breadth of protection have been extensively explored (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). One strategy involves developing a vaccine that induces antibodies targeting the more highly conserved stem region of the influenza virus HA protein (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Attention has also recently been focused on immunity elicited by influenza virus neuraminidase (NA), which is less variable than HA, but the vaccine applications of this approach have not been fully evaluated (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Besides HA and NA, vaccines based on the conserved ectodomain of matrix protein 2 of influenza virus have been evaluated previously in multiple reports (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Another strategy in influenza vaccine research focuses on using live attenuated influenza viruses (LAIVs) to mimic natural infection and induce both humoral and cellular immunity to influenza virus. A cold-adapted LAIV (Influenza Mist) has been licensed for use in humans aged 2 to 49 since 2007 (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). While HA-based vaccines aim to induce HA-specific neutralizing or stem-targeting antibodies to block influenza virus, LAIVs elicit multifaceted immune responses through limited virus replication in mucosal epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Several studies have used various strategies to make different versions of LAIV based on the A/WSN/1933 virus (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Testing of these conceptual vaccines in animal models indicates that they can cross protect against heterologous viral challenges. These LAIVs generally contain mutations or artificial insertions which attenuate their ability to antagonize host cell expression of interferon (IFN) and antiviral activity; the long-term stability of these mutations and the performance of the attenuated phenotypes in humans are not yet certain, and these LAIVs are not practical for mass production, due to the attenuation of virus replication. Nevertheless, LAIVs are consistently able to induce broader cross protective immunity than current inactivated influenza vaccines. It has long been questioned why natural infections with influenza virus fail to induce broad and long-lasting immunity against future encounters with similar viruses. Influenza viruses are known to block or interfere with innate and adaptive host immune responses. Influenza virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a key virulence element and a strong IFN antagonist, with multifunctional roles in virus replication (see reviews in references 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). While the NS1 protein is not essential for virus replication, it is critical for evasion of host innate immunity and interference with the induction of adaptive immunity during influenza virus infection (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A role for NS1 in airborne transmission of avian H1N1 virus between ferrets has also been shown previously (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Therefore, deletion of NS1 has long been considered a desirable strategy for making safer and more immunogenic influenza vaccines (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). An NS1-truncated vaccine induces strong immune responses and appears to exert better protective efficacy than an inactivated virus vaccine in aged mice (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). LAIVs expressing truncated or mutated NS1 genes in the backbone of H3N2 or H1N1 viruses also cross protect against swine influenza viruses in pigs (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), further highlighting the potential of modified NS1 vaccines for use in preventing influenza. Furthermore, two clinical trials using deleted-NS1-trivalent LAIVs containing influenza virus H1N1, H3N2, and B strains demonstrated induction of significant levels of strain-specific and cross-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated humans (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, influenza viruses with truncated or deleted NS1 grow at relatively low levels of efficiency in MDCK cells (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), which has hampered the commercial development of deleted-NS1 (DelNS1) live attenuated influenza virus vaccine strains. Previous studies published by ourselves and others have reported mutations which support the replication of DelNS1 viruses in MDCK cells and/or embryonated chicken eggs (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). It seems possible that acquisition of adaptive mutations that restore NS1-regulated M splicing during influenza virus infection would increase virus replication ability in interferon-deficient systems (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), providing a practical way to produce sufficient quantities of DelNS1 viruses for use as live attenuated influenza vaccines. It will also be important to evaluate if additional viral antigens can be expressed from the NS segment in the DelNS1 LAIV system to enhance specific immunity to viral targets.
