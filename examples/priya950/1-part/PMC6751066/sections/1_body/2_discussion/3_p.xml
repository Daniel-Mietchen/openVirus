<p>Influenza virus is unique in its ability to infect multiple host species and to sustain circulation in humans despite limited genome coding capacity, which may be partly attributable to the plasticity of the hemagglutinin and NS1 proteins (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Influenza viruses utilize the multiple functions of the NS1 protein to modulate host innate and adaptive immunity, allowing reinfection of humans and mediation of host adaptation (

 <italic>NS1</italic> gene from the viral genome may make the DelNS1 LAIV vaccine a perfect immunogen to prime the host, maximizing the spectrum of B cell and T cell repertoires recognizing most or all viral components, which may be critical for boosting immune responses to conserved epitopes upon subsequent infection with a similar or novel strain. DelNS1 LAIV has the ability to induce high-level protective humoral and T cell responses to influenza viruses. Our data show that cross protective immunity elicited by CA4-DelNS1 (H1N1) is mediated by long-lasting T cell immunity, in particular, by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Importantly, the antibodies induced by CA4-DelNS1 (H1N1) are sufficient to protect mice from lethal challenge with 2009 H1N1 virus, even after depletion of both CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The HK4801/2014 virus is distinct from the HK68 H3N2 strain in terms of antigenicity. However, priming with HK4801/2014 rapidly induces immunity in mice to fully protect them against challenge with HK68-MA virus. One strategy to improve the current influenza vaccine regime is to induce immunities to multiple viral targets. Since NS1 is deleted from the viral genome, there is an opportunity to include other antigens in the vaccine strain; we have demonstrated that expressing the HA1 domain of influenza B virus in the CA4-DelNS1 system protects immunized mice from challenge with B/Brisbane/60/2008 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). The DelNS1 backbones described in this study could therefore be used as viral vectors to express extra antigens to enhance specific immunity against influenza or to serve as vaccines for other respiratory viruses. Further studies are necessary to more precisely define the associated immune responses, in particular, the adaptive immune response, induced by DelNS1 LAIV versus wild-type virus in mice and other animal models. It remains to be investigated whether other biomarkers may more accurately reflect the protective efficacy of DelNS1 LAIVs, and it will also be important to characterize the immune profile induced by DelNS1 LAIVs in humans. This study tested only monovalent DelNS1 vaccines, and further studies to evaluate multivalent vaccines consisting of combinations of DelNS1 live attenuated viruses are necessary. While cross protective activity was observed using individual DelNS1 H1N1, H3N2, and B LAIVs, it may be still necessary to test combinations of H1N1 and H3N2 LAIVs together with LAIVs representing either of the influenza B virus lineages to optimize cross protection against wild-type viruses.
