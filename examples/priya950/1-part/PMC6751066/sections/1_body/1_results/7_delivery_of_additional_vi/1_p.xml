<p>While CA4-DelNS1 (H1N1) immunization induced cross protective immunity against challenge with H7N9, H5N1, and HK68 (H3N2) influenza A viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">S3</xref>), no protection was observed when mice were challenged with influenza B virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>). This indicates that the cross protective immunity induced by CA4-DelNS1 (H1N1) LAIV is influenza A specific and does not extend to other types of influenza virus or to other viruses. Since NS1 is deleted from the viral genome in DelNS1 LAIV, there is an opportunity to express a new or additional antigen in its place. We tested this possibility by expressing the influenza B HA1 domain in the NS1 site of the CA4-DelNS1 LAIV genome to generate a chimeric virus, CA4-DelNS1-BHA1, expressing BHA1 from the CA4-DelNS1 (H1N1) backbone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Expression of influenza B virus HA1 was confirmed by Western blot analysis, and the genome of the chimeric CA4-DelNS1-BHA1 virus found to be stable during continuous passage in MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig. S7A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">B</xref>). Notably, full protection was observed when mice immunized with two doses of CA4-DelNS1-BHA1 virus were challenged with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted B/Brisbane/60/2008 virus, while all mice vaccinated with CA4-DelNS1 LAIV without B-HA1 died (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Using an H3N2 version, CA4-DelNS1-HK4801-BHA1 LAIV, 6 of 7 mice in the group immunized with vaccine expressing the influenza B HA1 antigen survived, while all mice immunized with one dose of vaccine without additional BHA1 died (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7D</xref>). These data highlight a novel strategy to improve the current influenza vaccine regime by using DelNS1 LAIV to express additional viral antigens and thereby broaden and enhance specific immunity to influenza viruses.
