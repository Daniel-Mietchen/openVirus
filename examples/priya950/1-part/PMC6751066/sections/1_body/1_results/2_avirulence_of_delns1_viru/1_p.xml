<p>It is essential for any vaccine to be nonpathogenic to humans. We examined replication of the CA4-DelNS1 virus generated in this study, comparing it with that of CA4-WT virus and the licensed cold-adapted H1N1 virus (ca-LAIV), which has different internal genes but has HA and NA similar to those of the CA4 virus. While CA4-WT and ca-LAIV replicated at both 33°C and 37°C in A549 cells, replication of CA4-DelNS1 was undetectable (

 <sup>6</sup> PFU of CA4-DelNS1, H7N9-DelNS1, or WSN-DelNS1 LAIV. Whereas mice inoculated with wild-type H7N9 (A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013) died within 1 week, none of the mice inoculated with any of the DelNS1 viruses died, and no symptoms of body weight loss or disease were observed in these mice (
