<p>To further evaluate the potential of DelNS1 LAIVs for use in influenza vaccine applications, we generated a DelNS1 influenza B virus using a master donor backbone from a Victoria lineage influenza B virus, B/Hong Kong/8038/2011. The NS1 coding region was deleted from the NS segment of B/Hong Kong/8038/2011, and a NS1-deleted version of influenza B virus was rescued using a reverse genetics protocol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>) as described above. A NS1-deleted version of B/Hong Kong/8038/2011 influenza B virus adapted to replicate in MDCK cells and embryonated chicken eggs was obtained using a similar approach, and the resultant virus was designated DelNS1-B8038. Sequence analysis identified five unique mutations that were present in the PA (T210C/Y61H), NA (T1429C/V459A), NP (C182T/P41L), and M (G88C/A22P and A280G/M86V) genes of the DelNS1-B8038 LAIV genome (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig. S5A</xref>). Analysis of growth properties found that DelNS1-B8038 influenza B virus replicates at 33°C in MDCK cells but exhibits reduced replication efficiency at 37°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>), similarly to CA4-DelNS1 influenza A viruses. DelNS1-B8038 LAIV cannot replicate in interferon-competent A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>). There are two genetically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses, namely, Victoria and Yamagata, cocirculating in humans. To assess if DelNS1-B8038, a Victoria lineage influenza B virus, provides protection from infection with both lineages of influenza B virus, mice were immunized once through the nasal route and were then (after 3 weeks) challenged with mouse-adapted influenza B virus of either the Yamagata (B/Florida/4/2006) or Victoria (B/Brisbane/60/2008) lineage (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Mice mock vaccinated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) died after 6 to 8 days, whereas all DelNS1-B8038 LAIV-immunized mice survived, with only minor body weight loss observed in the B/Florida/4/2008 (Yamagata) challenge group and no apparent disease symptoms or body weight loss observed in the B/Brisbane/60/2008 challenge group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Virus titers in lungs were significantly lower in DelNS1-B8038 LAIV-vaccinated mice than in the mice in the control group at day 3 postinfection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig. S5B</xref>). These results show that the DelNS1 B LAIV exhibits favorable cold adaptation and temperature restriction properties and is able to induce cross protective activity against antigenically distinct influenza B virus strains.
