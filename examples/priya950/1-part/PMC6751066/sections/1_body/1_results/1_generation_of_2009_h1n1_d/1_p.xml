<p>We previously identified a unique mutation (A14U) in the M segment which enhances replication of A/WSN/1933 and A/PR8/1934 H1N1 DelNS1 viruses in interferon-deficient cells (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Since the WSN and PR8 strains are no longer circulating among humans, we elected to use a relatively contemporary H1N1 strain to serve as the backbone for construction of DelNS1 vaccine strains. The 2009 H1N1 virus causes only mild disease in humans and has become one of the two prevalent seasonal influenza A viruses. We consider this to be an ideal virus from which to make a backbone for influenza A DelNS1 LAIV. Using technology similar to that previously described, a DelNS1 version of the A/CA/04/2009 (CA4) virus where the NS1 is removed but the NEP is preserved was constructed and deletion of the NS1 coding region from the NS segment verified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">B</xref>). The NS1-deleted version of the A/CA/04/2009 (H1N1) virus was rescued using a reverse genetics procedure and passaged in MDCK cells 10 times at 37°C and then a further 10 times at 30°C as previously described (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The resultant passage-adapted virus was designated CA4-DelNS1, and that name was used in subsequent experiments and throughout this report. Two adaptive mutations, located in the NP (D101N) and NEP (E95G) genes, were identified in the resulting growth-adapted CA4-DelNS1 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The requirement for both adaptive mutations for DelNS1 virus replication was investigated by constructing DelNS1 gene segments containing the mutations alone or in combination and examining the efficiency of reverse genetics virus rescue from plasmid transfection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The paired adaptive mutations promoted more efficient rescue than either mutation alone, and, interestingly, the efficiency of rescue at 33°C was higher than at 37°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Growth kinetics analysis showed that the stably growth-adapted CA4-DelNS1 virus had gained the ability to replicate comparably to the wild-type (WT) virus following more than 20 passages in MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). We then performed growth kinetics analysis of CA4-DelNS1 and the WT parent virus in MDCK cells and embryonated chicken eggs and found that DelNS1 virus replicated similarly to WT virus in MDCK cells and slightly less well than WT virus in eggs at 33°C, whereas DelNS1 replication efficiency was lower than that of WT virus in both culture systems at 37°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). The preference of CA4-DelNS1 viruses for replication at the lower temperature of 33°C, rather than 37°C, was entirely spontaneous and is a desirable feature in a live attenuated influenza virus vaccine. To further verify the contribution of the mutations in NP and NEP to growth and temperature adaptation, the growth kinetics of CA4-DelNS1 viruses carrying single or double mutations were examined, revealing that both mutations enhanced CA4-DelNS1 replication and facilitated cold adaptation in MDCK cells and embryonated chicken eggs, with the effect of NEP E95G being more apparent with respect to supporting CA4-DelNS1 virus growth (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref> in the supplemental material). These results show that the presence of adaptive mutations in the NP (D101N) and NEP (E95G) genes supported the replication of CA4-DelNS1 virus to levels nearly equal to those measured for the WT virus in MDCK cells and chicken eggs.
