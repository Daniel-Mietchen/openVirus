<p>Although NHPs have been used extensively to study MBFs, many of the potential vaccine and antiviral drugs that were successful in NHP preclinical research have failed in human clinical trials (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Other animal models, such as mice, have also been used as a low cost alternative to NHPs, and procedures exist to humanize mice to increase their susceptibility to infection. However, both mouse models and NHPs are still limited in their physiological relevance, and thus, results from these studies may not translate to human clinical studies. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> models have potential to overcome the limitations and ethical concerns associated with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal studies, but these methods also present unique challenges. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> models have been used in many MBF studies to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying infection and pathogenesis. However, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models that rely on cancer cell lines or monolayer cultures are limited in human relevance. Stem cell-derived models should be considered optimal human cell sources, together with primary human cell cultures and peripheral blood samples when possible, and GCCP should always be practiced (Coecke et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Pamies and Hartung, 
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In addition, novel cell culture systems, such as spheroids, organoids, microfluidic systems, and bioprinted multi-layered cultures that allow the study of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in a 3D 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> environment have demonstrated potential to increase the physiological relevance of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.
