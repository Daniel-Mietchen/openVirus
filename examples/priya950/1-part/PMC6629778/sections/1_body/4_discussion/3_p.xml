<p>Overall, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> methods have proven to be valuable resources in MBF research, to design and screen large libraries of potential antiviral and vaccine candidates as well as model host-pathogen interactions and study potential mechanisms of infection and transmission dynamics. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> models can play a major role in research on the prevention of MBF infection through vector control and provide a better understanding of MBF transmission factors and patterns that lead to widespread MBF outbreaks. In addition, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> modeling and high throughput screening of therapeutic or preventative drug candidates followed by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> validation has potential to speed up the process of MBF drug development.
