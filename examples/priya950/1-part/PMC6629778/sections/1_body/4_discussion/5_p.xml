<p>We envision a future of MBF research with less reliance on NHP and rodent models and an increase in the number and rigor of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies. The emergence of new technologies (e.g., induced pluripotent stem cell models, organotypic cultures, and high throughput 
 <italic>in silico</italic> screening) will help to better predict human pathogenesis and drug efficacy. We believe that harmonization of methods and centralization of data, together with combining different approaches to reach a common objective, are crucial to better understand MBF infection and neuropathogenesis and obtain clinical solutions.
