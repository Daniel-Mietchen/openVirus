<p>Small rodents, birds, medium-sized mammals, and non-human primates (NHPs) have been used in MBF research (Kimura et al., 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Goodfellow et al., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Maximova et al., 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). NHPs have traditionally been used to study human viruses because much of the host-specific pathophysiology is conserved between primates and humans. Protective efficacy of novel vaccines for MBFs has been demonstrated in primates for DENV (Guirakhoo et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), WNV (Petersen et al., 
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and ZIKV (Abbink et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), but their efficacy in humans still needs to be corroborated (Torresi et al., 
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Vannice et al., 
 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Primates also present maintenance challenges due to high cost and the strict requirements of high-containment biosafety facilities.
