<p>ZIKV, DENV, and WNV infection can lead to severe neurological problems. These include aseptic meningitis, febrile convulsions in children, encephalitis, and myelitis (Turtle et al., 
 <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Thus, models of the brain to study neuropathogenesis of MBF infection are needed. However, the brain is the most complex organ in the human body, and it is difficult to adequately model human neurophysiology. MBF neuropathogenesis has mainly been studied in monolayer cultures of various brain cell-type cancer cell lines, such as neuro-2a (de Borba et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ho et al., 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), neuronal N18 (Su et al., 
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Simanjuntak et al., 
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), primary cultures (Lucas et al., 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Diniz et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Yoon et al., 
 <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Zhu et al., 
 <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and stem cell derived CNS cells (Shrestha et al., 
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Retallack et al., 
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Yoon et al., 
 <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). For example, a monolayer culture of primary microglia, astrocytes, and neurons isolated from a fetal human brain was used to understand the replicative properties of WNV in each cell population. It was determined that WNV mainly replicates in neurons and astrocytes and that following infection, both astrocytes and microglia were activated and produced cytokines and chemokines (Cheeran et al.,
