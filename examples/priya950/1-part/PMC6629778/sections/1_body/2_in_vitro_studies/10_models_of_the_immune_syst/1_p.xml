<p>Sometimes, pathogens can compromise the BBB and enter the brain producing an inflammatory response, which typically involves the activation of microglia, the resident mononuclear phagocytes of the brain (Ginhoux et al., 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Microglia are responsible for the production of cytokines and other molecules that regulate inflammation and other homeostatic responses in brain, and these conditions can lead to brain diseases (Dheen et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). There are also other cells in the CNS that interact with the immune system such oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells, perivascular macrophages and some types of neurons. These cells produce cytokines and chemokines that interact with the immune system under inflammatory response.
