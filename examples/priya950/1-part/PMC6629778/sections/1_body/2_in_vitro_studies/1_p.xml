<p>Due to a need for more human relevant models to study the physiology and mechanisms of MBF infection, research on 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> methods has increased in the last decade. MBF research presents a series of unique challenges, such as human-specific pathology and a lack of adequate animal models. Thus, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> methods represent a valuable resource in this field. Research on 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models is also motivated by the search for more cost-effective drug screening methods that could be used to more efficiently screen compounds in drug development stages, with the added benefit of eliminating many of the ethical problems associated with the use of animals for research. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> methods still have limitations, such as lack of exhaustive reporting, low statistical power, and variability in reagents and protocols, and this has been summarized elsewhere along with Guidance for Good Cell Culture Practice (GCCP) for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> research (Coecke et al.,
