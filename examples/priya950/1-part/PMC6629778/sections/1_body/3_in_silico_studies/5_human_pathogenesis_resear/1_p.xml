<p>Although the majority of molecular mechanisms responsible for the neurotropism of MBF infection remain unknown, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> methods are emerging as promising tools to aid in the investigation of host-pathogen interactions that contribute to pathogenesis of MBF infection. An 
 <italic>in silico</italic> genetic screening approach was recently utilized to elucidate that ZIKV-elicited congenital microcephaly may act through dysregulation of the retinoic acid response element (RARE) (Kumar et al., 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis has been employed to investigate the role of both viral and human microRNA in congenital ZIKV microcephaly (Pylro et al., 
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
