<p>Overall, the recent computational studies on antiviral drug candidates demonstrate the potential of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> tools to aid in the rational design of antiflavivirals, identify pharmaceutically relevant drug targets, and accelerate the process of antiflaviviral drug development. A good example of such trend is the OpenZika project, in which components of a software system are shared among multiple sources (i.e., distribures computing) to screen potential anti-ZIKV compounds with increased efficiency, using publicly accessible data (Ekins et al., 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It demonstrates that there are many future opportunities to increase the scale, rate, and transparency with which new antivirals are identified in the future with 
 <italic>in silico</italic> tools. As timing is crucial in the development of therapies for emerging diseases, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> models that facilitate the prioritization of drug candidates prior to testing are particularly relevant to emerging flaviviral infections and establish 
 <italic>in silico</italic> methods as a valued resource in the development of antiviral therapies.
