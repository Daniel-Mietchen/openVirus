<p>Antiviral agents for MBF infection have generally been designed to inhibit viral entry, replication, or the host factors that permit viral infection. Thus, much of the computational virology literature on antiflaviviral drug development has focused on molecular modeling of the structures that play a role in these processes, such as the viral envelope, capsid, and enzymes, as well as the interacting host factors, in order to determine the optimal targets for drug development, screen compounds for potential antiviral activity, and identify the most promising therapeutic candidates for further testing.</p>
