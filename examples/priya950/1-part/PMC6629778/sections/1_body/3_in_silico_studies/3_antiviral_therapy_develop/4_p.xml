 <italic>In silico</italic> methods have also been used following 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> or 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> testing to elucidate the mode of action or binding site of particular antiviral candidates. For example, structure modeling was used to demonstrate that a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes DENV and WNV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse studies binds to the fusion loop peptide of the flavivirus envelope protein (Deng et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and to confirm 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence that an antiviral compound binds to and inhibits the DENV capsid protein (Scaturro et al., 
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Structure-activity relationships have also been used to identify the inhibitory functional groups of a DENV NS2B-NS3 protease inhibitor identified with cell culture experiments (Tomlinson and Watowich, 
 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and molecular modeling of antimalarial compounds was used to understand the stereo-electronic properties that allowed these compounds to also confer DENV antiviral activity in cell culture (Balasubramanian et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
