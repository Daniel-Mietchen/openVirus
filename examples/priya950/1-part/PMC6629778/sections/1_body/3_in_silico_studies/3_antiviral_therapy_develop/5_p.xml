<p>A number of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies on antiflavivirals have been used to inform further 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> testing. For example, molecular modeling of the protease-inhibitor complex of potential ZIKV antivirals was used to identify structural scaffolds for allosteric small-molecule inhibitors of the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease, and the most potent inhibitors were then tested both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> in human fetal neural progenitor cells and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice and found to demonstrate inhibition of ZIKV propagation (Shiryaev et al.,
