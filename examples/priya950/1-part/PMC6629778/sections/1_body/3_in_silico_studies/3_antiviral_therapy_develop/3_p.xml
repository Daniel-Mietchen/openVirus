<p>The structural proteins of the viral envelope are also important targets to explore in antiflaviviral drug discovery as a strategy to inhibit viral entry into host cells. Many studies have developed molecular docking approaches to screen compounds for their ability to bind to the viral envelope proteins of DENV (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Yennamalli et al., 
 <xref rid="B240" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Computational approaches have been used to build on naturally occurring DENV sequences, predicting novel peptide structures that display increased target binding affinity and improved inhibition of viral binding and entry while maintaining low host cell toxicity (Costin et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). More recently, a homology model of the ZIKV envelope protein was resolved, and a simulation-based approach was used to identify the binding sites of potential small molecule inhibitors (Fernando et al., 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). There are also host factors that play a role in viral infection and can be targeted in antiviral therapy. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> approaches have been used for virtual screening of small molecule inhibitors of the human helicase X-linked DEAD-box polypeptide 3 (DDX3), a protein which interacts with viral proteins and allows viral replication to occur within host cells (Fazi et al.,
