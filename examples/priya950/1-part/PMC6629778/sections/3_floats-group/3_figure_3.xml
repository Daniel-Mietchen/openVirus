  <p>Advanced cell culture technologies currently employed to develop 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> models of the brain and blood-brain barrier. In the diagram we summarize the main ways to generate 3D cultures, aggregating and multilayer technologies. Aggregation can be used to generate 3D cultures, for this gravity or shaking are used to form cell structures (normally spheric). Cells can also be plated to produce layers of different cell types to model tissues such as skin.
