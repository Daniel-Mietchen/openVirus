<p>Genotype, clade and strain replacements may impact DENV epidemiological profile by modulating viral replicative fitness [
 <xref rid="B15-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As DENV serotypes are not antigenically homogeneous [
 <xref rid="B16-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], it can also be hypothesized that infection with one genotype does not confer complete cross-protection against other genotypes. DENV-1 genotype replacement in 2012 [
 <xref rid="B2-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] may thus have contributed to DENV-1 serotypeâ€™s uninterrupted circulation over the last decade in NC.
