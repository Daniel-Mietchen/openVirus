<p>A better and more complete understanding of the peculiar epidemiological profile of arbovirus circulation in NC and its determinants can improve risk evaluation and public health planning before sizeable outbreaks. Although fragmented and incomplete, data collected over the last decade enabled a better description and understanding of this epidemiology. From these observations, we can conclude that predicting the occurrence of arbovirus outbreaks in NC relies on multiple factors. Measuring their interactions using mathematical models is of prime importance to identify new combinations of parameters to take into account when attempting to decipher the causes leading to an arbovirus outbreak. Modelling may help identify and understand the mechanisms that underlie the dynamics and evolution of arboviruses epidemiological profile in NC. Further, a deeper understanding of vector biology and population dynamics along with clinical and in vitro virological studies will generate highly informative data, to inform and strengthen these models. Finally, collecting more reliable data with higher spatial resolution on population immunity, vector densities, temperature/humidity oscillations, geolocalisation and time of casesâ€™ introduction, genetic evolution and replicative fitness of the arbovirus introduced in its human and mosquito hosts will provide valuable input to build robust predictive models.</p>
