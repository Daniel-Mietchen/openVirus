<p>In the past decade, arbovirus co-circulation has increasingly been detected in New Caledonia (NC), a French island territory located in the subtropical Pacific region with a population of approximately 280,000 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-04-00095-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). In countries where arboviruses are endemic, the complexity of ecosystems impedes the identification of the determinants of arbovirus circulation and their relative contribution. The insular nature of NC, the presence of only one known arbovirus vector (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>), the relatively low co-circulation of several arboviruses, the marked seasonality and the reliable epidemiological and entomological surveillance systems reduce this complexity, establishing NC as a simple and relevant ecosystem where these determinants and their interactions can be thoroughly analyzed. Here, we present the epidemiological, entomological, virological and climate data collected in NC over the last decade and how they inform arbovirusesâ€™ epidemiological profile. We also discuss the advantages of conducting studies on arboviruses dynamics in NC.
