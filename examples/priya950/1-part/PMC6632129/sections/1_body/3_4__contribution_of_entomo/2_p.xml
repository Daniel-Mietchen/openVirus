<p>Could outbreaks be determined by the ability of available vectors to transmit the virus? Vector competence studies showed that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from NC is competent for DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV. The Extrinsic Incubation Period, however, is three days for CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B5-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], seven days for DENV [
 <xref rid="B6-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and nine days for ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B7-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, transmission efficiencies at 14 days post-infection are 30% for CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B5-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], &lt;10% for DENV [
 <xref rid="B6-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and 5% for ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B7-tropicalmed-04-00095" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although transmission efficiency was highest for CHIKV, this virus never caused major outbreaks in NC.
