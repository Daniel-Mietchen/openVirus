<p>The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is still a major burden worldwide with approximately 36.9 million individuals infected with HIV globally (WHO). The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) set the 90/90/90 targets with the aim that by 2020 90% of all people living with HIV-1 know their status, 90% of these will be receiving antiretroviral therapy, and 90% of these will have an undetectable plasma viral load [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00482" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, this decline was only observed in Australian-born men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM), and an increase in new infections was observed in overseas-born MSM [
