<p>Virus subtype was determined and changes in subtype incidence were measured over time for NSW HIV-1 sequences sampled between 2004–2017 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7000). The proportion of non-B subtype sequences increased over time: Non-B subtypes comprised an average of 15% of all samples during 2004–2008, an average of 28% of all samples between 2009–2013, and 42% between 2014–2017 (
