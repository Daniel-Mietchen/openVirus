<p>In contrast, the proportion of sequences forming a new cluster increased initially from 15% in the 2011 sub-data set to 17% in the 2013 sub-data set, but then decreased again to 14% in the complete data set (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00482-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). This could simply be associated with an increase in the extent of sampling (HIV-1 testing). However, the number of new HIV notifications actually decreased in NSW from 332 in 2011, to 317 in 2016, and 313 notifications in 2017 [

Hence, while existing clades are growing more slowly, new clades are arising, such that public health interventions to stop virus transmission may be impacting on different populations unevenly. Indeed, epidemiological differences have been observed between HIV-1 positive individuals born in Australia, and those born overseas; for example a higher proportion of late diagnoses were observed in overseas born individuals [

However, from the 702 NSW CRF01_AE sequences used in this study, only 51% had available meta data including transmission risk and country of birth, so that no correlation between demographic factor and clade size and duration could be performed.
