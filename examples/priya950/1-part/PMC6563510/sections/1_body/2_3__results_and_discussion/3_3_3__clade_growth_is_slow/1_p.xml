<p>To assess the rate of clade growth, NSW sequences were split into four different data subsets according to their year of sampling and combined with the global sequences. The first sub-data set comprised of 149 NSW sequences sampled between 2004â€“2009. A wider time range was chosen in this case to enable a solid starting point for clade identification. Two additional sampling years were added for each subsequent sub-data set. NSW-specific clades were identified for each sub-data set. Clades where the most recent sequence was sampled before 2016 were classified as temporarily discontinued, although these may include more recent undiagnosed cases (11% of all HIV-1 infected people living in Australia are thought to be undiagnosed [

Notably, 34 clades were still active in 2017 (ongoing clades) and have been steadily growing over time, with an addition of one or two sequences for each two-year period. This includes larger clades found comprising more than ten sequences, and including the largest clade with 68 sequences, all of which represent independent sub-epidemics. This is consistent with a previous study showing that clades grow slowly and irregularly [
