<p>Virus sequences were available from 2004 onwards. Although sequence numbers were low in the first three years, they increased steadily between 2007 and 2017, with an average of 62 sequences available for each year after 2007 (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00482">Figure S1</xref>). For the complete data set including all 702 NSW sequences, a total of 109 NSW-specific clades were identified, comprising 463 sequences, representing 66% of all NSW sequences in this study. A total of 50% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 54) of these clades were sequence pairs, with no evidence of additional onwards transmission. However, 355 sequences fell within 55 clades characterized by three or more sequences, and were distributed as follows: 19 clades contained three sequences, nine clades contained four sequences, 13 clades containing five sequences, three clades contained six and eight sequences each, two clades contained nine and ten sequences each, and four clades contained more than 10 sequences, i.e., 14, 16, 19, and 68 sequences, respectively. This clade size pattern is typical for HIV-1 phylogenies, with the majority of clades being small (two sequences), and only a handful of larger clades representing sub-epidemics [
