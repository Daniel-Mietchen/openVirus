  <p>Sampling size changes over time. Number of sequences mapped across different years (bottom). New South Wales (NSW)-specific clade duration is shown by plotting the duration from the oldest to the most recent sequence sampled within a clade (top). Clades are colored according to clade size that represents the number of sequences within each clade.</p>
