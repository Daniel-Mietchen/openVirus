<p>Molecular phylogeography analysis of the origin and global evolution of CDV found that the probability of CDV first infecting domestic canids and then wildlife is higher than that for CDV infecting wildlife at first. Analyzing 208 sequences of the 
 <italic>H</italic> gene the study propose that CDV strains emerged in the United States during 1858–1913 and from there through migrations—perhaps pet trade-it expands to Europe, Asia, Africa and America. Thus, domestic canids are probably the main CDV reservoir worldwide [
