<p>These results show the importance of long-term research when studying CDV in free-ranging wild species in which virus detection and the recognition of clinical signs of disease (or their absence) is quite challenging [

 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For this reason integrated research incorporating the expertise of wildlife managers, behavioral and conservation biologists, veterinarians, virologists, and immunologists (among other scientific areas) and the inclusion of several wild and domestic species is needed for understanding the intricate epidemiological dynamics of CDV in multiple hosts. By monitoring CDV in target populations, regardless of whether clinical signs are observed or not, the complex scenarios of CDV transmission may be explored; including the possibility of the circulation of different strains that may vary in their virulence in different species [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], the existence of dead-end hosts—which are asymptomatic and do not shed the virus—such as the cat and pig [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] or perhaps either lions or hyenas when infected with CDV canid strains [
