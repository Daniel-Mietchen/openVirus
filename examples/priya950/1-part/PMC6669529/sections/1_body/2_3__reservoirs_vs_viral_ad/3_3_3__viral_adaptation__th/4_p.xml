<p>Virus adaptability to different environments can be viewed in terms of an adaptive landscape in which the peaks and valleys represent fitness estimates of the relative ability of the virus to enter and successfully replicate in an environment, such as different host species [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00582-f001">Figure 1</xref>) in which each peak represents the optimized viral fitness of a virus strain in a given host. These peaks are separated by a fitness gradient because mutations optimizing the ability of a viral strain to successfully infect a different host can reduce its fitness in the original host, a phenomenon known as antagonistic pleiotropy [
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. In this evolutionary scenario, viral genetic variation is studied in a coevolutionary framework to understand the degree to which hosts influence virus diversity.
