<p>A comprehensive comparative genetic study using several complete CDV genomes showed that all the residues found to be under positive selection in CDV are located within the H protein, which is the viral protein interacting directly with the SLAM receptor in immune cells [

It is hypothesized that even when a few substitutions are needed for successful cross-host infection, the likelihood of extinction of ‘partially-adapted’ viruses (i.e., those in the fitness valleys) should be high because their fitness is not optimal in either host and therefore would be out-competed by fitter strains (i.e., those at the fitness peaks) [

However, for CDV the results of fitness analyses to assess the impact of substitutions at site 549 for cell entry and viral replication in canid and non-canid hosts revealed an alternative scenario for the reconstruction of viral evolution when considering fitness trade-offs across hosts: the evolution of specialist and generalist traits [
