<p>The diverse examples shown above show that the transmission and epidemiology of CDV may be driven by three different mechanisms: (1) dissemination by means of animals with subclinical infection which can transmit virus; (2) in urban and peridomestic settings where wild animals come into direct contact with domestic animals which in this case would be considered reservoirs, and (3) strains that have adapted to a specific host mainly driven by the existence of specialist vs. generalist strains.</p>
