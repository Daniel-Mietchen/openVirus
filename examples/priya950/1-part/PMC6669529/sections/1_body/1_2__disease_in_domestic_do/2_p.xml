<p>For the development of the clinical disease, CDV infection has to go through two phases: first, there is an acute infection of the lymphatic system [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. CDV can also invade the central nervous system probably mediated by a putative third receptor called GliaR located in glial cells [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The clinical manifestations of CDV infection include depression, anorexia, nasal and ocular mucopurulent secretions, gastroenteritis, hyperkeratosis of the plantar pads and snout, and tooth enamel hypoplasia in puppies [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In addition, seizures, myoclonia with hyperesthesia, ataxia, paresis, and tremors indicate central nervous system involvement [
