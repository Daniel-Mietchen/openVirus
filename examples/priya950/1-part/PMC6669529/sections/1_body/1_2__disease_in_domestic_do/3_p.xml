<p>CDV infects multiple species within the order Carnivora, including domestic dogs (
 <italic>Canis lupus familiaris,</italic> family 
 <italic>Canidae</italic>), and various wild species within Canidae (hereafter referred to as canids) and other families such as 
 <italic>Felidae, Procyonidae, Mustelidae, Hyaenidae, Ursidae, and Viverridae</italic> (hereafter referred to as non-canids). Some studies have also reported CDV infection in other mammalian families, such as 
 <italic>Cricetidae</italic> (rodents), 
 <italic>Cercopithecidae</italic> (Old World monkeys), 
 <italic>Suidae</italic> (pigs), and 
 <italic>Elephantidae</italic> (elephants) (for a comprehensive review, see [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Furthermore, recently CDV was reported as the causative agent of the neurological signs observed on a captive southern tamandua (
 <italic>Tamandua tetradactyla,</italic> family 
 <italic>Myrmecophagidae</italic>, order Pilosa) in Brazil [
