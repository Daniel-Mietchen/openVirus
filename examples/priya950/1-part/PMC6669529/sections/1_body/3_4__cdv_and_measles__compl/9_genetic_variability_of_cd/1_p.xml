<p>As mentioned earlier, CDV protein H determines the cellular tropism and host range when interacting with the SLAM receptor in host lymphoid tissues [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and with nectin-4 in epithelial tissues [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Therefore, the 
 <italic>H</italic> gene has the highest variability and thus it has been widely used in genetic and phylogenetic analyses [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>,
 <xref rid="B127-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>].
