<p>With respect to CDV jump to humans, the literature reports that substitutions D540G and M548T in the protein H, besides Y267C in the protein V, C116Y in the protein F, and M267V in the phosphoprotein have allowed cell invasion in H358 cells (

 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. We point out that CDV complete genome sequences must be evaluated to identify other substitutions that can define its ability to jump between hosts, because most studies aimed to explain an adaptation process from a single component (protein H) ignoring the genetic changes in other regions that may contribute to the inter-species jump and adaptation.
