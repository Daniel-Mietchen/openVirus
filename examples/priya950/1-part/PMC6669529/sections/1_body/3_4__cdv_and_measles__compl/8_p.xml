<p>It is well known that experimental MeV vaccination in pups usually leads to an immune response with cross-reactive activity to CDV even in the presence of maternal antibodies [

 <xref rid="B122-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The produced antibodies recognize epitopes conserved between MeV and CDV thereby conferring a certain level of protection [

 <xref rid="B124-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that immunity against MeV may have protected humans against CDV infection or at least avoided the presentation of clinical signs [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. In non-human primate models infected with CDV and vaccinated against MeV, the antibodies generated in these animals partially cross-react against CDV protecting them from the clinical disease [

The possibility that MeV vaccination stops in the future in several geographical regions due to the success of the eradication program, allows us to think that the CDV can possibly jump the species barrier, infect humans and cause clinical disease in humans similar to that already reported in non-human primates [
