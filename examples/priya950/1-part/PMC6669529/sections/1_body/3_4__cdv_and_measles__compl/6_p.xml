<p>Naturally acquired and experimental inoculation of CDV in non-human primates have shown high neuropathogenicity potential in those animals with severe encephalitis [

 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], the authors showed that CDV was adapted to the two human receptors in H358 and Vero-human-SLAM cells by acquiring amino acid substitutions in the V/C, F and H proteins after 8 culture passages [

Taking together, these results allow to presume that, at least at the receptor level, humans are susceptible to CDV infection, however further studies must be done in order to establish if human cells could be also permissive to CDV replication [
