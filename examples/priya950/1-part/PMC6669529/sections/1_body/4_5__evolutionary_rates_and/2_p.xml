<p>The differences found in the tMRCA studies for CDV are ascribed both to the difference in the number of sequences evaluated in the different studies (from 35 to 208 sequences of the 
 <italic>H</italic> gene) and to the geographical and temporal diversity of those sequences. In this sense, it is important to note that the intervals intersect and that more reliable results will be obtained by including sequences with greater temporal and spatial divergence in the analysis. A time-measured Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree for the CDV 
 <italic>H</italic> gene is presented in the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00582-f003">Figure 3</xref> by using 69 CDV H sequences retrieved from Genbank.
