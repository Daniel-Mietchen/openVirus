  <p>Evolutionary model for cross-species transmission of canine distemper virus (CDV). In the model, each peak represents the optimized viral fitness in a given host species, and specific mutations (colored circles) are essential to reach this optimum in the new host. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The two fitness peaks of CDV are separated by a shallow fitness valley, thus few adaptive mutations are required. One mutation allows the infection of other species but also decreases the fitness in the donor species (light blue circle, generalist trait). Coevolution with the new species can select for further mutations that optimize the fitness (dark blue circle, specialist trait). (
   <bold>B</bold>) CDV infection in canids and non-canids as an example of the model presented in (
   <bold>A</bold>). A simplified phylogeny of the 
   <italic>H</italic> gene showing the relationships between CDV strains from canid and non-canid hosts, indicated at the tip of the tree as black and blue squares, respectively. The distribution of the amino acid site 549, which has been shown to be involved in CDV infection in non-canid hosts and is under positive selection, is mapped onto the branches of the tree. Commensurate with the coloring in panel (
   <bold>A</bold>), the substitution of site 549 is shown in light blue because it is considered a generalist trait that permits the infection of various non-canid species, but with lower fitness than the specialist trait in canids, marked in black.
