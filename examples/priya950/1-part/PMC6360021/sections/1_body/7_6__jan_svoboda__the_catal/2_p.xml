 <bold>Personal note:</bold> I first met Jan Svoboda in 1964 at the International Conference on Avian Tumor Viruses at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Another particularly memorable encounter was in 1981 on the occasion of a symposium held by the International Association for Comparative Research on Leukemia and Related Diseases in Los Angeles. Jan and his wife Karin visited my home in Pasadena, and we had a long discussion about the Prague spring and its armed suppression. After Prague was liberated from Soviet domination, I visited Jan several times. Our friendship was very cordial. Since I was born in Czechoslovakia and spent my childhood there, the historical rivalry between Czechs and Germans in Czechoslovakia could have divided us, but it never entered our relationship. We were aware of it, but for both of us, the common heritage was the precious bond that prevailed.
