<p>Avian retroviruses also remain potent pathogens in chickens, causing major losses in the poultry industry. A recent example is the outbreak of epidemics of hemangiomas and myelocytomas induced by subgroup J avian leukosis viruses in China. This subgroup of avian leukosis was first identified in 1991 in Britain [

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The evolution of avian leukosis viruses is continuing, and new envelope subgroups are likely to emerge [
