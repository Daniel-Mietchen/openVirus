<p>The finding of non-defectiveness in several strains of avian sarcoma virus changed the focus of the field. Non-defective avian sarcoma viruses carry all replicative and transforming functions on the same RNA molecule, allowing the molecular identification and characterization of these functions and their interactions. Since non-defectiveness is a unique attribute of avian sarcoma viruses and has not been observed with any other oncogene-carrying retrovirus, avian sarcoma viruses provided the only key to establishing the foundation of retrovirus genetics. In contrast, replication-defective oncogenic retroviruses can be propagated only with a helper virus, as two-virus systems, greatly complicating genetic analysis.</p>
