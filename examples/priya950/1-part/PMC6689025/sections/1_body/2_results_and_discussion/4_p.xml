<p id="Par23">To confirm that the viral inactivation was due to CAP treatment, we used control treatments that included H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, gas, or stirring. None of them had any effects on the PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> RNA degradation, for either the infected homogenate or the pure virus (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Moreover, in the infectivity assays, across all of the control treatments, only the highest H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment (25 mg/L) of the pure virus for 15 min effectively reduced the PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> infectivity. However, the same treatment did not affect the PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> infectivity in the infected homogenate (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This can be explained by either higher availability of the organic material (including viruses) in the infected homogenate with which the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> can interact or by the presence of the plant enzymes in the infected homogenate that can degrade the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (Zámocký et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>). The data for H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> as a control treatment confirm its implication in plasma-mediated virus inactivation. However, the greater PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> inactivation obtained with CAP, compared to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> alone, suggests that other plasma components are also involved in this CAP-mediated PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> inactivation.
