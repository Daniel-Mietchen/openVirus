<p id="Par21">Complete loss of virus infectivity (total inactivation) was achieved in 17 out of 18 CAP treatments (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Only one repeat of the infected homogenate treated by CAP for 5 min contained infective PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup>, which we detected in the upper non-inoculated leaves of the test plants. We detected PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> in all of the plants inoculated with the positive control samples, while we have seen no PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> infections for plants inoculated with the negative control (nutrient solution). Minimum time needed for inactivation of viruses in infected homogenate was 5 min, whereas only 1 min was needed for inactivation of pure virus both in high and low concentration. We speculated that difference in inactivation times originated from the amount of organic matter present in the infected homogenate, which can absorb the plasma irradiation and as such might ‘protect’ viruses from it i.e., viruses might become less accessible to the irradiation. The most obvious proof that CAP interacts with plant organic matter was a discoloration of samples in the first few minutes of treatments (Online Resource 4). Additional cause for the difference could be varied initial amount of virus in the samples, which was determined using RT-ddPCR. Concentrations of PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> in the infected homogenate ranged from 4.2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 6 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> RNA copies/µL of sample, while for the low and high concentration of pure virus, average determined concentrations were 3.6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 2.7 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> RNA copies/µL of sample, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
