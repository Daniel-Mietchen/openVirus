<p id="Par24">We confirmed this with the OES measurements (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) where we observed increased concentration of OH and O species that probably served as the precursors for production of different reactive oxygen species. Ar, O, and H atoms emission lines and OH emission system (A
 <sup>2</sup>Σ
 <sup>+</sup>–X
 <sup>2</sup>Π) were observed for all CAP treatments (Online Resource 5). The presence of OH emission system and Balmer H emission line in the OES spectra proves that water vapor is dissociated in the plasma. The intensities of spectral features did not change during the treatments, regardless of the sample type. A new spectral feature, N
 <sub>2</sub> emission bands, can be seen only in the OES spectrum of CAP in the air. These are present due to the diffusion of the ambient air into the plasma stream. The OH is also present in the free air CAP because of the humidity in the ambient air. However, the OH intensity is much smaller compared to the submerged CAP, thus indicating that the water from the samples is evaporated and dissociated in the plasma. We did not detect any response in the range between 200 and 300 nm, the wavelengths at which UV radiation damages nucleotides in different ways (USEPA 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>). That is why we concluded that UV radiation could not have any impact on the virus inactivation. This leaves reactive oxygen species as the crucial CAP components of viral inactivation, an argument supported by various research groups (reviewed in Guo et al.
