<p id="Par16">To examine the effects of different treatments on degradation of viral RNA, we first extracted the PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> RNA from samples. RNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen, Germany) was used for RNA extractions from infected homogenates according to the manufacturer`s instructions, with minor modifications, namely, without using mercaptoethanol. RNA extractions from the pure virus were carried out with QIAmp Viral RNA minikit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with minor modifications, namely, luciferase RNA (2 ng/sample) was added to the carrier RNA prior to extraction as an external control and the final elution step was performed with 45 µL of RNAse-free water. Sterile water was used as negative control of the extraction to monitor for potential contaminations during all extractions.
