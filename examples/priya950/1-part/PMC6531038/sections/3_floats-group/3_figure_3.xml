  <p>Axial CT (A), axial (B), and sagittal (C) T2-weighted MR images showing microcephaly and skull collapse. There is moderate ventricular dilatation, enlargement of extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid spaces and thinning of brain parenchyma. The gyral pattern is abnormally smooth for gestational age. Subcortical calcifications are predominantly located in the frontal lobes. Axial (D) and (E) T2-weighted, and coronal (F) T1-weighted follow-up MR images registered at 16-month-old showing the same pattern observed at birth.</p>
