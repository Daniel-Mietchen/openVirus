<p>The patient was followed-up as per protocol at approximately 1, 4, 9, 12, 18–21, and 24 months of age, by a multidisciplinary team. During the follow-up period she stayed in Barcelona, with no travel to arboviral-endemic areas. Her growth showed major restriction and at 24 months her weight was 8.5 kg (−2.5

 <italic>z</italic>-score) (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The patient never tested positive for any of the molecular biological tests or specific ZIKV-IgM. Her ZIKV-IgG response was monitored throughout follow-up, and seroreversion was first observed in May 2018 (at 21 months of age) being confirmed at 24 months of age (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, we could not perform a new lumbar puncture after seroreversion to check the ZIKV-IgG response in CSF because the mother declined this additional investigation. The mother remained positive for ZIKV-IgG and DENV-IgG in July 2018, when her daughter was 2 years old.
