<p>The diagnosis of viral infections usually relies on the detection of virus proteins or genetic material in clinical samples as well as the infected host's immune responses. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies cross the placenta, and serial serologic testing is required for the diagnosis of congenital infection when specific IgG is detected in the newborn. Transplacentally acquired maternal IgG usually becomes undetectable by 6 to 12 months of age, whereas infants with congenital infection show persistence of IgG antibodies. Before availability of molecular diagnosis, mother-to-child Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection was diagnosed based on persistence of the serological response beyond the age of 18 months.
