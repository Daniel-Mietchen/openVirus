<p>To our knowledge, this is the first description of a case of ZIKV congenital infection showing a non-permanent serological IgG response alongside the characteristic clinical phenotype. Furthermore, the location of this case in Europe and the absence of travel to endemic areas (thus no vectorial transmission risk) means that we have described the true serological response to prenatal ZIKV infection in early fetal life. We hypothesize that the following mechanisms could explain our findings. First, the low and transient ZIKV viremia, compared to reported DENV infections,

 </sup> could lead to a lack of ZIKV levels of antigen detection, and additionally to the absence of a strong immune response. Second, the specific and direct tropism of ZIKV for the central nervous system and other organs (i.e., female and male genital tract) may provide ZIKV with the ability to escape the immune system, becoming a silent virus for the host response. And finally, ZIKV may be able to avoid triggering a strong innate immune response, similar to what has been shown in some cases of pediatric HIV,

 </sup> because the active viral replication may have ceased during intrauterine life or soon afterwards. However, we do not know whether the same IgG dynamic is present in case of post-natal infection or reinfections, which could be very common in ZIKV endemic countries.
