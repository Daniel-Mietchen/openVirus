<p>There are important challenges for ZIKV laboratory diagnosis, partly due to the narrow time-frame for the detection of the ZIKV RNA. Additionally, the considerable antigenic homology between ZIKV and DENV can cause cross-reactivity in serological assays. In our case, we were unable to demonstrate ZIKV congenital infection by RT-PCR or ZIKV-IgM in postnatal samples. As inferred from other well-known congenital infections such as HIV and 
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, we initially interpreted the persistence of ZIKV-IgG in serum as the best serological marker to confirm congenital ZIKV infection due to the lack of evidence from other laboratory tests. However, seroreversion of ZIKV-IgG was first observed at 21 months of age, and then confirmed at 24 months (Table
