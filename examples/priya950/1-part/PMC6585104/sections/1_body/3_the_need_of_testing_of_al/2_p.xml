<p id="Par25">HEV was detected in 1 of 815 blood donations in Germany [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and is 100 times more prevalent compared with HIV, HCV and HBV combined. Risk estimations considering both, the HEV prevalence and clinical risk for immunocompromised patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] led to introduction of blood screening for HEV in the Netherlands and Germany. Analysing the cost-effectiveness of the screening of blood donations for HEV in the Netherlands, the authors came to the conclusion that preventing HEV transmission by screening of blood donations appears not excessively expensive compared to other blood screening measures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. However, since only a small number of HEV infections are due to blood transfusions, the overall impact on HEV disease burden will be small [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. To reduce de novo infections in general, several strategies have been proposed [
