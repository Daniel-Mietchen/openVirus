<p id="Par24">As mentioned above, several reports have described transfusion-transmitted HEV infections [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In one case, HEV transmission was associated with fatal hepatitis in a Japanese cancer patient [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. However, it is obvious that the risk of infection through meat consumption is much higher compared with transmission by blood transfusion. Screening blood donations will not prevent most cases of HEV transmission, but it will significantly reduce the risk for the transfusion recipients, which are either immunosuppressed and/or suffering from different diseases. In addition, there is a great difference between a person who takes up the virus orally and a person who gets infected intravenously. In the case of oral uptake there may be some protection by the acidic environment of the stomach and the mucosal barrier in the gut. Immunocompromised patients need often multiple transfusions, which increases the risk from transmission [
