<p id="Par26">It may be assumed that it may be sufficient to test only the blood donations for people at risk, e.g., immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients and recipients of haematopoietic stem cells. Such a limited testing seemed cost effective while protecting patients at major risk. However, there are several arguments for universal screening of all blood donations. First, the category “people at risk” is difficult to define due to individual variability. Cancer patients under chemotherapy, HIV infected individuals, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases under immunosuppressive treatment should also be included. The fatal outcome of a transfusion-transmitted infection of a cancer patient in Japan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Third, the handling of two separate types of blood donations would increase logistical cost and may even lead to product losses due to the stockpiling of tested and non-tested donations. For example, in the case more tested material is required, stored non-tested material will not be used and may expire and vice versa. Fourth, it may be very difficult or even impossible for a physician to assign a patient to an HEV risk in an emergency requiring transfusion.
