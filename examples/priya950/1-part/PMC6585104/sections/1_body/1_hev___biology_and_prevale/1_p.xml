<p id="Par16">HEV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus classified in the family 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The HEV particles present in feces and bile are nonenveloped, while those in circulating blood and culture supernatants are covered with a cellular membrane, similar to enveloped viruses and called quasi-enveloped [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are eight genotypes of HEV: HEV-1 and HEV-2 are primarily human viruses, whereas HEV-3 and HEV-4 were found in pigs, humans and other animals. HEV-5 and HEV-6 were described only in wild boars in Japan, HEV-7 was found in a dromedary camels and HEV-8 in Bactrian camels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. HEV-1 and HEV-2 are endemic in regions in Asia and Africa, the major source of infection is contaminated water (for review see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). HEV-3 and HEV-4 are zoonotic viruses transmitted to humans mainly by direct contact with pigs or eating undercooked pork. Seroprevalences of HEV-3 in domestic pigs were estimated between 5 and 100% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The detection of viral RNA and virus-specific antibodies depends significantly on the analysed pig material, the age of the animals and the detection methods (PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA and Western blot analysis) [
