<p id="Par27">HEV-contaminated food is the main source of HEV transmission to humans in Europe and other industrialised countries with moderate climate conditions. However, transmission by blood transfusion can be dangerous for the recipients considering their immunosuppressive status, underlying disease or other circumstances requiring blood transfusion. Several of the arguments discussed above in detail argue in favour of testing all blood donations for HEV-3 to prevent transmission. Based on these arguments, blood donor testing has been introduced in several industrialised countries, including recently Germany.</p>
