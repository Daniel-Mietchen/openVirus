<p id="Par18">Whereas oral-fecal transmission is the major way of HEV transmission in pigs, transmission via the placenta was also detected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Contact with pigs and the consumption of undercooked pork meat is the main way of transmission of HEV-3 to humans. HEV was also found in wild boars [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and screening of wild boar hunters, forest workers and pet pig holders gave good evidence that HEV is transmitted by contact with pigs and wild boars [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Many reports describe the detection of HEV RNA in pig liver, meat and meat products intended for human consumption (for review see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). In addition, HEV infections have been reported after consumption of shellfish and vegetables, obviously due to a contamination with pig manure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Transmission has also been reported after consumption of wild boar meat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].
