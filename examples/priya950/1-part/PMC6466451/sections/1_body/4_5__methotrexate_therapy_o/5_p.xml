<p>We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MTX in CCA [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00289" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Among 131 possibly relevant available studies, six met our evaluation criteria. Of these, four were retrospective studies, one was an uncontrolled prospective study, and one was an unblinded randomized clinical trial comparing MTX monotherapy to MTX combined with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine. Based on our review of published studies of MTX in CCA, we believe that (a) MTX treatment has been safe and (b) the evidence warrants high-quality randomized clinical trials of MTX in CCA [
