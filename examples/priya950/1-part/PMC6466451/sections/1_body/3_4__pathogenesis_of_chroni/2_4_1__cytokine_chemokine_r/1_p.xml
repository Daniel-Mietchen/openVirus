<p>In some studies, CCA is associated with high levels of circulating IL-6, GM-CSF, IFN-α, and IL-17 [

In addition to IL-6, CCA patients have other systemic markers of inflammation, such as the IFN-induced chemokines MIG/CXCL-9 and IP-10/CXCL-10, as well as proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-1RA, CCL-2/MCP-1, CCL-3/MIP-1a, CCL-4/MIP-1b, and IL-12 [
