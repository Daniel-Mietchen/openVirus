<p>Among reports of CCA patients whose disease mimics RA, the rates of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (CCP) positivity have varied widely. In an Indian study, 13 of 95 patients and 4 of 67 patients were respectively positive for RF and anti-CCP antibody [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00289" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We observed a patient who developed RA symptoms 3 months after CHIKF who was positive for both RF and anti-CCP antibody. In addition, this patient developed neutropenia and splenomegaly within 1 year after the onset of her arthritis, establishing the diagnosis of Felty’s syndrome [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00289" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There may be two different groups of chronic arthritis patients being reported—CCA patients who are negative for RF and anti-CCP antibody, and another group that are more frequently positive for RF and anti-CCP antibody and actually suffering from two diseases, CHIKF followed by new onset of RA.
