<p>We evaluated whether pre-existing rheumatic disease in our patients impacted the subsequent clinical expression of CCA and found that pre-existing rheumatic diseases could aggravate the pain in CCA patients. Similarly, among 159 cases of CHIK-CIR analyzed by Javelle et al. [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00289" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] observed osteoarthritis in 38 of 147 (26%) patients who were followed for 15 months. In a small study, Zeana [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00289" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reported preexisting rheumatic disease, including osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and lateral epicondylitis. Essackjee [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00289" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] found that among 173 patients followed for more than 2 years after CHIKV infection, 27 (15.6%) had some pre-existing musculoskeletal disease. In our cohort, the rate of pre-existing rheumatic disease was significant (22 of 50; 44%), but there was no relationship between these conditions and the clinical expression of CHIK arthritis or the response to treatment [
