<p>Other reports have also focused on CCA as an “RA mimic”. Among the 203 patients with CHIKF who developed joint pain, 36% (34/94) met the ACR/EULAR criteria for RA [

In a small cohort of 10 American relief workers who developed CHIKF in Haiti, 8 of 10 fulfilled the ACR/EULAR criteria for seronegative RA, presenting with morning stiffness and polyarthritis, especially in the hands, wrists, feet, and ankles [
