Arthralgia was polyarticular (&gt;4 joints) (76%) or oligoarticular (2â€“4 joints) (24%). Of the patients with arthritis, all 20 had hand involvement. Other joints with arthritis included wrists in 16 (32%), ankles in 12 (24%), and ankles and knees in 9 (18%) patients. Overall, both large and small joints of the upper and lower extremities were affected. Morning stiffness, low back pain, and neck pain were reported by 3 (6%), 8 (16%), and 3 (6%) patients, respectively. The ACR criteria for RA were met by 11 (22%) of the patients, and another 7 (14%) met the criteria for FM [
