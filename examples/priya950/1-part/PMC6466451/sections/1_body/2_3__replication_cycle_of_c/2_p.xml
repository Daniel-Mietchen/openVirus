<p>The latter process is triggered by the low pH environment in the endosome that induces conformational changes in the viral E1 and E2 glycoproteins. These conformational changes result in exposure of the E1 fusion loop, which inserts into the host membrane and promotes fusion of the viral envelope and endosomal membrane. The synthesis of viral RNA occurs in the replication complexes found in the bulb-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane, termed spherules, and includes the production of genomic positive-sense viral RNA, as well as a subgenomic positive-sense viral RNA, that encodes the structural polyprotein (capsid, E3, E2, 6K/TF, E1) from a negative-sense template. Following release of the capsid protein via autoproteolysis, the E1 and E2 glycoproteins are trafficked into the endoplasmic reticulum, transported through the Golgi, processed in the trans Golgi network, and finally transported to the plasma membrane where virus assembly and egress occur [
