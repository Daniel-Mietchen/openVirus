<p>CHIKV is highly cytopathic in human cell cultures, and the infected cells rapidly undergo apoptosis [

Alphavirus replication strongly affects the fundamental processes of cellular physiology, with inhibition of cell transcription and translation, and redirection of cellular resources for the synthesis of viral proteins and viral genomes [
