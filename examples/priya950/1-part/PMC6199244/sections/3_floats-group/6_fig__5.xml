   <bold>d</bold> The kinetics of replication of the 2016–2017win, 2017sum and 2014 H3N2 viruses at different temperatures were determined according to TCID
   <sub>50</sub>. 
   <bold>e</bold> Influenza virus replication in MDCK cells at different temperatures was examined by the hemagglutinin assay at 96 hpi. The 
   <italic>P</italic>-values were statistically analyzed by paired 
   <italic>t</italic> test. *
