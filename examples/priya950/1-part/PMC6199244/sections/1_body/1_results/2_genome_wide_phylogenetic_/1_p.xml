<p id="Par6">The gene sequences of all eight influenza virus gene segments were analyzed. Genetic analysis of the eight segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS) was performed for all of the samples and for vaccine strains isolated from the Northern Hemisphere between 2010 and 2018. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the 2017sum virus strains significantly differed from the 2016–2017win virus strains, and all of the 2017sum strains evolved from the 2016–2017win strains with several nucleotide alterations (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The phylogenetic trees exhibited similar topological structures, with the scale bar ranging from 0.002 to 0.001. The amino acid substitutions in the proteins encoded by these gene segments are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, including the proportion of each substitution. Most amino acid substitutions were observed in the HA1 subunit. Compared with the WHO-recommended vaccine strains for the 2016–2018 influenza seasons (A/Hong Kong/4801/ 2014), the 2017sum and 2016–2017win virus strains contained 11 amino acid substitutions (T114S, T131K, I140T, R142K, and R261Q in the 2016–2017win strains and K92R, T114S, N121K, T135K/N, N171K, D291E, and H311Q in the 2017sum strains). In addition, the amino acid substitutions between the 2017sum and 2016–2017win strains occurred at positions 220, 303, 329, and 339 in the NA protein; 127 in the NS1 protein; 668 in the PA protein; and 299 and 340 in the PB2 protein.
