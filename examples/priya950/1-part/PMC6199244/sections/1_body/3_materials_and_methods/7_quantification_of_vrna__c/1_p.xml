 </sup>. Unique tags consisting of an additional 18 to 20 nucleotides unrelated to the influenza virus were added to distinguish the three types of influenza RNAs (vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA). The resulting cDNA was amplified by quantitative PCR with an ABI Prism 7500 system (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies) using SYBR Green SuperMix (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China). The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table
