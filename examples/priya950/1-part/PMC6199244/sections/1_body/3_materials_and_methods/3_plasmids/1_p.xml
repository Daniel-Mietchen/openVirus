<p id="Par23">A/Sichuan/01/2009 (H1N1) virus (SC/09) cDNA in pBD vectors was kindly provided by Hualan Chen (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China), and the luciferase reporter plasmid pPolI-NP-luc was provided by Ke Xu (Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Shanghai, China). The H3N2 polymerases of the 2016â€“2017win and 2017sum strains were generated using plasmid-based reverse genetic techniques. The PB2, PB1, PA, and NS viral segments from these two viral strains were cloned into bidirectional pBD vectors. Mutations in PB2 (R229K, R340K) and PA (I668V) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis.</p>
