<p id="Par24">vRNA was extracted using an AxyPrep Body Fluid Viral DNA/RNA Miniprep Kit (Corning Life Sciences, New York, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Contaminant DNA was eliminated using DNase. Amplification of all eight influenza genome segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS) was performed using a HiScript II One Step RT-PCR Kit (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China) and a set of primers (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Amplification was performed under the following conditions: initial reverse transcription at 50 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. All of the PCR products were purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxy chain termination method using a TaqDyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle-Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequencing reactions were analyzed on an ABI 3730XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).
