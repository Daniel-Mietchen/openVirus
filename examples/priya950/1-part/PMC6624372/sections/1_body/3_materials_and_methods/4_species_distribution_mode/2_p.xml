<p id="Par28">The environmental variables that best predict the spatial distribution of HEV outbreaks were determined by their percentage contribution (PC) and the permutation importance (PI) as calculated by MaxEnt. In addition, the software also provides a jackknife test for the training and testing gain, and a plot showing the receiver operating curve (ROC) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Once a model was built using the complete list of uncorrelated environmental variables, we developed additional models selecting exclusively the 5 most-important ones given their PC, PI and jackknife results. The subsets of variables leading to the model with highest AUC scores were the selected for the final model. The model outputs were visualized using QGIS v2.18 (
