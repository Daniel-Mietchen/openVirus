<p id="Par3">HEV particles are small (approximately 27–34 nm in diameter), non-enveloped, and contain a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of 7.2 kilobases (kb). HEV is currently classified within the 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> family, and the 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic> genus and the 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus A</italic> species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Based on genetic analyses, human isolates of HEV are classified in four genotypes and several subtypes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 (HEV-1 and HEV-2, respectively) are responsible for the occurrence of large waterborne outbreaks in tropical and some subtropical regions

 </sup>. Specifically, HEV-1 has been detected in Asian countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam) as well as in Africa (Algeria, the Central African Republic, Chad, Djibouti, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Namibia, Egypt, and South Africa)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Genotype 2 was initially detected in an epidemic in Mexico
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, but more recently it has also been reported in African countries (Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Namibia, and Nigeria
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>). Conversely, HEV genotypes 3 and 4 (HEV-3 and HEV-4, respectively) do not cause outbreaks but have instead been identified as causative agents in sporadic acute hepatitis E cases in the United States, Europe, China and Japan, and are only associated with cases of zoonotic origin
