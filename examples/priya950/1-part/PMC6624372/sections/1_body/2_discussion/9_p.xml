<p id="Par21">A vaccine against HEV is commercially available in China since 2011 (Hecolin®, Xiamen Innovax Biotech Co., Ltd., China) and recommended for individuals at high risk of HEV infections. To date, it has not been licensed in any other country and no other experimental vaccine has progressed to clinical trials. We cannot comment on the possible effect of the vaccination of risk groups in China on the occurrence of HEV outbreaks in the country since currently little is known about the actual use of the Hecolin® vaccine
