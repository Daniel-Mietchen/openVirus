<p id="Par15">According to the general model, the main variables influencing the ecological suitability for HEV are: (i) the population density, (ii) the annual potential evapotranspiration, and at a lesser extent (iii) the precipitation seasonality. This indicates that the global occurrence of HEV-1 and HEV-2 outbreaks is associated both with the presence of the virusâ€™ host and hydrological factors, in agreement with the fact that HEV epidemics are primarily waterborne. These results are consistent with those obtained in previous studies showing that HEV waterborne outbreaks occurred during periods of drought or after extreme rainfall events

 </sup>. Combined, these findings may indicate that the occurrence of outbreaks is influenced by the concentration of the virus in water. Among other factors, pathogen concentration in surface water and their transmission may be in turn influenced by either evaporation of polluted water, or by runoff after heavy rainfall events
