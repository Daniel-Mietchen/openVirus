<p id="Par20">The dataset of HEV-1 and HEV-2 outbreaks used here is relatively small (59 entries) and the existence of geographical and temporal irregularities on the reporting and identification of HEV epidemics cannot be excluded. For example, changes in the sanitation level or population density in a certain region over the study period could certainly influence the occurrence of waterborne outbreaks and therefore change the general model obtained here. Similarly, it is a well-known fact that many waterborne diseases such as HEV are underreported due to the generally mild associated symptoms

 </sup>. Due to the lack of spatially continuous data, in our models we have not included other environmental factors that may also be important for the occurrence of HEV outbreaks (e.g. sanitation). In addition, the environmental variables included in as covariate in the analyses were selected given current knowledge on the environmental transmission of the virus, but it is also possible that covariates are missing, representing a further source of modelling error. Similarly, we have not taken into account the potential role of cross-immunity in the population due to co-infection with HEV-3 and HEV-4 circulating in the territory. Some authors have shown that Rhesus monkeys infected with genotype 1 or genotype 4 developed immunity to infections caused by the other genotype, suggesting the possibility of cross-protection between waterborne and foodborne HEV genotypes
