<p id="Par22">Despite its limitations, the present study represents a step forward for anticipating and preventing the occurrence of hepatitis E epidemics due to the contamination of drinking and recreational water with HEV genotypes 1 and 2. Our data will be useful to plan future prospective studies and may contribute to understand the movement of viruses between different geographical areas of diverse suitability levels. Data on the concentration of HEV in surface water, and the occurrence of HEV waterborne cases throughout the year should be obtained in order to establish the potential link between the HEV dose in the environment and the transmission of the virus among people.</p>
