<p id="Par19">In conclusion, we have identified geographical areas of high general and environmental suitability for the occurrence of waterborne outbreaks of hepatitis E virus (genotypes 1 and 2). Specifically, our results indicate that, at a global scale, the most ecologically suitable hotspots for these viruses are the Ganges Valley and Pakistan, the west coast of Saudi Arabia and subequatorial African countries. In addition, we have determined the most important factors (population density and water balance) for the spatial occurrence of HEV waterborne outbreaks at global scale, and for the seasonal occurrence of outbreaks at regional scale using the Ganges watershed as a case study. Nevertheless, our results have also shown that local particularities may also influence the onset of an outbreak, and thus further studies are necessary to better understand the role of other factors such as rainfall, soil properties, pollution source, land use or river network ephemerality acting at regional scale.</p>
