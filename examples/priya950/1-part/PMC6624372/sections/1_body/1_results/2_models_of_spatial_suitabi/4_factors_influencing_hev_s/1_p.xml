<p id="Par12">We developed a correlation analysis using average monthly data of environmental and hydrological parameters for the Ganges watershed over the year in order to determine what factors may influence the temporal occurrence of HEV waterborne outbreaks (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Our results indicate that while the number of cases/outbreak is not correlated to any of the variables included in the analyses, the actual number of outbreaks is negatively correlated with the Ganges discharge (r = −0.77).
