<p>While there was no cross-reactivity with the NS1 proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus or Zika virus derived from the supernatant from cells in culture, our future studies could include the analysis of patient sera infected with viruses other than DENV, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Zika virus, or West Nile virus. At present, there are no West Nile cases and only a few imported Zika cases in Taiwan. This is a limitation of our study. Moreover, our ELISA for DENV NS1 could be a tool to determine the number and identity of DENV serotypes during situations of DENV coinfection.</p>
