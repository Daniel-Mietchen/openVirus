<p>During the early period of infection (i.e., within the first 5 days), performing viral isolation and viral RNA detection testing which is capable of detecting and determining the type of dengue virus responsible for infection not only is expensive but also requires special equipment and trained personnel. Therefore, the accurate and prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients in regions with limited resources are difficult. Our ELISA for DENV NS1 is capable of detecting DENV NS1 antigens rapidly in the early stage and identifying the specific serotype of dengue virus that is responsible for the infection, thereby overcoming the limitations of current commercial NS1 diagnostic tests. We believe that our ELISA for DENV NS1 could be especially beneficial in regions where medical resources are limited and where multiple DENVs cocirculate. Moreover, this test can be easily incorporated into routine clinical diagnostic procedures to facilitate mass serotyping during emerging epidemics to identify patients at risk of severe dengue disease. Our ELISA could also be used in retrospective research to elucidate the distributions of various DENVs as well as the factors that contribute to severe dengue disease. Finally, the implementation of our ELISA for DENV NS1 could improve epidemiological surveillance, outbreak monitoring, clinical management, and knowledge of the circulating serotypes of this disease. The next step in this project involves the development of an immunochromatographic (ICT) rapid test for use in point-of-care testing to facilitate the prevention of severe dengue disease.</p>
