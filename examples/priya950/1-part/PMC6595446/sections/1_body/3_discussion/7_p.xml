<p>The severity of dengue disease is associated with the age and immune status of infected individuals as well as the presence of chronic comorbidities (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Infection with any serotype results in lifelong immunity to that serotype; however, the antibodies which are generated in response to one serotype only partially neutralize other serotypes. In fact, an initial DENV infection increases the likelihood that a second DENV infection with another serotype will develop into severe disease (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It is worth noting that the chance of a second DENV infection developing into severe dengue disease is also associated with the time interval between the two infections (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) and that some infection sequences are more likely to develop into a severe disease than other infection sequences (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Although cases in which the first infection develops into severe dengue disease have been recorded, these cases are rare. The second infection typically presents the greatest danger. Interestingly, a third or fourth DENV infection usually presents as only a mild or asymptomatic infection (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Nonetheless, in a number of regions around areas of endemicity, multiple types of dengue virus persist, increasing the risk and likelihood that individuals who live in or travel to these regions will develop severe dengue disease.
