<p>The significance of the results in our study are outlined in the following. (i) Our ELISA for DENV NS1 was sensitive, with the lowest detectable concentration of an individual soluble NS1 being 1 to 4â€‰ng/ml. (ii) The assay was specific, as our ELISA for DENV NS1 was able to discriminate the four dengue virus serotypes with no mutual cross-reactivity and no cross-reactivity with Japanese encephalitis virus or Zika virus (determined using supernatants of Vero cell cultures infected with DENV serotypes 1 to 4, JEV, and ZIKV). (iii) We evaluated the sensitivity and accuracy of our ELISA for DENV NS1 by applying it to clinical serum samples from 146 patients presenting with fever (66 patients with confirmed dengue viral infections and 80 patients with non-dengue viral infections). Our ELISA generated no false positives for any of the 80 samples from patients with non-dengue viral infections; i.e., the specificity was 100%. The overall detection rate of the test was 84.85%. With a comparison of the cases positive by the serotyping RT-PCR, the sensitivity of each type of ELISA was as follows: 88.2% (15/17), 94.7% (18/19), 75% (12/16), and 66.6% (6/9) for DENV1 to DENV4, respectively. In other words, our ELISA for DENV NS1 was able to identify the specific serotype of the dengue virus in samples from infected patients with a high degree of specificity and no cross-reactivity among serotypes. (iv) Five of the clinical samples examined in this study presented negative results when analyzed using the serotype RT-PCR test but were positive following analysis by the dengue IgM/IgG test and Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA kit. Our ELISA for DENV NS1 then determined that all five of these samples were positive for DENV2, even though dengue virus viremia may be lower in acute-phase serum samples; i.e., our system was still able to detect the low levels of NS1 antigen and correctly identify the serotype.</p>
