<p>Dengue fever can be caused by any one of four pathogenic serotypes (DENV serotype 1 [DENV1] to DENV4). Infection with any serotype results in lifelong immunity to that serotype; however, this immunity provides only short-term cross-protection against the other serotypes (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Furthermore, the antibodies generated during the first infection can increase the likelihood that a second infection (with another serotype) will develop into a severe disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome (
