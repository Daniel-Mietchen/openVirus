<p>The full details and methods of the process of development of our ELISA for DENV NS1 can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and in the supplemental material. Briefly, NS1 proteins were purified from cell culture supernatants of Vero cells infected with DENV1 Hawaii, DENV2 16681, DENV3 H87, and DENV4 H241 by immunoaffinity chromatography. BALB/c mice were initially immunized with immunoaffinity-purified NS1 proteins for the generation of hybridoma cells and the eventual selection of monoclonal antibodies against the four forms of NS1 protein. All experiments were performed using BALB/c mice purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center and maintained at the Institute of Preventive Medicineâ€™s animal housing facility. All animals were cared for in compliance with the guideline for the care and use of laboratory animals (2010, Taiwan, Republic of China), and experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or Panel of the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IACUC no. AN-104-12 and AN-105-05). Following a series of experiments for the selection of MAb pairs to assemble our ELISA for DENV NS1, the serotype-cross-reactive MAb that we named MAb53-1.1 was selected as the optimal capture antibody for pairing with four serotype-specific MAbs (named MAb12-4.1, MAb33-7.1, MAb43-1.3, and MAb22-1.5) as detection antibodies.
