<p>We performed the one-step SYBR green I real-time RT-PCR (QuantiTect SYBR green RT-PCR kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using four sets of serotype-specific primers in accordance with the methods previously described by Shu et al. (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This involved the extraction of RNA from 140-μl blood samples using a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR assays were performed in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μl of sample RNA, 12.5 μl of RT-PCR master mix, each of the primer pairs, and 0.25 μl QuantiTect RT mix. The thermal profile for the RT-PCRs consisted of a 30-min RT step at 50°C and a 15-min

Melting curve analysis included a denaturing step at 95°C for 1 min, a drop in temperature to 68°C for 30 s, and then a gradual increase in temperature from 68°C to 95°C at a rate of 0.1°C/s, during which the fluorescence was continuously read.
