<p>Each of the microplate wells was coated with 100 μl of 5 μg/ml of goat anti-human IgM (μ chain-specific) or anti-human IgG (γ chain-specific) antibodies in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (Na

After washing and blocking, the wells were incubated with 100 μl of 1:100-diluted serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)–Tween 20–1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)–5% normal rabbit serum and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. A cocktail (100 μl) containing pooled virus antigens (diluted to a concentration of 1:5) from the culture supernatant of Vero cells infected with DENV1 to DENV4 and MAb D56.3-alkaline phosphatase (1 μg/ml) was added to the wells, and the plate was allowed to stand at 37°C for 30 min. After a subsequent round of washing, enzyme activity was developed and the optical density (OD) at 405 nm (OD

 <sub>620</sub> was measured after a brief period of 30 min, in accordance with the methods previously described by Shu et al. (
