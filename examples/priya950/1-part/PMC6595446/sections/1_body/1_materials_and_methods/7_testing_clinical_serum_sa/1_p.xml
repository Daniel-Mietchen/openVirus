<p>Microwell plates were coated with 100 μl of 10-μg/ml MAb53-1.1 and incubated at 4°C overnight. The wells were subsequently blocked using blocking buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween, 5% skim milk), before undergoing incubation with 25 to 50 μl of serum diluted in blocking buffer at a 1:1 ratio at 37°C for 1 h. The plates were then washed four times using 0.05% PBS with Tween 20 and incubated with 100 μl of 0.8 μg/ml of serotype-specific MAb-HRP (MAb12-4.1, MAb33-7.1, MAb43-1.3, and MAb22-1.5) at 37°C for 1 h, before undergoing washing four additional times. Subsequent steps involved in the testing of clinical serum samples were in accordance with the methods described in the supplemental material (see “Development of Dengue-type NS1 ELISA”). Normal human serum samples (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) were used as a negative control. For each serotype, samples with values that exceeded the reference cutoff value (calculated as 2-fold the mean for the negative control) were considered positive by NS1 capture ELISA testing.</p>
