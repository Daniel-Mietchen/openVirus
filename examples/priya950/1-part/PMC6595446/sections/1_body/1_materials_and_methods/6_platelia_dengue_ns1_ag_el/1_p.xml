<p>DENV NS1 proteins were detected in clinical serum samples using the commercially available Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA kit (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, dilutions of positive-control, negative-control, calibration standard, and clinical samples were incubated in microwell plates with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated MAbs at 37°C for 90 min. After washing the plates six times, 160 μl of tetramethylbenzidine was added to each well, whereupon the plates were incubated at room temperature away from the light for 30 min. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of stop solution, and OD
 <sub>450</sub>/OD
 <sub>620</sub> measurements were obtained.
