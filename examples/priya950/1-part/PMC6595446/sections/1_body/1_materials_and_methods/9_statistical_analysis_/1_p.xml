<p>The sensitivity and specificity of serotyping by our ELISA for DENV NS1 were compared with those of serotyping by RT-PCR. The overall performances of our ELISA for DENV NS1 and the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA were compared with the results from the sum of serotyping by RT-PCR and the dengue virus-specific IgM/IgG capture ELISA. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both ELISAs were determined using GraphPad Prism (version 6.0) software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), with the significance level being set at a 
 <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05.
