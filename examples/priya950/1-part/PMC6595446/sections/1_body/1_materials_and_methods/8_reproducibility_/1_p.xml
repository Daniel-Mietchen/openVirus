<p>A total of 57 DENV-positive serum samples (16, 17, 16, and 8 serum samples positive for DENV1 to DENV4, respectively) and 50 negative serum samples were tested using our ELISA for DENV NS1 by a second operator on a different day. Note that the volume of the 39 serum samples was insufficient to allow for repeat testing.</p>
