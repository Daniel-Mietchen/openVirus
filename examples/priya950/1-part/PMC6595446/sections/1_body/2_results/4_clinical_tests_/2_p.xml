 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> illustrates the overall diagnostic performances of our ELISA for DENV NS1 method and the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA (of the 146 clinical serum samples, 66 serum samples were from patients with dengue viral infections and 80 serum samples were from patients with non-dengue viral infections). Our ELISA for DENV NS1 achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 93.15% (95% CI, 87.76 to 96.67%), with a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 95.49 to 100.0%), a sensitivity of 84.85% (95% CI, 73.9 to 92.49%), a positive predictive value of 100% (95% CI, 93.63% to 100%), and a negative predictive value of 88.89% (95% CI, 80.51 to 94.54%). In contrast, the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 92.47% (95% CI, 86.92 to 96.18%) with a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 95.49 to 100.00%) and a sensitivity of 83.33% (95% CI, 72.13 to 91.38%).
