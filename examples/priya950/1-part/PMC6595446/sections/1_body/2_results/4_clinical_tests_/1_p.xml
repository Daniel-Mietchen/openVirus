<p>We also evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of our ELISA for DENV NS1 using clinical serum samples. The analysis involved the collection of 146 clinical serum samples between 1 and 7â€‰days after the onset of illness. The samples were analyzed using a serotype-specific one-step SYBR green I real-time RT-PCR, the dengue virus-specific IgM/IgG capture ELISA, the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA, and our ELISA for DENV NS1. Following RT-PCR analysis, we found that 61 serum samples tested positive for DENV1 to DENV4 (17, 19, 16, and 9 serum samples were positive for DENV1 to DENV4, respectively;

Among the other serum samples, 5 that tested negative using RT-PCR went on to test positive following analysis with the dengue virus-specific IgM/IgG capture ELISA and the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA, and our ELISA for DENV NS1 method subsequently identified these to be positive for DENV2 infection (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). An additional 80 samples from non-dengue viral infections tested negative when using the serotyping RT-PCR, the dengue virus-specific IgM/IgG capture ELISA, and the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Among the 146 serum samples, 55 tested positive when the Platelia NS1 Ag ELISA was used, whereas our ELISA for DENV NS1 identified 56 positive samples (15, 23, 12, and 6 serum samples tested positive for DENV1 to DENV4, respectively; 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). By comparing these results with the ones obtained from the serotyping RT-PCR, the sensitivities of our ELISA for DENV NS1 were as follows: 88.2% (15/17), 94.7% (18/19), 75% (12/16), and 66.6% (6/9) for DENV1 to DENV4, respectively (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Importantly, none of our four ELISAs showed any indication of cross-reactivity to any serotype following analysis, indicating a serotype specificity of 100%. Furthermore, our ELISA for DENV NS1 correctly identified all 80 serum samples from patients with non-dengue viral infections to be negative (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our ELISA for DENV NS1 method for the detection of DENV NS1 and its ability to discriminate among serotypes of DENV in serum specimens, even during the acute phase of DENV infection, as early as day 1 after the onset of illness (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Despite the fact that the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA and our ELISA for DENV NS1 achieved similar sensitivities (55 and 56 positive serum samples, respectively), we believe that our NS1 ELISA system is superior because it is able to differentiate the dengue virus serotypes.
