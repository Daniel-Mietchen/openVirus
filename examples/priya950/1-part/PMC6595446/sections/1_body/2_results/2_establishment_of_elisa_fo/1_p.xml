<p>Our ELISA for DENV NS1 was established by identifying the optimal MAb combinations, and the various combinations were analyzed in terms of sensitivity (via serial dilution of supernatant from Vero cell cultures infected with DENVs) and specificity (ability to differentiate among the DENV serotypes). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, we selected four antibodies paired with MAb53-1.1 (a serotype-cross-reactive IgG2a heavy-chain MAb recognizing linear epitopes of the NS1 protein) that resulted in a high sensitivity and a high specificity to establish our ELISA for DENV NS1. The four MAbs presenting serotype-specific reactivity to DENVs that recognize the conformational epitopes of the NS1 protein were as follows: MAb12-4.1 for DENV1, MAb33-7.1 for DENV2, MAb43-1.3 for DENV3, and MAb22-1.5 for DENV4. The characteristics of the five MAbs used are listed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We also tested which of the five antibodies were best suited as capture or detection antibodies. In one test, MAb53-1.1 acted as the solid-phase immobilized capture antibody and the other four serotype-specific MAbs (MAb12-4.1, MAb33-7.1, MAb43-1.3, and MAb22-1.5) were used as detection antibodies (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">H</xref>). We subsequently selected MAb53-1.1 as the capture antibody and the serotype-specific antibodies MAb12-4.1, MAb33-7.1, MAb43-1.3, and MAb22-1.5 as the detection antibodies. We also determined that the optimal concentrations for the capture MAb and detection MAb were 1 μg/well and 0.08 μg/well, respectively.
