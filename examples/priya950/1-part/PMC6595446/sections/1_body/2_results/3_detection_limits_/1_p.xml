<p>To determine the baseline detection limits of our ELISA for DENV NS1, we performed 2-fold serial dilutions of immunoaffinity-purified DENV NS1 proteins using blocking buffer, in which bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to establish baselines for the assay. Samples with OD
 <sub>450</sub> values at least double the OD
 <sub>450</sub> of BSA were considered positive. Under this criterion, the linear portion of the standard curves of the four dengue virus serotype-specific ELISAs ranged from 3.906 to 125 ng/ml (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The minimum detection levels of our ELISA for DENV NS1 were determined to be between 1 and 4 ng/ml, depending on the assay (sensitivities for DENV1 to DENV4 detection were, respectively, 1.953 ng/ml, 3.906 ng/ml, 3.906 ng/ml, and 0.977 ng/ml;

In contrast, the minimum detection levels achieved by the commercial Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA, which were determined at the same time using the same four purified NS1 proteins, were 3.906 ng/ml, 31.250 ng/ml, 0.977 ng/ml, and 7.813 ng/ml for DENV1 to DENV4, respectively (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This clearly demonstrates the superiority of our ELISA for the detection of DENV NS1 in terms of sensitivity.
