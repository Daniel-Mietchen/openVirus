<p>Clinical serum samples were retested with our ELISA for DENV NS1 by a second operator on a different day. The tests were performed using the original serum samples. Specifically, we tested a total of 57 samples that were positive for DENV (16, 17, 16, and 8 samples positive for DENV1 to DENV4, respectively) and 50 samples that were negative for DENV. The results from this second round of testing (107 serum samples; 39 samples could not be retested due to insufficient volumes of serum) were 100% consistent with those of the initial testing for DENV1 to DENV4, and all 50 negative serum samples again produced a negative result, thereby illustrating the reproducibility of our ELISA for DENV NS1.</p>
