<p>This systematic review found only five studies meeting pre-specified eligibility criteria, and while no meta-analysis was possible with study data published “as-is”, we were able to undertake a unique pooled analysis of the two NHP studies by publishing here extended data from McCracken et al [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007060.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Between this NHP pooled analysis and qualitative review of two of the three eligible human studies we have identified data suggesting that prior DENV infection may lead to greater ZIKV viremia compared to those without prior DENV infection in both humans and NHPs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007060.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007060.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, this difference in magnitude is neither statistically significant nor of a magnitude which is likely to be clinically significant, so caution is required in interpreting these findings. Indeed, three eligible human studies did not indicate an increased risk of either adverse fetal outcomes, GBS or a composite “clinical severity score” in those with ZIKV infections who had previously been infected with DENV, when compared to those acute ZIKV infections with no prior DENV infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007060.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, Terzian et al did not show a statistically significant increase in inflammatory cytokines associated with the trend toward higher median ZIKV viral loads in DENV IgG+ individuals [
