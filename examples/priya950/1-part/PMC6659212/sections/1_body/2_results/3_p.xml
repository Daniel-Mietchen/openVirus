<p id="Par24">In our positive control (
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> PAEA strain), infection was detected at 7 dpe for both ZIKV strains tested by RT-qPCR and cytopathic effect while dissemination and transmission were only found for the Suriname ZIKV strain at 14 and 21 dpe (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The transmission efficiency (TE) of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> for the Suriname ZIKV strain based on the cytopathic effect in Vero cells was 15% (3/20) and 5% (1/20) at 14 and 21 dpe, respectively.
