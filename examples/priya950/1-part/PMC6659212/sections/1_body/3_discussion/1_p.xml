<p id="Par25">The present study demonstrates that the assessed population of 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic> from Catalonia was unable to transmit the Suriname and MR766 ZIKV strains, belonging to the Asian and African I phylogenetic lineages, respectively. Our results indicate that the 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic> population has a strong midgut escape barrier (MEB) since at 7 dpe we found infected bodies of MR766 ZIKV strain by RT-qPCR as well as at 14 and 21 dpe to the ZIKV Asian strain but neither the disseminated infection nor the transmission were detected at any of the time points analyzed. These findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that the MEB can limit virus dissemination from the midgut to the hemocoel or secondary organs as reported for other arbovirus-mosquito species combinations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As the viral load detected by RT-qPCR was low in infected bodies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), we suggest that the virus is replicating at a very low level. Therefore, the virus would not be able to cross the MEB and disseminate through the mosquito hemocoel to reach the salivary glands making it unable to transmit the virus. In addition, these results are in accordance with a recent study in which another 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic> population was assayed for a ZIKV strain of the Asian lineage (Puerto Rico, 2015) under constant environmental conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It should be noted that in our experiment, apart from testing a ZIKV strain of Asian lineage, we also assayed a ZIKV strain of the African I lineage (MR766) with cycled environmental conditions (26/22 °C day/night). Both studies indicate that despite the anthropophilic behavior of 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic>, its role in the transmission of ZIKV seems unlikely.
