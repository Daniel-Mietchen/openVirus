<p>To study the geographic spread of RYMV in continuous space and to quantify its tempo and dispersal, we fitted separate continuous phylogenetic diffusion models to the Madagascar, East and West African datasets, modeling the change in coordinates (latitude and longitude) along each branch in the evolutionary history as a bivariate normal random deviate (

As an alternative to homogeneous Brownian motion, we adopted a relaxed random walk (RRW) extension that models branch-specific variation in dispersal rates by independently drawing branch-specific rate scalers of the RRW precision matrix from a Cauchy distribution to relax the assumption of a constant precision (= 1/variance) among branches (

Bayesian inference using continuous diffusion models yield a posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees, each having ancestral nodes annotated with location estimates. We summarized several dispersal statistics from the posterior estimates of the continuous phylogenetic diffusion process (

The dispersal statistics were summarized across successive time periods. In addition to dispersal rates, we also visualized the epidemic wavefront as the largest great-circle distance traveled from the root location.
