<p>Madagascar is the fifth largest island in the world. It covers 600,000 km
 <sup>2</sup>, stretches 1,500 km from south to north, 500 km from east to west, and is isolated from mainland Africa by the Mozambique canal that is at least 400 km wide. The landscape is divided into three zones: a high-altitude plateau (1,000–2,500 m) forms a south-to-north barrier between the wide plains at the west and a narrow coastal zone at the east. The island has several climatic zones, tropical humid at the east, tropical savanna at the north-west, warm semi-arid at the south and south-west, and a subtropical oceanic highland climate in the high plateau of the center of the country (

It occupies nearly half of the total cultivated area. Rice is grown in six zones: the north, north-west, and central-western regions, the central part of the Malagasy highlands, the east, and the central-eastern part including the Lake Alaotra basin with its swampy areas, plains, and valleys suited for rice. Rice is also cultivated to a smaller extent in the south of the country. There are four main rice cultivation modes in Madagascar: irrigated rice, rainfed lowland rice, rainfed upland rice, and rice as a first crop after slash and burn. In ratio of cultivated area, irrigated rice is the most important, covering 82 per cent of all area under rice in 2008. About 60 per cent of irrigated rice is transplanted.
