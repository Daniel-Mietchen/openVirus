<p>In 
 <xref rid="vez023-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, we compare the weighted average dispersal velocity of RYMV in mainland Africa and Madagascar epidemics. Over the time frame of the Madagascar epidemic (the 1983–2017 period, i.e. a 35-year-long time slice), the lineage dispersal velocity is similar in Madagascar and East Africa (ca. 14–15 km/year) and somewhat lower in West Africa (ca. 11 km/year) although the uncertainty on the estimates overlaps substantially. At earlier 35-year-long time slices, the lineage dispersal velocity in Madagascar was higher than that of the East Africa epidemic. The mean estimates show a similar trend for West Africa, but the large uncertainty that overlaps with that for the Madagascar estimate prevents us from drawing any firm conclusions about these differences. A plot of the epidemic wavefront over time shows that the slope is comparable among the three epidemics in the three decades before the wavefront reaches its plateau (
