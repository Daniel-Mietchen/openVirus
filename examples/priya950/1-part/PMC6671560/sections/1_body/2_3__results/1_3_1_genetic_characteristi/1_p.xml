<p>We first identified where in the genome recombination occurred, and which were the likely strains involved, by plotting the genetic distance between sequences as a function of the position in the genome. Such similarity plots, implemented in SIMPLOT, were made for the full genome of the six Malagasy isolates with representative isolates of the other S4 strains and of the S5 sister-strain. As the results were consistent among the six isolates from Madagascar, they are illustrated for only a single isolate (isolate Mg15) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This identifies three putative recombination events that were also detected by at least five of the seven recombinant detection methods implemented in RDP. A ML phylogenetic tree from each of the four fragments was reconstructed using PHYML (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F2">Fig. 2</xref>), and in fragment IV—which includes the ORF4—the S4-Mg isolates are nested within the S4-Ug strain. In contrast, in region I the S4-Mg isolates are most closely related to the S4-Et strain.
