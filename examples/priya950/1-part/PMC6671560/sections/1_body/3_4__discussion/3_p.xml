<p>RYMV in Madagascar presents an opportunity to study the spread of a plant virus after a single and relatively recent introduction in a large country with a heterogeneous host ecology and landscape. The field surveys and the phylogeographic reconstructions converge on a picture of a regular and rapid southward invasion of the epidemic throughout Madagascar within three to four decades. The most notable difference between the reconstructions of the epidemic lies in the early stages as the presence of the disease in the 1970s in the very north of Madagascar reported by farmers is not captured by our sample of the epidemic. As our sequence dataset contains only a limited number of isolates from this region, it remains difficult to distinguish between the scenario where the initial isolates from the north of Madagascar have no surviving progeny, or that their descendants were not sampled. In addition, the phylogeographic reconstructions capture a re-invasion of the north regions that is difficult to distinguish from ongoing local transmission by traditional surveillance methods. The fast dissemination of RYMV in Madagascar underlines the risk of a rapid diffusion of virulent pathotypes. For instance, isolates which readily overcome the

With a dispersal of around 15 km/year, these virulent isolates can rapidly become, everywhere in the country, a threat to rice cultivation with varieties harboring this resistance genotype. Such risks should be considered in the design of RYMV control strategies (
