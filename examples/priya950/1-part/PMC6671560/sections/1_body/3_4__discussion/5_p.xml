<p>The factors impacting the dispersal rate of RYMV throughout Madagascar were tested using a landscape phylogeographic approach (

 <xref rid="vez023-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dellicour et al. 2016</xref>) similar to that recently applied to RYMV in mainland Africa (
 <xref rid="vez023-B17" ref-type="bibr">Dellicour et al. 2018b</xref>). Rice density, elevation, mean temperature, and annual precipitation are epidemiologically relevant and consequently of particular interest to test. For instance, absence of the disease in the very south of the country may link to the low rice density that restricts the possibilities of propagation. Sporadic presence of RYMV in the high-altitude plateau may be due to the lower temperature that is unfavorable to the virus vectors. Limited movements from west to east may be the consequence of elevation made by the high-altitude plateau that forms a physical barrier crossing the country from south to north. Yet, none of these factors were found to significantly impact the lineage dispersal velocity. This does not necessarily mean that they do not impact virus spread. For instance, if several of these factors interacted and concomitantly shaped the dispersal, their coordinated effect would not be identified in the seraphim analyses because only independent factors can be tested. Nonlinear relationships, such as between the spread and temperature because of detrimental effects of too low or too high values, may also be difficult to detect. Only linear relationships are investigated in the present study because of the lack of prior information on alternative relationships to test.
