<p>This study provides an example of data integration in viral phylodynamics (
 <xref rid="vez023-B6" ref-type="bibr">Baele etÂ al. 2017</xref>), applied to a plant pathogen. The temporal signal in the sequence dataset of isolates from Madagascar was not sufficient to obtain a reliable estimate of the substitution rate although it included isolates collected over a 30-year-long period. However, a flexible partition model which shared the temporal information among several geographical partitions, yet allowing independent estimates of the other parameters, circumvented this difficulty. This enabled us to perform a phylogeographic reconstruction despite the low genetic diversity of the S4-Mg strain. Increasing the sequence length as an alternative way will not necessarily increase the temporal signal as recombination events now known to be frequent for RYMV may hamper the recovery of the clock signal. Increasing the sampling density may increase the spatial information and the temporal information. However, as illustrated by our study, it cannot account for extinct or displaced lineages which may be frequent in RYMV epidemiology because of the narrow host range of the virus. Using information from field surveys provided complementary spatial and temporal information on the early stages of the epidemic not accessible through genetic data. This study highlights the value and complementarity of (historical) nongenetic and (more contemporaneous) genetic surveillance data for reconstructing the history of spread of plant viruses. In conclusion, despite differences in strain characteristics, vector species, transmission means, landscape ecology, agro-climatic environments, and spatial scales, the virus dispersal processes across Madagascar and continental Africa are consistent.
