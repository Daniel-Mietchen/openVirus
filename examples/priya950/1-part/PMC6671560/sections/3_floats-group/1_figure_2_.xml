 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenies estimated from genomic fragments I to IV (see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>) of the thirty complete sequences of isolates representative of the RYMV strains of East Africa and Madagascar. The trees were midpoint rooted, and numbers next to branches indicate their support based on the aLRT test. Tips are colored by strain, with color-strain correspondence as in the legend. The scale bar is in units of substitutions per site.
