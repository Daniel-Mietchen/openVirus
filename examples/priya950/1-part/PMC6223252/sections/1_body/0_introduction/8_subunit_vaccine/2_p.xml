 </xref> , antiserum was produced in mice against overlapping synthetic peptides elicited by the VP1 capsid protein of EV-A71. Peptides SP55 (amino acids 163-177 of VP1) and SP70 (amino acids 208-222 of VP1) could elicit neutralizing antibodies against EV-A71 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> . SP70 was identified as particularly potent in eliciting a neutralizing antibody titer compared to that obtained with whole virion-immune serum. The amino acid residues of epitope SP70 are more conserved than the VP1 sequences of various subgenogroups of EV-A71. However, obtaining superior synthetic antigens requires the use of more effective adjuvants. Although the yeast-expressed VP1 protein provides good immunogenicity, VP1 subunit vaccines require further refinement to contribute significantly to an effective vaccine strategy
