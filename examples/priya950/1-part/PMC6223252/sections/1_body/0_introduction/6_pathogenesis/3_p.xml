 </xref> , a total of 46 children with EV-A71-related brainstem encephalitis (EBE) were enrolled and subsequently underwent 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) examinations of the brain. Among these 46 children, 35 had MR images evidencing dorsal medulla oblongata involvement, 32 had evidence of pons involvement, 10 had evidence of midbrain involvement and 7 had evidence of dentate nucleus involvement. Patients with dorsal medulla oblongata involvement or multiple areas involvement were significantly more likely to have poorer outcomes than patients without these features.
