 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>16</sup>
 </xref> . Four distinct subgenogroups (B3, B4, C1 and C2) were found to have been cocirculating in the Asia-Pacific region from 1990-2016. Subgenogroup C4, particularly the C4a lineage, has also emerged in the Asia-Pacific region. The evolutionary branch C4a has crucial nucleotides and amino acid mutations relative to the branch C4b, and these changes may be the primary reason for its increased neurovirulence, causing outbreaks in China
