 </xref> , the B4 vaccine poorly neutralizes an atypical C2 strain. In addition, no formalin-inactivated EV-A71 vaccines developed to date protect against CV-A16, which is a primary cause of annual HFMD outbreaks. Additionally, the humoral immunity associated with protection initially observed, appears to wane after the first 6 months of vaccination. However, inactivated EV-A71 vaccines have significant safety advantages over live-attenuated ones because of their inability to replicate.
