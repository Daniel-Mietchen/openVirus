  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of BLV 
   <italic>env</italic> 423-bp nucleotide sequences from China and other countries. The phylogenetic tree was made using the maximum likelihood method. The ten known major genotypes are labeled G1 to G10. The new G11 and G6E are indicated as red circles and blue circles, respectively. HLJ BLV isolates were clustered into three genotypes, G1, G6, and G11
