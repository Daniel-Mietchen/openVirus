    <bold>Figure S1.</bold> Deduced amino acid alignment of G11 E101 and E102 with current known G1 to G10 isolates. E101- and E102-deduced amino acids were aligned with those of 10 known genotypes. The variation sites T (131), D (133), R (135), and A140 together (located in the ND2 domain and ZB) were highly specific in G11 E101 and E102 but not in isolates of other genotypes. (PPTX 353 kb)
