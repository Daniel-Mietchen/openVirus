<p id="Par12">The BLV provirus has approximately 8200 base pairs, which encode four major structural and enzymatic proteins (Gag, Pro, Pol, and Env), two regulatory proteins (Tax and Rex), and two accessory proteins (R3 and G4) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Other than these viral genes, the BLV provirus also contains a microRNA-encoding region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The Gag protein can be cleaved into three parts, termed the matrix protein (MA, p15), the capsid protein (CA, p24), and the nucleocapsid protein (NC, p12) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The Env protein is expressed as a precursor gpr72, which is processed into surface (SU) gp51 and transmembrane (TM) gp30 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Based on the env gene polymorphism in the gp51 region, BLV is now classified into 10 genotypes (genotype 1 to genotype 10, G1–G10), which are distributed worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. BLV genotypes have been reported in countries near China, such as the Philippines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], Korea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and Mongolia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Recently, BLV infection of cattle in China was investigated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another study reported the genotype prevalence in yaks of southwestern China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, the BLV genotypes of cattle in other parts of China are still unknown. Heilongjiang Province (HLJ), northeastern China, as one of the largest provinces in the territory, has a strong husbandry industry. HLJ ranks 4th among Chinese provinces with the most dairy cattle (more than 200,000), according to information released by the Dairy Data Center of China (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Nevertheless, the current status of BLV epidemics in HLJ is unclear, and the BLV genotypes circulating in this region still need to be identified.
