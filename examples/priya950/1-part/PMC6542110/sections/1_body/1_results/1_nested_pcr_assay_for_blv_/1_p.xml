<p id="Par14">Our nested PCR results showed that BLV epidemics existed in the regions of SH, DQ, HRB, and JX, whereas the status varied somewhat among these regions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). JX had the highest infection rate of 31%. DQ, HRB, and SH are in close proximity with each other, and the infection rates among these regions were similar, with infection rates of 10, 8, and 5%, respectively. Notably, the conventional nested PCR identified an infection rate of 10% in DQ, whereas the CoCoMo-qPCR-2 detection showed more sensitivity with 12.5% infection. No BLV provirus DNA was detected in samples from QQHR and MDJ. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, QQHR is adjacent to DQ, whereas MDJ is geographically near JX. Although a relatively high BLV infection rate was found in JX and DQ, no BLV infection was detected in QQHR and MDJ, which might suggest strict local management of dairy cattle in both QQHR and MDJ. Taken together, these results indicate a common BLV infection in partial regions of HLJ.
