<p id="Par18">Based on the nested PCR results, we further acquired the gag genes from several BLV-positive samples. As shown in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, 14 substitution sites in the Gag region were found in our local strains and aligned with the G1 strain (GenBank accession# EF600696, one FLK-BLV subclone). Substitution sites were distributed in the following regions: seven in the MA region, including residues 35, 48, 63, 69, 87, 88, and 90; five in the CA region, consisting of residues 164, 171, 315, 318, and 323; and two in the NC region, including residues 329 and 365. The alignment of Gag in the listed strains showed that the MA region displayed a relatively high ratio of variation, and variations in the CA region were not prone to occur. This case should be partially attributed to the dependence on CA to maintain viral core stability. Unlike BLV gp51, no N-linked glucosylation sites were found in our acquired Gag region.
