<p id="Par27">Both the BLV env and gag nucleotide sequences were edited using the Lasergene DNAStar program 6.0 (DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA). The Megalign program was used to perform pairwise and multiple alignments of the DNA sequences and deduced amino acid sequences. Approximately 70 GenBank-published sequences were used for alignment and phylogenetic tree construction. The phylogenetic analysis was conducted via MEGA6 using the maximum likelihood method and the Kimura 2-parameter model. The bootstrap value was 1000 replicates. The sequences of isolates obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KU764746-KU764766, KY421037-KY421038, and MG800835-MG800837.</p>
