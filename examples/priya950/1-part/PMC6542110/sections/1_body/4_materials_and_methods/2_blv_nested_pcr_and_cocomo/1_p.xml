<p id="Par26">The nested PCR assay was performed to detect the BLV proviral DNA and obtain the BLV env fragments using PrimeSTAR (HS) DNA polymerase (Takara, Japan). The primers used in this study are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The first-round PCR program was as follows: 98 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 98 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 20 s, and 68 °C for 1 min, followed by 68 °C for 5 min. The second-round PCR conditions were the same, but internal primers were used (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The PCR products were then agarose-gel purified (gel-purification kit, Omega) and sequenced (Sangers’ analysis, Comate company, Changchun, China). The env-product size was approximately 600 bp, 423-bp fragment of which was used for phylogenetic analysis. The CoCoMo-qPCR-2 assay, as described previously [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], was applied to confirm its efficacy in checking the existence of BLV proviral DNA. Briefly, the primers and the probe aiming at the BLV long terminal repeat (LTR) region were synthesized (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). LA-Taq polymerase (Takara, Japan) was used in this amplification. The CoCoMo-qPCR-2 program was performed as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, followed by 60 °C for 5 min. In addition, a pair of primers was designed to obtain the BLV gag sequences (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). PrimeSTAR (HS) DNA polymerase was used in the system. The PCR program for gag amplification was as follows: 98 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 98 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min, followed by 68 °C for 5 min. The size of the gag fragment was approximately 1.9 kb, and the fragment was subjected to a downstream sequencing analysis.
