<p>In conclusion, data collected by the French 
 <italic>Sentinelles</italic> network since 1984 allowed us to highlight a declining trend in influenza epidemic size and height. This decrease could be related to several factors including increased vaccine coverage, hygiene improvements and diminished fitness of influenza viruses. Future researches combining epidemiological and virological issues should help to identify and quantify impact of contributing factors to this observed decrease.
