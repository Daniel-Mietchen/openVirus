<p>Our study has some limitations. We implemented a single influenza epidemic detection method among the various used worldwide.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> Based on its performances 
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> and to ensure consistency with all data and scientific papers on the French 
 <italic>Sentinelles</italic> network, we opted for the periodic regression used since 1991.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> A recruitment bias was possible as ILI cases reported by SGPs were not virologically confirmed and could be caused by other viruses than influenza. However, we used a very specific definition 
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> and we included ILI cases only during the epidemic period—where influenza positivity rates of cases were the highest, allows to reduce this bias.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Our study based on ILI consultations with a febrile ILI definition could underestimate true influenza burden in the community, especially among elderly who usually had lower symptoms (eg, low fever). Moreover, we did not include cases observed in nursing homes, where elderly could have worse health than those consulting in primary care. Conversely, influenza burden in children could be overestimated relatively to adults’ estimates as children may be more likely to consult a GP than adults.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> However, consistency of data collection since 1984,
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> using the same ILI definition and epidemic detection method, allowed comparisons over time, as potential bias, if occurred, would be constant in time.
