<p>Influenza epidemic size and height observed in primary care decreased over time, especially among adults and elderly. The fourth largest epidemics were observed during the 80s, affecting more than 6% of the population by year (1984/85, 1985/86, 1988/89 and 1989/90). This decline was also observed in the Netherlands between 1986 and 2006,

 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> and in New Zealand over 1997‐2006.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> We found that this decreased in size was not associated with a decrease in epidemic duration, which may suggest a reduction of transmissibility of influenza viruses. At first sight, this can be related to the influenza vaccination programme developed in France from the beginning of 80s, targeting first only elderly (≥75 years) and enlarged progressively to people aged 70 years and over and people with chronic conditions (in 1988 and then in 1991) and finally to people aged 65 years and over (in 2000).
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> As a result, vaccine coverage of people aged 65 or over increased from 56% to 70% between 1989/90 and 2008/09 (Groupe d'Expertise et d'information sur la grippe, data not published), but this rate has declined after the 2009 pandemic.

 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> had still not been achieved. Unlike to some others countries,
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> influenza vaccination is not recommended for children in France, although we highlighted that the most affected age group was school‐age children (5‐14 years), regardless of the dominant viruses. For this age group, contact rates are the highest,
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> contributing to a larger transmissibility and risk of infection.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> Although influenza vaccination might contribute to the declining trend in influenza epidemic size and height, its impact could be limited in France. Secondly, observed decrease in influenza incidence rates may also be related to behaviour changes in the population like changing lifestyles (reduced household size, less smoking, cleaner air) and hygiene improvements; which might have contributed to reduce the transmissibility of influenza viruses.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Recently, the 2009 pandemic could have impacted hygiene habits as frequency of hand washing and use of alcohol‐based hand sanitizers which were strongly promoted during the epidemic period and probably remained more frequent since that time.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> Thirdly, changes in the biological properties of circulating influenza viruses may have occurred, particularly for A(H3N2) subtype 
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>—the most dominant virus during the seasons studied. The process of antigenic drifts might decrease affinity for human receptors and could affect the efficiency of infection and transmission.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> Lastly, changes related to consultations and reporting might have occurred over the 33‐year period. However, there were no modifications in the French health system that could have resulted in a significant shift of consulting patterns. In addition, since 1984, SGPs’ reports are electronically transmitted with the same rules and a similar form.
