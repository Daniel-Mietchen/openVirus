<p>Epidemic size declined over the 32 seasonal epidemics studied by 66 cases per 100 000 population per season on average (95% CI −132; −0.2, 
 <italic>P</italic> value = 0.049), along with peak incidence rate with a coefficient of −15 cases per 100 000 population per season on average (IC 95% −28; −2, 
 <italic>P</italic> value = 0.022). Among age groups, we highlighted a decrease in ILI incidence over time for adults (15‐64 years) and elderly (≥65 years) (respectively −65 cases per 100 000 population; 95% CI −127; −2, 
 <italic>P</italic> value = 0.043 and −62; 95% CI −109; −14, 
 <italic>P</italic> value = 0.012) (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12620-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The slopes coefficients were not significantly different from zero in the other age groups (&lt;5 years: 47 cases per 100 000 population, 95% CI −46; 140; 5‐14 years: −93 cases per 100 000 population, 95% CI −217; 32). We did not bring out changes in epidemic duration over the period (
 <italic>P</italic> value = 0.93).
