<p>The health and socio‐economic impact of influenza epidemics, along with the need to assess the impact of influenza vaccine in the field, justify its surveillance. Real‐time monitoring of influenza epidemics is used by authorities and healthcare professionals to implement or adjust interventions. However, retrospective analysis of influenza epidemics over a long period of time seems essential to better understand disease seasonality, variation of long‐term trend and potentially forecast future trends. This allows providing information to adapt overall strategies for prevention and control and to plan management of healthcare facilities.</p>
