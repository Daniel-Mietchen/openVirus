<p>Using these collected data, virological dominance and co‐dominance by influenza epidemic was established using the following decision rule adapted from literature.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> The main circulating virus type or subtype was considered as “dominant” if: (a) it accounted for 70% or more of all isolates during the season or (b) it accounted between 40% and &lt;70% of all isolates and the second most common virus type or subtype accounted for &lt;30%. Two types or subtypes are considered as “co‐dominant” if the main circulating virus accounted between 40% and &lt;70% of all isolates and the second most common accounted for 30% or more of all isolates.
