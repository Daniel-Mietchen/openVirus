 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> A sample of French GPs located all over the country participates on a voluntary basis to data reporting. In 2017, 458 sentinel general practitioners (SGPs) out of the 61 535 French GPs (0.8%) participated in the surveillance varying from 0.36% (228/62 775) in 2004 to 1.0% (509/49 314) in 1988. A previous study has analysed differences between SGPs and all French GPs.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> SGPs were similar to other GPs for age and practice of a complementary medicine, but they differed in a number of ways: they were more frequently males, their number of consultation by week were slightly higher and were not equally spread over the territory.
