<p>Since late 1984, SGPs reported throughout the year weekly numbers of ILI cases seen in consultation and described these cases.
 <xref rid="irv12620-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> An ILI case is defined as a sudden onset of fever over 39°C with myalgia and respiratory symptoms. The description form for ILI cases has changed over years adding specific questions linked to public health issues. They concern: age, sex, influenza seasonal vaccination status (since September 1986) and whether the delay between vaccination and onset of symptoms is more than 3 weeks (2 weeks since September 2014), hospitalization request (since September 1997), risk factors for influenza complications except age (since September 2009), antiviral prescription (since September 2009), antibiotic prescription and its name (since September 2013).
