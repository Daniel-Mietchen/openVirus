  <p>Phylogenetic relationship of novel sand flyâ€“associated phlebovirus Ntepes virus from Kenya (red bold text) in relation to other selected members of the 
   <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genus. A) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; B) nucleocapsid protein; C) glycoprotein Gn; D) glycoprotein Gc. The phylogenetic trees were inferred based on complete large, medium, and small protein sequences, applying maximum likelihood analysis in PhyML version 3.0 (

Statistical support of the tree topology was evaluated by bootstrap resampling of the sequences 1,000 times. Sequences are identified by virus name and branch colors. Bootstrap values &gt;70 are indicated at the nodes. Scale bar represents numbers of substitutions per site.
