<p>We describe a previously unknown phlebovirus discovered during vector surveillance in Kenya, which we designate Ntepes virus (NPV), after the place of sampling of virus-infected sand flies. The complete genome of NPV was sequenced, viral species tropism in cell culture assessed, and pathogenicity in vertebrates proven by infection of mice. Human serum samples from Ntepes and other communities yielded evidence of human infection based on specific virus neutralization.</p>
