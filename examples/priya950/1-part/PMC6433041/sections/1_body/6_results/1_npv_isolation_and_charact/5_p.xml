<p>Although sequence-based species demarcation criteria have not been determined for phlebovirus species, such criteria exist for the related orthobunyaviruses. Species demarcation criteria are now based on the RdRp gene, which shows 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>6% difference to the closest related virus. Previously unique orthobunyavirus species were defined on 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>10% difference in N protein sequences (

 </xref>). The N proteins of NPV and GFV differ by 15% (GFV itself is not formally classified as a species, and any of the formally classified phlebovirus species are markedly more distant from NPV in this and other genes;
