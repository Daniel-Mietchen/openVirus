<p>In total, 6,434 sand flies were trapped (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). A subset of 5,481 sandflies was pooled and the resulting 111 pools individually inoculated in VeroE6/7 cells. One pool consisting of 8 females induced CPE 4–5 days postinfection. Sequence analysis of the 
 <italic>COI</italic> gene of the sand flies of this CPE-positive pool suggested that sand flies were of the genus 
 <italic>Sergentomyia</italic>. We identified blood-meal hosts for 62 blood-fed specimens sampled at the same place and time as the pooled specimens. Results revealed that 56 (90.3%) had fed on humans, 2 (3.2%) on snakes, and 1 (1.6%) each on a frog, lizard, cow, and ostrich. The infectious cell culture supernatant tested negative for RVFV, orthobunyaviruses, alphaviruses, and members of genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. We amplified a 0.5-kb fragment of the RdRp gene of sand fly–borne phleboviruses using degenerated primers (

 </xref>). The sequence showed the highest pairwise identity of 79% to GFV and 75% to KARV. We sampled a subset of 953 individual sand fly samples 2 years after the initial study and tested it in pools of 10 by specific RT-PCR for the cultured virus; results were negative.
