<p>Phylogenetic analyses of NPV RdRp, Gn, Gc, and N proteins and all available sand flyâ€“borne phlebovirus sequences indicate that NPV forms a strongly supported clade with GFV and KARV. NPV branches as a sister taxon to GFV in all genes, suggesting NPV to be a member of the Karimabad species complex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the designation of the Karimabad species complex is not yet officially approved by the ICTV. For a provisional genetic classification, we analyzed the intragenetic distances among established phlebovirus species and unclassified isolates based on the RdRp gene. Pairwise nucleotide and amino acid distances between established species ranged from 38% to 62% for nucleotide distances and 39% to 68% for amino acid distances (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figure). For example, amino acid distance between Punta Toro virus and Candiru virus was 39% and between SFTS virus and sandfly fever Naples virus was 68%. Pairwise nucleotide distances ranged from 20% to 59% and amino acid distances from 6% to 69% when unclassified tentative species and variants pertaining to established species were included. For example, amino acid distance between Ponticelli virus and Adana virus was 6% and between Naples virus and SFTS virus was 69% (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figure). NPV showed 7% amino acid distance to GFV and 19% amino acid distance to KARV.
