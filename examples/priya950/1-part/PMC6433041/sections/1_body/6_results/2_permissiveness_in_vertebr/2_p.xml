<p>Because GFV is known to induce fatal disease in laboratory mice (

 </xref>), we explored similarities in pathogenicity with NPV. We intracranially inoculated 3–4-day-old Swiss Albino suckling mice, causing tremors, hind-limb paralysis, prostration, and death 5–8 days postinfection (

 <sup>6</sup> PFU/mL). Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo pathogenicity studies of NPV, including the pathogenicity in suckling mice, may suggest that rodents and sand flies may be involved in the maintenance cycle of NPV.
