<p>Because NPV is genetically most closely related to GFV and KARV, we tested all NPV-positive serum samples for ability to cross-neutralize GFV or KARV. All tests yielded negative results, providing further support for the classification of NPV as a separate serotype (and species). Because RVFV frequently causes outbreaks in East Africa, we also tested against RVFV, which, according to its phylogenetic relationship with NPV, is not expected to cross-react with NPV. Seven of 26 NPV-neutralizing serum samples were also reactive with RVFV, showing titers that did not correlate in height with titers against NPV (
