<p>Twenty-six (13.9%) serum samples neutralized NPV, with titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:320 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Women and men were infected at equal rates. Positive samples originated from Marigat (10.2%) and Sangailu (15.6%), without statistical differences in rates (Fisher exact test odds ratio [OR] 0.6, 95% CI 0.19–1.70; p = 0.37). Detection rates in Sangailu did not differ between healthy and febrile patients (Fisher exact test OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.40–4.3; p = 0.58) (

The detection of NPV neutralizing antibodies in geographically unlinked regions of Kenya suggests widespread previous human exposure and infection.
