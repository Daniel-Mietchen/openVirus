<p>We purified and concentrated virions from the supernatant of infected Vero cells by ultracentrifugation through a 36% sucrose cushion. We extracted viral RNA using the QIAGEN RNeasy Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. We generated cDNA using the Maxima H Minus Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit and random hexamer primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

We prepared DNA libraries using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit and analyzed them on an Illumina MiSeq instrument with the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.illumina.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.illumina.com</ext-link>). We identified viral reads by reference mapping to phleboviruses as well as by BLAST comparisons against a local amino acid sequence library containing translations of open reading frames (ORFs) of phleboviruses. We closed sequence gaps by conventional RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. We performed genome assembly using Geneious (

We identified ORFs using Geneious, compared nucleotide and amino acid sequences with other sequences by blastn and blastx searches against the GenBank database, and identified protein motifs by web-based comparison to the Pfam database (
