<p>Archived serum samples from the Marigat district hospital, taken during 2010–2011, and from Sangailu Health Centre in the Hulugho subcounty in northeastern Kenya, collected during 2010–2012, were available (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We performed a virus neutralization test using 2-fold serial dilutions of serum samples (1:20 to 1:640). We mixed 50 μL of the serial serum dilutions with 70 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of NPV. Mixtures were incubated at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 1 h, then used for infection of a confluent Vero E6/7 cell monolayer seeded in 96-well culture plates with 2 wells/dilution. After 7 days of incubation, we recorded the highest serum dilution at which no CPE was observed in at least 50% of the wells as the neutralization titer.
