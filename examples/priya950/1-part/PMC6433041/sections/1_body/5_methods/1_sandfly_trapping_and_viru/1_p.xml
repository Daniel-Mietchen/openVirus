<p>We trapped sandflies using CDC light traps (John W. Hock,

We homogenized pools of 5–50 female specimens in minimum essential medium (MEM), inoculated an aliquot of the clarified supernatant (50 μL) into Vero cells, and incubated it for up to 14 days with daily monitoring for cytopathic effect (CPE). We passaged CPE-positive supernatant onto fresh Vero E6/7 cells; virus stock solution was generated from the first passage and used for all further experiments. We determined the infectious titer by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) assay using 10-fold serial dilutions from
 <sup>–</sup> 10
 <sup>–1</sup> to 10
 <sup>–12</sup> of the virus stock inoculated in 5 wells each of subconfluent Vero cells seeded in a 96-well plate. We calculated the virus titer according to Reed and Muench (
