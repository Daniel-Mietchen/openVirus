<p>We infected cell lines from insects (LL-5, sand fly; C6/36, mosquito), humans (HEK293-T), small mammals (BHK-21, hamster; VeroE6/7, primate; MEF, mouse; EidNi, bat) and livestock (PK-15, swine; ZN-R, goat; DF-1, chicken; KN-R, cattle) in doublets, at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. We harvested aliquots of infectious cell culture supernatants every 24 h for periods of 7 d and quantified viral genome copies by real-time RT-PCR with plasmid-based quantification standards.</p>
