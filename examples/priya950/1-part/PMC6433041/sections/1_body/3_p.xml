<p>Sand fly–borne phleboviruses have been studied mainly in the Mediterranean region. Prevalence data for sub-Saharan Africa remain scarce. Studies have found serologic evidence of human infections with Karimabad, sandfly fever Naples, and sandfly fever Sicilian viruses in patients from Sudan with febrile illness (
