<p>Toscana, sandfly fever Sicilian, and sandfly fever Naples viruses are distributed in the Mediterranean region and northern Africa. GFV has been reported from Sudan, Senegal, Central African Republic, Nigeria, and Benin (

Our results show that NPV-immune serum samples do not react with GFV or KARV, suggesting that the reactivity of the positive human samples was the result of previous infection with NPV.
