<p>NPV appears to have a wide distribution in Kenya; we found equal exposure rates in 2 geographic sets of humans sampled &gt;600 km apart. The serum samples from this study were collected during 2010–2012, suggesting that NPV has been present in humans since at least 2010. Sand fly pools collected in 2014 had low infection rates (MIR 0.18, 1/111 pools, 5–50 sand flies/pool), possibly resulting from collection during a period with low transmission rates. The estimated MIR is lower compared with previous sand fly infections with phleboviruses such as Punique (MIR 6.7) (

The significance of just 1 isolate of the novel phlebovirus from 111 sand fly pools may seem limited, but it is noteworthy that circulation of RVFV, a phlebovirus with huge epidemic potential, is generally detected at low rates in vectors during interepidemic periods. For instance, multiple surveillance efforts sampling and analyzing thousands of primary and secondary RVFV vectors from outbreak hotspot areas failed to yield any RVFV isolates (
