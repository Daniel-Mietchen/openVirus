<p>We identified a high percentage of neutralizing antibodies to NPV in humans living in the NPV-endemic area by neutralization assay, confirming that NPV represents a distinct phleboviral species that causes infection in humans. The fact that the virus was isolated through an exploratory sampling effort is an indicator of the existence of undetected and uncharacterized viruses in this part of Kenya. Although mosquitoes have been the focus of studies on emerging arboviruses, the discovery of a novel sand flyâ€“borne phlebovirus with evidence for human exposure across Kenya indicates the need to broaden vector surveillance activities.</p>
