<p>RNAs were extracted directly from the swabs using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA extracts were then analyzed by MeV genotyping RT-PCR in search of 634 nucleotides of the N-gene with forward primer MeV214 (
 <monospace>5'-TAACAATGATGGAGAGGGTAGG-3'</monospace>) and reverse primer MeV216 (
 <monospace>5'-TGGAGCTATGCCATGG GAGT-3'</monospace>). The SuperScript
 <sup>™</sup> III one-step system with PlatinumW Taq High Fidelity enzyme was used for amplification of the target gene fragment. The RT-PCR mixture was composed of 17 μl DNAse/RNAse-free water, 25 μl of 2X buffer, 1 μl of MeV214 primer, 1 μl of MeV216 primer, 1 μl of the enzyme, and 5μl of the RNA extract. RT-PCR was programmed for 40 cycles including a reverse transcription step of 30 minutes at 50°C and 15 minutes at 95°C, a denaturation step of 30 seconds at 94°C, primers hybridization of 30 second at 55°C, an initial elongation of one minute at 72°C, a final elongation of 10 minutes at 72°C and storage at 4°C. The RT-PCR products were revealed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis after 30 minutes migration for 250 volts. All RT-PCR positive products were sequenced using the MeV214 and MeV216 primers and the resulting sequences were edited and assembled into a single consensus using the CLC Mainworkbench 5.5 software.
