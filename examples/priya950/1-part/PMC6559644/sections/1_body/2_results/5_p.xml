<p>To investigate the time of introduction of the ECSA lineage in the state of Rio de Janeiro, we performed a sampling time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework [
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A regression of genetic divergence from root to tip against sampling dates confirmed sufficient temporal signal (r2 = 0.68). Our Bayesian time-scaled phylogenies showed that ten (90.9%) genomes generated in this study formed a well-supported clade (posterior probability support = 1.0) comprising isolates from Rio de Janeiro state, sampled between 2015–2017; while only one isolate from 2018 (isolate RJ137, accession number: MK244642) was placed in a different cluster with an isolate from Paraíba state (northeast Brazil) sampled in 2016 (accession number: KY704954) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217871.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Although the RJ105 and RJ137 isolates are both from the same municipality of São João de Meriti, they have different sampling collection dates, 2016 and 2018 respectively. We identified 10 amino acid substitutions that were present only in the RJ137 isolate when compared to the other 10 isolates generated in this study (

The presence of these unique mutations in the RJ137 isolate is consistent with its latest sampling date, indicating that this isolate had more time to undergo genetic change and its clustering with an isolate (KY704954) from a northeast state might represent a second event of viral introduction in Rio de Janeiro.
