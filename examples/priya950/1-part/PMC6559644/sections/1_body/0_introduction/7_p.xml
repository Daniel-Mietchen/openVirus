<p>The state of Rio de Janeiro is located in the south-eastern region of Brazil and it registered an influx of 1,6 million airline passengers and 12,710 international and domestic flights, during the Olympic Games in August 2016 [

Moreover, the state, whose capital city is the second biggest of Brazil, is an important hub for busyness, tourism and it is well connected to the main metropolitan regions in the country. Nevertheless, there is limited information about the genomic epidemiology of CHIKV circulating in Rio de Janeiro from genomic surveillance studies. The shortage of complete genomic sequences available impairs our understanding of the CHIKV introduction and establishment in the region. Thus, to better understand the chikungunya outbreak in Rio de Janeiro, we generated 11 near-complete genomes collected from 2016 to 2018 using portable nanopore sequencing and present a genomic epidemiology that sheds new light on the introduction and establishment of ECSA lineage in Rio de Janeiro.
