<p>We performed protein alignments of our obtained sequences to investigate the presence of the A226V (E1 protein) or the L210Q (E2 protein) substitutions, however we did not observe in our samples any of those mutations associated with increased CHIKV transmission in

However, future investigation of the fitness, viral infectivity and evolution of CHIKV in mosquito populations, together with continued genomic surveillance, will determine whether the upsurge in the number of cases in Rio in 2018 was due to the acquisition of specific mutations that increase replication rates in local
