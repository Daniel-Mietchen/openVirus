<p>Together, our results indicate CHIKV ECSA lineage might have spread to Rio de Janeiro from the north-eastern region of Brazil and shed light on the epidemiological dynamics of the virus in urban areas of the Rio de Janeiro, where the virus remained undetected by several months before reporting of the first local transmission cases in that state. In conclusion, our study shows that genomic data generated by real time portable sequencing technology can be employed to assist public health laboratories in monitoring and understanding the diversity of circulating mosquito-borne viruses.</p>
