<p>Moreover, our data suggests that the circulation of the CHIKV-ECSA lineage in Rio de Janeiro may have resulted from at least two separate introductions events from the north-eastern region, where this lineage was first detected in late 2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The first event is indicated by the Rio de Janeiro clade which was dated to mid-2014 and consists of 28 isolates, including the 10 sequences generated in this study. The second introduction event, in turn, is represented by the RJ137 isolate, sampled in 2018, which formed a cluster with one isolate (KY704954) sampled in 2016 from a north-eastern state, and this cluster was dated to mid-2015.
