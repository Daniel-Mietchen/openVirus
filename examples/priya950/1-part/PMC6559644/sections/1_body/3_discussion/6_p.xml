<p>Genome sequencing has become a powerful tool for tracking virus transmission. The analysis of full or near full length genomes maximize the usefulness of molecular clock models to infer time-scaled phylogenetic trees. These models can statistically describe the relationship between viruses genetic distances and sampling time to infer phylogenies, where branch lengths represent time, and this natural timescale of months or years can be used as a reference for directly comparing evolutionary rate with known historical events [

 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This approach has been used in genomic epidemiology studies of arbovirus during epidemics in Brazil [

 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 54 genomes of ZIKV sampled during the 2015–2017 epidemic provided estimates of the date of introduction and the period of cryptic circulation of the virus in north-eastern Brazil, as well as the date of dissemination of the virus to other countries in the Americas [

 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. By analyzing 64 new yellow fever virus genomes the virus transmission pattern was revealed to have origin in non-human primates, rejecting the hypothesis of urban transmissions.
