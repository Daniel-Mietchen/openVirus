<p>In this study, by performing real-time portable nanopore sequencing, we generated 11 new CHIKV near-complete genomic sequences from 2016â€“2018 collected in several municipalities in the Rio de Janeiro state. The generated genomic data allowed us to estimate the introduction date of the ECSA lineage in Rio de Janeiro to June 2015, suggesting an undetected circulation of the virus for 5 months before the first reports of CHIKV transmission in Rio de Janeiro [

 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. According to the Ministry of Health epidemiological bulletin, CHIKV autochthony in Rio de Janeiro was reported in the 47
 <sup>th</sup> epidemiological week of 2015, around November 2015. Prior to that, only imported cases had been registered. Our estimates indicate a more recent introduction event of the ECSA lineage in Rio de Janeiro compared to a recently published study [
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In our analysis we used a larger and updated dataset including recently published 18 new CHIKV ECSA sequences from northern region of Brazil. The substantial difference (around 17 months) between Souza et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] estimates and ours might reflect evolutionary models choice and the analyzed dataset. Nevertheless, our results are in agreement with Nunes et al. (2015) [
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the epidemiological data reported by the Brazilian health system [
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
