<p>The 11 new genomic sequences reported in this study were initially submitted to a genotyping analysis performed by Genome Detective virus tool online (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genomedetective.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.genomedetective.com/</ext-link>). New sequences were aligned to 229 complete or almost complete CHIKV genomic sequences (&gt;10,000 bp), retrieved from NCBI in November 2018 and covering all four existing lineages. We also included 6 sequences from a recent outbreak in Brazilian Amazon region [

 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Alignment was performed using MAFFT online program [
 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The complete dataset was assessed for presence of phylogenetic signal by applying the likelihood mapping analysis implemented in the IQ-TREE 1.6.8 software (

 <xref rid="pone.0217871.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny was reconstructed from the concatenated dataset (n = 240) using IQ-TREE 1.6.8 software under the HKY nucleotide substitution model with 4 gamma categories (HKY+G4) which was inferred in jModelTest (
