<p>Amplicons were purified using 1x AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter) and cleaned-up PCR products concentrations were measured using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit on a Qubit 3.0 fluorimeter (ThermoFisher). DNA library preparation was performed on 11 selected samples (selection based on DNA concentration after clean-up being &gt; 4ng/μL) using the Ligation Sequencing Kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and Native Barcoding Expansion 1–12 kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), whose reactions conditions have already been described [

After PCR, each pool is purified, and its DNA concentration is quantified using Qubit. Then, both pools (A and B) are joined in a single tube (taking in consideration the DNA concentrations of each pool), and one barcode was used per sample in order to maximize the number of samples per flow cell. Sequencing library was generated from the barcoded products using the Genomic DNA Sequencing Kit SQK-MAP007/SQK-LSK208 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Sequencing library was loaded onto a R9.4 flow cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Sequencing was performed for 48 hours on MinION device, although data acquisition can be performed from 4h to 72h. Acquisition of the final consensus sequences was performed following a previously published protocol [
