 <p>Flaviviral vertebrate amplifying host(s), invertebrate vector(s), genetics, and environmental factors shape the viral geographical distribution and epidemic disease pattern. Newly emerging dengue virus genotypes, West Nile virus clades, or Zika virus strains exhibited an enhancement in mosquito vector competence. However, hosts and viral determinants responsible for the occurrence of JEV genotype replacement remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that emerging GI viruses with enhanced transmission potential in amplifying hosts such as pigs and avian species was encoded by three critical GI-specific mutations in NS2B/NS3 proteins. This discovery provides insight into the viral genetic mechanism underlying the GI virus advantage and adaptation in the pig/avian species-mosquito cycle. Our results also emphasize the importance of monitoring viral evolution in amplifying vertebrate hosts to clarify the role of avian species in local transmission of GI virus in JE endemic and epidemic countries.</p>
