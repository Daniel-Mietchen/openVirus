  <title>NS1-3 genes determine the major replication advantage of rGI virus in amplifying host-derived cell lines.</title>
  <p>(A) The schematic diagram displays viral genes encoded in the infectious clones and rJEVs. GIII virus- and GI virus-derived genes are shown in dark gray and red, respectively. (B) The infectious clones were transfected into BHK-21 cells and incubated for 3 to 4 days. The replication of rJEVs was detected in the cells by immunofluorescence using mouse anti-JEV NS1 antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies. The cellular nucleus was localized by DAPI staining. The secretion of rJEVs was analyzed by the plaque assay in BHK-21 cells. (C-F) The rJEVs were inoculated onto C6/36 (C), VERO (D), PK-15 (E), and DF-1 (F) cells at 0.5 MOI, and incubated at 28°C (C6/36) or at 41°C (VERO, PK-15, DF-1). Supernatants were collected from each rJEV-infected cell culture at 24 and 48 HPI, and viral titers determined by micro-antigen focus assay. Mean with SEM for triplicates is shown. A horizontal dotted line indicates the detection limit. The statistical analysis was conducted with one-way ANOVA followed by a post test using Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison Test using rGIII virus as a control. An asterisk indicates that rJEV has a significantly higher titer than rGIII virus (P&lt; 0.05).</p>
