  <title>Computational prediction of the secondary structure formed by 5’UTR and 3’UTR of JEV genome.</title>
  <p>The viral RNA sequence, beginning with 151 nucleotides from the 5’terminal followed by poly(A) linker and 118 nucleotides from 3’terminal, is used to predict the cyclization structure at 37°C and 41°C with mfold web server. The ΔG value of the cyclization structure is indicated.</p>
