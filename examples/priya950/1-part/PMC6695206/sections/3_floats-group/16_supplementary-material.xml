  <title>Detection of RNAemia in rGIII and rGIII/GI NS1-3 viruses-infected pigs and chickens.</title>
  <p>(A and B) The viral RNA in plasma collected from the infected pigs (A) at days 0 to 8, and from the infected chickens (B) at 60 HPI, respectively, were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Each dot represents an individual animal. A horizontal dotted line indicates the detection limit. Mean with SEM is showed. The RNAemia in chicken plasma was statistically analyzed with one-way ANOVA, followed by Turkeyâ€™s Multiple Comparison Test. A significant difference is indicated by an asterisk ([B], P&lt; 0.05).</p>
