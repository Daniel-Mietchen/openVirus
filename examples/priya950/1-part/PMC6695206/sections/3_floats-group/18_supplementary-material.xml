  <title>The infectivity rate of rGIII and rGI viruses in infectious center assays.</title>
  <p>rJEVs were incubated with VERO, PK-15, and DF-1 cells at an MOI of 5 at 37Â°C for 1 hour. Then, the infected cells were serially diluted and used to infect VERO cells using a micro-antigen focus assay. The number of infected cells releasing infectious particles was estimated and shown as ffu. The infectivity rate was calculated as the number of ffu divided by number of infected cells.</p>
