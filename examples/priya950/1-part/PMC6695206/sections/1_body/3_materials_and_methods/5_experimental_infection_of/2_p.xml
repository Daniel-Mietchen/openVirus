<p>Thirteen ten-week old, JEV-seronegative SPF pigs were used to determine the replication ability of field-isolated JEVs (nine pigs) and rJEV (four pigs). SPF pigs were anesthetized with stresnil (China Chemical and Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd) and subcutaneously inoculated with PBS or 10
 <sup>5</sup> ffu of GIII CH1392 virus, GI YL2009-4 virus, or 10
 <sup>7</sup> ffu of rJEVs. Experimental pigs were monitored, the daily body temperatures were recorded, and clinical signs of infection were noted. Pig plasmas were recovered at different days post infection. All pigs were euthanized with electrical stunning at 8 DPI.
