<p>Laboratory-hatched female 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> mosquitoes were fed with 10% sucrose and maintained at 28°C. Mosquitoes were starved for 1 day prior to the blood-feeding experiment. The mosquitoes were fed 
 <italic>per os</italic> with a JEV viremic blood meal, a mixture of pig blood cells and 8×10
 <sup>6</sup> ffu/ml of JEV according to the previous study [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and the stock titer of JEVs used in this study. The virus-infected mosquitoes were maintained in the different cage at 28°C. Infected mosquitoes were collected from cages by aspiration and homogenized individually at 14 days post- infection (DPI).
