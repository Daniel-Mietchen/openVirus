<p>The site-specific mutation was individually introduced into pCMV GIII/GI NS1-3 or pCMV GIII by site-directed mutagenesis using the following reaction mixes: 1.5 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.4 mM mutagenesis primers (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s011">S1 Table</xref>), 0.5U KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (KOD, Novagen), and the respective cDNA clones. Mutated clones were identified in cDNA constructs, extracted from the transformed competent cells using Mini-prep kit (Qiagen), and sequenced to authenticate the complete viral genome insert.
