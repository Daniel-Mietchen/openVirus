<p>GI virus emerged in the 1990s and has gradually replaced GIII virus as the most frequently isolated JEV genotype from 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic>, stillborn piglets, and JE patients in Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, China, and India [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We suggest that GI virus might compete with GIII virus in the same pig-mosquito cycle and exhibit a transmission advantage over areas previously dominated by GIII virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Emerging GI virus replicates more efficiently in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito-derived cells, birds, and ducklings than GIII virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; however, it remains unknown if the replication efficiency of GI vs. GIII virus occurs in pigs and/or 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> mosquitoes, which play critical roles in local transmission of JEV. In addition, the experimental evidence associated with the difference in viral genomic factor(s) does not fully support the occurrence of GIII replacement during the past 20 years [
