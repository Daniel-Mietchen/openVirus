<p>Migratory birds were suspected of spreading GI-b virus from southern to southeastern Asia and thus associated with JEV genotype replacement [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The ardeid birds (herons and egrets) and pigs play an important role in local transmission of JEV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. All host-derived GI viruses are isolated from pigs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, JEV can infect young domestic poultry (chickens and ducklings) which are suspected of being involved in local transmission of JEV due to viral titers being sufficiently higher than the minimum infectious dose for mosquito hosts [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Earlier or higher viremia in GI-b virus-infected birds [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and ducklings [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] suggested that a domestic avian-mosquito cycle might enhance the transmission of GI viruses. GI-b virus induced higher viremia than GIII virus in pigs, young chickens and ducklings (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g004">Fig 4</xref>). However, previous studies showed similar replication ability of GI-b, JE-91 strain, isolated in 1990 and GIII virus in DF-1 cells and ducklings [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We speculate that this difference could be a result of the genetic variation of earlier GI-b isolates and 3 days older ducklings used in the previous studies [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The NS2B/NS3 protein sequences of GI and GIII viruses used in the previous studies were unavailable. Higher viremia induced by GI-b virus could enhance viral transmission by mosquitoes since the infection rate of JEV was dose-dependent in mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, GI-b virus produced higher levels of viral RNA than GIII virus in pig tonsil and nasal mucosa explants, potentially enhancing oronasal transmission between pigs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Collectively, our study suggests that the replacement of GIII virus with GI-b virus as the dominant and circulating virus in the host-mosquito cycle is the result of enhancement of transmission efficiency in amplifying hosts, including pigs and domestic avian species, not in mosquito vectors.
