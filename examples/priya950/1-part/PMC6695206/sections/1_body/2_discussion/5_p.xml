<p>Flaviviruses adaptation to elevated temperatures have been shown to enhance fitness in avian species and mosquito vectors [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The enhancement of GI-b virus infectivity in amplifying hosts was observed at elevated temperatures (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, the influence of temperature on enzymatic activity, heat shock proteins-interacting ability, and interferon antagonistic ability of GI-b and GIII virus NS2B/NS3 proteins should be investigated in future studies.
