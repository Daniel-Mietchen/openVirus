<p>Enhancement of GI virus replication ability in pig- and poultry-derived cells was further investigated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. JEV–infected pigs exhibited either an asymptomatic manifestation or developed fever with sufficiently high viremia to ensure the transmission of virus by engorged mosquitoes [

 <sup>5</sup> ffu of GIII CH1392 virus, GI YL2009-4 virus, and or PBS into ten-week old, specific-pathogen free (SPF) pigs (three SPF pigs per group), and then monitored daily body temperature and viremia. At 3 DPI, three GI virus-infected pigs developed fever averaging 40.6°C while GIII virus-infected and PBS-inoculated pigs maintained normal body temperature until euthanasia at 8 DPI (

 <sup>4.6</sup> ffu/ ml compared to GIII CH1392 virus-infected pigs with a viral titer of 10
 <sup>2.7</sup> ffu/ml (p&lt; 0.05). However, viremia was undetectable at 4-DPI in all virus- and PBS-inoculated pigs (
