<p>Viremic migratory birds are suspected of spreading GI viruses between countries but the role of avian species in local transmission of GI virus has never been determined [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Experimentally JEV-infected young chickens and ducklings showed an age-dependent ability to induce sufficient viremia for mosquito infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To compare the replication ability of GIII to GI virus in domestic avian species, we subcutaneously inoculated 10
 <sup>4</sup> ffu of GIII CH1392 and T1P1 strains, GI YL2009-4 and TC2009-1 strains or PBS into one-day old chickens (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). As early as 1 DPI, we found that 100% (8/8) and 75% (6/8) of GI virus-infected chickens and ducklings developed viremia, while 37.5% (3/8) and 12.5% (1/8) of GIII virus-infected chickens and ducklings, respectively, developed viremia (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). These results showed that GI viruses replicated to a significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher viremia (0.60â€“1.73-log higher) as well as earlier and longer lasting than GIII viruses in chickens and ducklings. The higher viremia was supported by the higher RNAemia detected in GI virus-infected poultry compared to GIII virus-infected poultry at 2 DPI (p&lt; 0.05) (
