<p>To investigate the viral genetic determinants for the enhancement of GI virus infectivity, we initially analyzed the amino acid variances between seventy-one GIII viruses and seventy-seven GI viruses. Nine and twenty-four GI virus-specific and highly consensus substitutions were identified in structural and non-structural proteins, respectively, and three were non-conservative, charge-altering substitutions (

We also identified the cyclization structural variants formed by GIII and GI viruses in the untranslated region (UTR,

To pin-point the target gene, we constructed five infectious clones of derived chimeric viruses (pCMV GIII/GI UTR, pCMV GIII/GI C-E, pCMV GIII/GI NS1-5, pCMV GIII/GI NS1-3, pCMV GIII/GI NS4-5) and one GI virus infectious clone (pCMV GI) by introducing the variant region of GI virus into the GIII virus infectious clone (pCMV GIII) (

Next we analyzed the replication ability of five chimeric recombinant viruses (rGIII/GI UTR, rGIII/GI C-E, rGIII/GI NS1-5, rGIII/GI NS1-3, and rGIII/GI NS4-5), recombinant GIII (rGIII) virus, and recombinant GI (rGI) virus in C6/36 cells at 28°C and in vertebrate cells (VERO, PK-15, and DF-1) at 41°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g005">Fig 5C–5F</xref>). All recombinant viruses reached similar titers in the range of 10
 <sup>7.09</sup> to 10
 <sup>7.62</sup> ffu/ml in C6/36 cells at 48 HPI. However, rGI virus exhibited a robust replication and significantly higher titer than rGIII virus in VERO (10
 <sup>0.6</sup>-fold difference at 24 HPI, p&lt; 0.05), PK-15, (10
 <sup>1.1</sup> and 10
 <sup>1.4</sup>-fold differences at 24 and 48 HPI, p&lt; 0.05) and DF-1 cells (10
 <sup>0.6</sup>-fold difference at 48 HPI, p&lt; 0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g005">Fig 5D–5F</xref>). Interestingly the rGIII/GI NS1-5 and rGIII/GI NS1-3 viruses replicated as efficiently as rGI virus, and produced a significantly higher titer than rGIII virus in VERO, PK-15, and DF-1 cells (p&lt; 0.05). In contrast, rGIII/GI UTR, rGIII/GI C-E, rGIII/GI NS4-5, and rGIII viruses all maintained a low replication efficiency. These results demonstrated that the major genetic determinants for the enhancement of GI virus infectivity are located within NS1-3 proteins.
