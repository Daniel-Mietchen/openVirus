<p id="Par22">The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Australian recombinant lineage of HPeV3 viruses was evolving between epidemics, however the structural protein amino acid sequence was strongly conserved across the epidemics. This could indicate that the advantages conferred by the current capsid structure in infection of host cells outweighed the need to avoid immunological responses and/or the Australian HPeV-3 was not experiencing sufficient selection pressure to change its structural proteins between and during epidemics, perhaps by circulating mainly in young hosts.</p>
