<p id="Par8">The complete VP0, VP3 and partial VP1 sequence was obtained from the two Taiwan 2011-like HPeV3 viruses using the Ampliseq method. Twelve thousand and twenty-eight thousand reads were generated for these samples. These reads were concentrated over the structural proteins whereas the non-structural protein genes had very low and sporadic coverage. The nucleotide sequence in these samples was supplemented with Sanger sequencing of the amplicons from the VP1 typing PCR
