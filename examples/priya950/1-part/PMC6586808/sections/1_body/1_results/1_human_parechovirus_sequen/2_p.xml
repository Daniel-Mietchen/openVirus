<p id="Par7">The Ampliseq panel, as expected, generated the most data when the Australian recombinant HPeV3 was present in a given sample (between 0.2 and 3.8 million reads per sample). The complete coding sequence of the polyprotein was obtained from all but one of the 24 cases (case W13; from which we obtained the full capsid region, complete 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3C and partial 3D polymerase). Partial 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR sequences were also obtained from these samples, except for case W13 where no 3′UTR sequence data was generated. Regions of low coverage (&lt;5 reads) were seen in samples from 9 cases around nucleotides 3600–3800 and/or 4200–4400 (in relation to sequence KY55666.1) and Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the sequence in these regions.</p>
