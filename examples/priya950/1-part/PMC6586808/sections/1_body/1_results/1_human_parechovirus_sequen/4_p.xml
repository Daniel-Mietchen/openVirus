<p id="Par9">The Ampliseq panel typically generated the lowest number of reads in samples containing an HPeV1, with four of the samples generating no usable sequence data by this method. These samples were typed using the VP1 typing PCR. In case V2, the VP1 PCR failed to produce an amplicon, and the typing was therefore based on the original VP1 PCR sequencing done on this sample at the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory (VIDRL). Sequence fragments of each HPeV1 did not cover exactly the same region of the VP1 coding sequence, so two alignments were created. The first alignment was 421nt long and included sequences from cases V1, V2, V3, V15 and V16. The nucleotide percentage similarity matrix is shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. Percentage similarity of the sequences ranged from 77 to 99%. The second alignment was 474nt and included sequences from cases W14, W17, V1, V3, V15 and V16. The nucleotide percentage similarity matrix is shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>. Percentage similarity ranged from 77.6 to 98.5%. Only 2 cases were related (V3 and V16 within about 1% differences), while all others were 10% or more different from each other and thus most likely represent separate introductions or multiple circulating lineages separated by several years of evolution.
