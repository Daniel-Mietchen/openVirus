<p id="Par13">In cases W1 to W17, information on the average duration of stay in hospital was available. Fifteen of these cases were attributed to the Australian recombinant HPeV3 while two were due to infection with HPeV1. The average and median duration of hospitalization for the HPeV3 infected infants was 3.87 and 4 days respectively (range 1–10 days). The average and median duration of the HPeV1 infected infants was 4.5 days (range 4–5 days).
