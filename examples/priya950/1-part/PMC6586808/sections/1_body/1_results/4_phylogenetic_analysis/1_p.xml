<p id="Par14">Recombination, selection and phylogenetic analysis was performed on the 23 complete polyprotein sequences and partial 5′ and 3′ UTRs from the Australian recombinant type 3 viruses. Other HPeV3 sequences available in GenBank which belonged to this recombinant lineage at the time of writing were also included (Supplementary Table
