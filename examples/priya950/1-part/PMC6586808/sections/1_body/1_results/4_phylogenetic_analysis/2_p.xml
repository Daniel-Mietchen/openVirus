<p id="Par15">No evidence of further recombination was detected in the HPeV3 sequences from the Australian epidemics. Selection analysis (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>) found that the codons in the polyprotein of the Australian recombinant HPeV3 viruses were under negative selection pressure to not change their amino acid sequence, particularly in the structural genes. The REL analysis identified 8 sites in the non-structural genes which were potentially undergoing positive selection, however SLAC and FEL at significance level of p &lt; 0.05, did not identify any sites under positive selection pressure.
