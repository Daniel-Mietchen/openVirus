<p id="Par18">This low rate was reflected in the amino acid phylogenetic analysis and in the dN/dS rate (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The amino acid sequence of the recombinant HPeV3 capsid proteins varied very little between the 2013, 2015 and 2017 epidemics in Australia. Most virus sequences had identical amino acid sequences, with sequences possessing 1–3 amino acid changes at most.
