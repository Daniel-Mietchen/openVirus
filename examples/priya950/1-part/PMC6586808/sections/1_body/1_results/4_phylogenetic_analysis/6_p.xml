<p id="Par19">Within the non-structural proteins of the Australian recombinant HPeV3 viruses, a hotspot of variability was observed in the 2C non-structural gene with codons 1359 and 1366 of the polyprotein changing from polar to basic amino acids in some sequences (codon 1359: asparagine or lysine; codon 1366: glutamine or arginine) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). As these changes could potentially affect the structure/function of the 2C protein, the association between one or two basic amino acids and the clinical observation of sepsis-like syndrome was investigated. Clinical information was available for twenty two of the twenty four cases infected with the Australian recombinant HPeV3. Sepsis-like disease was reported in 5 of the 12 cases where the viruses had 1 basic amino acid at sites 1359 and 1366. Sepsis-like syndrome was observed in 7 cases of the 10 infected with viruses with two basic amino acids. While sepsis-like syndrome was seen in more cases with two basic amino acids, the association was not statistically significant (p = 0.15, Fisher’s exact test).
