<p id="Par20">The minimum spanning network of the polyprotein nucleotide sequences of the Australian recombinant HPeV3 identified in this study is shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>. There was clustering of the recombinant HPeV3 sequences by the year of sampling. There were two distinct networks of sequences observed in the 2015 epidemic. The network indicated that the sequences from the 2017 epidemic were descendants from viruses belonging to just one of these 2015 networks; notably, a group of viruses having two basic amino acids in the 2C gene (see above). Within the 2017 epidemic, there were three subnetworks of cases, and these likely each represented just a small fraction of larger transmission networks. One network was a Sydney-centric outbreak occurring over November and December 2017 (including cases W1, W3, W5, W7, W8, W9, W10, W12). Interestingly, this network included sequences with either one or two basic amino acids in the 2C gene. The other two networks were made up of cases from wider geographic regions and over longer time periods (4 to 7 months) and one of these networks (cases V4, V7, V14 and W4, W11) had viruses with two basic amino acids in 2C and the other network (cases V5, V6, V8, V9, V10 and W2, W6, W15, W16) only a single basic amino acid. Case V8 (Sample V7181489) sat at the end of a long branch in one of the networks, suggesting it was quite different from the next most similar sequence. This one case came from a town over 800 km from Sydney NSW, and was the most geographically isolated sample (See Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Interestingly, the 2017 virus most closely related to the 2015 ancestors, case V6 (sample V7176436), only had a single basic amino acid at the variable site in 2 C although it appeared to have evolved from the 2015 cluster viruses with 2 basic amino acids. All but one of the Victorian sequences were collected from patients between August and October 2017. The majority of cases from NSW were sampled between November 2017 and January 2018, and this represented the peak of the epidemic in that state to when case numbers started to decrease (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The single ACT sequence (V9) was from a sample taken in October 2017.
