<p id="Par32">cDNA from samples was amplified using the Ion Ampliseq™ Library Kit 2.0 (Thermofisher Scientific, Victoria, Australia) and a custom Ampliseq™ primer panel designed based on the sequences of HPeV3 from the 2013 and 2015 HPeV outbreaks as previously described

 </sup>. The protocol was performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions except that 35 PCR cycles were used instead of 30 cycles, and the amplicons from the two primer pools were not combined until after quantification. Library quantification was performed using the Ion Library TaqMan™ Quantification Kit (Thermofisher Scientific).
