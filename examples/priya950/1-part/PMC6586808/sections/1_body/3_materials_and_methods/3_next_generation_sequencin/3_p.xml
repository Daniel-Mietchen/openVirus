<p id="Par34">When regions with low read coverage (&lt;5 reads) were encountered, specific primers were designed and the region sequenced by Sanger sequencing using the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit as per manufacturer’s instructions and a Hitachi 3500XL Genetic sequencer (Thermofisher Scientific). Primers used for Sanger sequencing are provided in Supplementary Table
