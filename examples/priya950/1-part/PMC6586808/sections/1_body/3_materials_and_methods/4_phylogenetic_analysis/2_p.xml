 </sup> was used to estimate the nucleotiode substitution rate per site per year and the time to the most recent ancestor. The age of each virus was defined as the date of collection. Given the small sample size, the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model

 </sup> with a gamma-distributed rate amongst sites was selected. A constant coalescent population and a relaxed clock were used for analysis. Two independent runs using a chain length of 50 million, and sampling every 1000 simulation were conducted for each of the polyprotein, capsid and non-structural gene analyses. The convergence and effective sample size (ESS) of each estimate was checked using Tracer 1.7.1
