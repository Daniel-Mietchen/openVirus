 </sup>. These techniques are more accessible in terms of equipment and cost, but still require a complex downstream bioinformatics analysis which may represent a cumbersome step demanding a specific expertise. On the other hand, resequencing microarray do not demand a sophisticated analysis for interpretation. Indeed, the sequence obtained following hybridization of the amplified genetic material on the chip is used without any intermediate step for both BLASTN enquiry and phylogenetic analysis. Although the random amplification does not allow to specifically concentrate the viral material present in the specimen compared to classic or multiplex PCR assays, the following hybridization step on the resequencing microarray further improves the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay. In addition, the assay has the advantage of tolerating critical divergence levels, up to 20%, permitting a precise characterization from a short stretch of about 20 detected nt

Several steps of the assay can be performed in the field (mobile laboratory) including sample preparation, random amplification by Phy29 (stable at room temperature) up to hybridization on the microarray. A specific equipment (fluidic station/scanner) is only required for the post-hybridization analysis and scanning.
