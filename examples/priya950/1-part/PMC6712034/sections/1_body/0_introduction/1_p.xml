<p id="Par2">Hantaviruses are enveloped tri-segmented negative-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Hantaviridae</italic> family, 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order, according to the 2018 classification of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)

 </sup>. Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide, their animal reservoirs are rodents, insectivores or bats (orders Rodentia, Soricomorpha, Chiroptera). When rodent-borne orthohantaviruses are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of infected rodent reservoirs, they can provoke Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS), its mild form Nephropathia Epidemica (NE), or Hantavirus Cardio-Pulmonary Syndrome (HCPS), mainly depending on the virus species and its genotype/strain. In Europe, cases of HFRS associated with 
 <italic>Dobrava-Belgrade orthohantavirus</italic> (DOBV) and 
 <italic>Seoul orthohantavirus</italic> (SEOV), and cases of NE associated with 
 <italic>Puumala orthohantavirus</italic> (PUUV), are continuously reported in endemic areas such as the Balkans, the Fennoscandia region, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, France, and more recently, United Kingdom

 </sup>. Tools to investigate the genetic diversity of hantaviruses in their animal reservoirs along their geographical distribution are particularly needed to better understand the epidemiology and predict hantavirus disease outbreaks in humans, and to set up appropriate public health measures
