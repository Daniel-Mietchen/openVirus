<p id="Par5">Therefore, the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> generation resequencing microarray (PathogenID v3.0), employed in the present cooperative study at the European scale has been specialized for virus detection and contains more than 800 viral sequences. This pan-viral resequencing microarray covers many viral pathogens critical for both animal and public health and in particular most of the known circulating species and variants of zoonotic viruses. Among those sequences, 52 were strategically chosen to cover the diversity of hantaviruses, in particular the most frequent rodent-borne species that are the only one reported today to have a zoonotic potential. The small (S) segment of the genome encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein was chosen as target to design the probes since there are more efficient to discriminate variants within a species; in addition more reference sequences were present in GenBank at the moment of the pan-viral chip conception.
