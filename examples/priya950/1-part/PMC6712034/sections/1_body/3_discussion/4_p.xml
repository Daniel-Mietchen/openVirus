<p id="Par41">Identification of European hantaviruses, PUUV, DOBV, TULV, SEOV, TOPV present in tissue samples or in supernatants of Vero E6 cells infected with laboratory strains was demonstrated not only using the homologous sequences tiled on the chip, but also using phylogenetically distant sequences (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The key factor for the precise characterization of the tested hantavirus sequence was obviously its genetic distance from the tiled one (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) outlining the importance of designing the chip from sequences encompassing the global diversity of hantaviruses. However, even for samples with a low Call Rate (CR: % of determined/total number of nucleotides following hybridization), precise taxonomical identification was possible when short specific fragments of significant sequence (about 15 nucleotides) were obtained for BLASTN analysis (Supplement 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). This was in particular the case for TOPV and PUUV Konnevesi variant in the present study (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). A similar observation was previously reported for hemorrhagic fever viruses detected by PathogenID v.2
