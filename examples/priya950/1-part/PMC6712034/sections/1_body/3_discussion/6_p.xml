<p id="Par43">Altogether, the results obtained with DOBV, TULV, SEOV and TOPV clearly outline the potential of Pathogen ID v3.0 to largely explore the hantavirus genetic space and to deliver precise identification of the species and local variants present in the infected tissue or in the cell supernatant. The suitability of this approach was demonstrated to map the wide diversity of hantaviruses within the European continent, including new variants unknown at the moment of the design of the chip. Detection by resequencing microarray which is applicable to both animal and human samples, is of interest for both research and public health aspects. Our results are promising to enlarge evaluation to other hantaviruses from different continents, both the pathogenic ones circulating in other endemic areas, such as Americas where they provoke severe HCPS and also in other animal reservoirs such as insectivores and bats.</p>
