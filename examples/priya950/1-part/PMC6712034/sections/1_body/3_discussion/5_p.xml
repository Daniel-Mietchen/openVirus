 </sup>, was also precisely characterized despite neither Lyon nor Cherwell isolates, respectively, were known when the microarray was designed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Interestingly, both isolates were detected and correctly identified from two heterologous sequences tiled on the microarray, SEOV and HTNV (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). In any cases, when a tiled sequence did not achieve the determination of the exact geographical variant, it was at least designing the phylogenetic clade and the number of sequences tiled on the microarray always allowed to reach the deepest level of precision (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
