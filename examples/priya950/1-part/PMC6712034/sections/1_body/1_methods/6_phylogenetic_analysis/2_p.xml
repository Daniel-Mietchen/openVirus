<p id="Par27">Firstly, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the complete coding part of reference sequences by the maximum-likehood method (ML) with PhyML v3.0, implemented in Seaview (v.4.6.1) under the most appropriate nucleotide substitution model as determined by SMS program (available online at

 </sup>. Branch supports were evaluated by approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT SH-Like). Then, short sequences of the chips and of tested hantaviruses were placed in this backbone tree using RAxML available online on the CIPRES portal at (

Branch supports of these phylogenetic placements were evaluated by the rapid bootstrap procedure with MRE-based Bootstopping criterion as highly recommended on the online software version.
