<p id="Par10">Synthetic plasmids containing the S segment of PUUV, the most endemic hantavirus in Europe (strain Sotkamo 2009), HTNV (strain 76/118), TULV (strain Moravia) were used in a preliminary assay to evaluate the potential of the microarray for hantavirus detection, prior testing the field animal samples. PUUV plasmid was taken as reference and tested alone and in pool with the HNTV and TULV plasmids.</p>
