<p id="Par7">The objective for the conception of the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> generation resequencing microarray (PathogenID v3.0) was to reach the widest coverage in virus diversity of both medical and veterinarian interest. Due to the technical limits of the microarray, we selected the minimum number of probes for each viral species/variant, in order to include the highest number of sequences. For each viral family, the included probes were chosen taking into account the reference sequences published in GenBank and our experience from the earlier generations of the microarray (PathogenID v1.0 and PathogenID v2.0)
