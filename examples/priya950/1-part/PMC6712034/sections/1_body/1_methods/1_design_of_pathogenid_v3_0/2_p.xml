<p id="Par8">PathogenID v3.0 contains 838 sequences including virus prototypes and their variants belonging to different families (complete list available upon request to the authors). Regarding hantaviruses, 52 N protein encoding S segment partial sequences were included (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Supplement 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), according to the known ICTV taxonomy in force when we designed the chip (e.g. choice of the probe sequences). The length of the tiled sequences was: i) 425 nucleotides (nt) for those available in GenBank, with the exception of seq234 (251 nt); ii) 303 nt for those sequenced in the laboratory during previous analyses and not published at the moment of the study (Table

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).
