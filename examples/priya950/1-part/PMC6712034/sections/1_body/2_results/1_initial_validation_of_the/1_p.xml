<p id="Par29">The performance in hantavirus detection and genetic characterization of the resequencing chip Pathogen ID v3.0 was first evaluated using plasmids encoding prototype hantavirus sequences (PUUV, HTNV, TULV). The PUUV plasmid encompassing the N protein coding region (1831 nt) of the reference Sotkamo strain 2009 was hybridized to Pathogen ID v3.0 which includes 22 PUUV S segment sequences (seq222 to seq243) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Supplement 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). For each of these sequences, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> summarizes (i) the calculated sequence similarity (%) with the tested PUUV Sotkamo strain sequence; (ii) the percentage of correctly identified nucleotides (CR) following its hybridization to the chip and (iii) the result of the BLASTN analysis performed with the obtained raw sequences (Supplement 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).
