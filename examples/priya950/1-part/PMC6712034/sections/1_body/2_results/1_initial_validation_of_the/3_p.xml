<p id="Par31">We verified that simultaneous detection was possible when plasmids containing the N protein coding region of the three hantavirus reference strains (PUUV Sotkamo 2009, TULV Moravia, HTNV 76/118) were mixed in pool (Supplement 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The CR values of PUUV output sequences (seq222–seq243) were even higher (e.g. more determined nucleotides) for the pool of the three viruses, most likely due to cross-contribution from the three viruses in hybridizing the same sequence tiled on the chip, thus producing better results in BLASTN analysis (Supplements
