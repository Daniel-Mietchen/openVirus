<p id="Par37">For DOBV, RNA extracts from two cell supernatants infected with reference laboratory strains Belgrade and Saaremaa and RNA extracts from two Yellow-necked mice from Slovenia were tested (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). All of them were exactly characterized: (1) by the DOBV (seq245-seq246) and/or SAAV (seq247) sequences tiled on the chip, as expected from the genetic similarity of both viruses; (2) more interestingly, by tiled sequences from more distant orthohantavirus species such as HTNV and Soochong virus. Significant results were also observed for TULV RNA extracts from one laboratory strain and three Common vole samples from Germany, Finland and Slovenia (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Following BLASTN, the correct sequence was either exclusively or at least dominantly characterized. Here again, precise detection and identification was possible with tiled sequences from very distant clades of vole-associated New world orthohantaviruses such as Prospect Hill or Sin Nombre orthohantaviruses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Finally the SEOV present in RNA extracts from Norway rats from France and UK, although unknown when the chip was designed, was perfectly identified by heterologous SEOV tiled sequences (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Similarly for RNA extracts from a TOPV laboratory strain, in absence of the corresponding sequence tiled on the chip, the exact characterization was achieved with PUUV tiled sequences (seq228, seq234, seq325) even at low CR of 15% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>).
