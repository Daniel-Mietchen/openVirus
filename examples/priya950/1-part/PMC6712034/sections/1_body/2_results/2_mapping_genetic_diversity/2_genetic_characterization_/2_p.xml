<p id="Par34">The French Ardennes PUUV lung-derived variants 87 and 153 were precisely identified by BLASTN not only using the very homologous French Ardennes PUUV tiled sequences (seq237-seq241), but also with tiled sequences from Belgium (seq222-seq223, seq230) or even from North-West Germany (seq229 for variant 153) more distant phylogenetically within the Central European (CE) clade. With the same logic, the three PUUV variants from Germany were precisely characterized by 91% (10/11; Gilserberg), 84% (5/6; Weissach) and 50% (3/6; Bramsche) of the hybridizing homologous and heterologous tiled sequences from the Central European clade (TableÂ

More interestingly, the Konnevesi variant from Finland was exactly identified not only with tiled sequences from its specific clade (Finland, FIN) but also from the Central European (CE) clade. Equally, the variant 8098 from Slovenia (clade Alpes-Adrian, ALAD) was exactly identified with sequences from the ALAD clade, and also from the CE, FIN and Russia (RUS) clades. Finally, the laboratory PUUV Sotkamo strain was systematically identified by tiled sequences from almost all clades of the PUUV phylogenetic tree.
