<p id="Par35">It is of note that these very precise characterisations could be obtained despite very low CR values, for example down to only 13% of defined nucleotides between the tested PUUV variant Slovenia 8098 and the tiled seq226 (Kazan_Z84204) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). It is explained by the exact determination of short fragments (stretches) of significant sequence (e.g. minimum of 15 nucleotides) that allow precise BLASTN identification despite poor CR values (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Supplement 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).
