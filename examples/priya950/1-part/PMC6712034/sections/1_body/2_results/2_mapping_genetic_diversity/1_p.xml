<p id="Par32">The same technology validated with plasmids encoding hantavirus N protein was applied to tissue samples of PUUV, TULV, DOBV, SAAV, SEOV, TOPV infected rodents originating from different endemic areas in Europe as well as to supernatants of cells infected with laboratory strains (Tables

 </sup> we first observed that, at comparable viral RNA titer (Ct value), lung was more performing for hantavirus investigation on the chip (data not shown). Therefore, lung derived RNAs were priorized for further investigation.
