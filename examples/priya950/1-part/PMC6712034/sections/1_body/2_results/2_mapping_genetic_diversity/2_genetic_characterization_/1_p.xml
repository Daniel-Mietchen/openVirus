<p id="Par33">RNA extracts from supernatant of Vero E6 cells infected with the PUUV Sotkamo strain, and RNA extracts from lungs of seven PUUV-infected bank voles originating from France, Germany, Finland or Slovenia were individually hybridized to the 22 PUUV sequences (seq222 to seq243) tiled on the PathogenID v3.0 resequencing microarray. It is of note that only two of the tested samples had their exact sequence tiled on the chip: the PUUV Sotkamo strain (seq225) and the French Ardennes PUUV strain 87 (seq237). When a significant signal was detected, the corresponding raw sequence was subjected to BLASTN enquiry for genetic typing (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> pictures the results in the context of a phylogenetic tree illustrating the currently known diversity of PUUV by combining references sequences available in GenBank, sequences tiled on the chip (in red) and sequences of the tested viruses (in green). An unequivocal determination of the correct geographical variant was observed for all the tested samples at least with one tiled sequence (red dots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), even when the corresponding sequence was not tiled itself on the chip. In very few cases (&lt;8%, orange dots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) tiled sequences designated only an approximate origin, however always in the same genetic cluster.
