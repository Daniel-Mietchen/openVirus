  <p>Cooperative work for genetic characterization study of endemic hantaviruses in Europe. Hantaviruses from rodents: Bank vole (
   <italic>Myodes glareolus</italic>), Common vole (
   <italic>Microtus arvalis</italic>), Yellow-necked mouse (
   <italic>Apodemus flavicolis</italic>), Striped field mouse (
   <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic>), and Norway rat (
   <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>) captured in different endemic areas in Europe were genetically characterized using a resequencing pan-viral chip during a cooperative work among European research institutes: France, Germany, Scandinavia, Balkans, United Kingdom. Laboratory viral strains were also obtained from one of the participant laboratory. The tested RNA included: (i) RNA extracted from tissues (e.g. lung) originating from infected wild rodents; (ii) RNA extracted from supernatants from inoculated cells (Vero E6).
