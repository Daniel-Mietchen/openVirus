  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of European Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) genetically characterised by PathogenID v3.0 resequencing microarray. A phylogenetic tree backbone was first constructed from complete S segment coding sequences of reference hantaviruses available in GenBank using the maximum-likelihood method (ML) with PhyML v3.0, implemented in Seaview (v.4.6.1) with the most appropriate substitution model as determined by SMS program. Shorter sequences (tiled on the chip &amp; tested viruses) were then placed in the backbone tree using RaxML. Nodes with branch support values &gt; 0.8 are indicated by a red point (reference tree, aLRT branch support test) or by a blue point (phylogenetic placement of short sequence in the reference tree, rapid bootstrap procedure with MRE-based Bootstopping criterion). Scale bar represents the average number of substitutions per site. Under the tree are indicated the main geographical clusters of PUUV in Europe: CE (Central Europe); ALAD (Alpes-Adrian); S-SCA (South Scandinavia); FIN (Finland); RUS (Russia); LAT (Latvia); N-SCA (North Scandinavia); DEN (Denmark). The 22 PUUV sequences fixed on the chip (seq222 to seq243) are outlined in red, those of the 8 tested viruses in green. In the upper grid, the 8 tested Puumala viruses (the laboratory PUUV Sotkamo strain and 7 European geographical variants) are presented with: their exact position in the tree (green diamond); the tiled sequences having permitted their detection (significant CR) with exact (red circles) or close (orange circles) genetic identification by BLASTN.
