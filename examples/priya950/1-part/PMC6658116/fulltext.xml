Naturally occurring isolates with altered E protein glycosylation patterns have been observed in WNV isolates; however, the specific effects of these polymorphisms on avian host pathogenesis and vector competence have not been investigated before. In the present study, amino acid polymorphisms, NYT, NYP, NYF, SYP, SYS, KYS and deletion (A&#x02019;DEL), were reverse engineered into a parental WNV (NYS) cDNA infectious clone to generate WNV glycosylation mutant viruses. These WNV glycosylation mutant viruses were characterized for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth, pH-sensitivity, temperature-sensitivity and host competence in American crows (AMCR), house sparrows (HOSP) and <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. The NYS and NYT glycosylated viruses showed higher viral replication, and lower pH and temperature sensitivity than NYP, NYF, SYP, SYS, KYS and A&#x02019;DEL viruses <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>in vivo</italic> results demonstrated asymmetric effects in avian and mosquito competence that were independent of the E-protein glycosylation status. In AMCRs and HOSPs, all viruses showed comparable viremias with the exception of NYP and KYS viruses that showed attenuated phenotypes. Only NYP showed reduced vector competence in both <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> and <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>tarsalis</italic>. Glycosylated NYT exhibited similar avian virulence properties as NYS, but resulted in higher mosquito oral infectivity than glycosylated NYS and nonglycosylated, NYP, NYF, SYP and KYS mutants. These data demonstrated that amino acid polymorphisms at E154/156 dictate differential avian host and vector competence phenotypes independent of E-protein glycosylation status.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>West Nile virus (WNV) has been responsible for the largest human encephalitis epidemics in the continental United States.

The envelope (E) protein for WNV contains a variable N-linked glycosylation motif which influences avian replication, mosquito infectivity and vector competence. WNV isolates with variable E protein glycosylation motifs that have been historically associated with human cases of disease, were selected to generate WNV glycosylation mutant viruses via reverse genetics.

The data demonstrated that N-linked glycosylation was not as crucial for WNV transmission and host competence as previously reported.

First isolated in 1937 from a febrile patient in the West Nile district of northern Uganda[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the virus is now known to circulate in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Australia[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. WNV is a member of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family and is closely related to other human pathogens such as Japanese encephalitis (JEV), Saint Louis encephalitis and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses within the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) serocomplex[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The natural reservoir/amplification hosts of WNV are avian species with <italic>Culex spp</italic>. mosquitoes serving as the primary vectors for enzootic transmission[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Humans and most mammals are incidental hosts in the natural transmission cycle as they do not develop sufficiently high viremias to be infectious for mosquitoes.</p><p>WNV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is transcribed and translated in one open reading frame[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There are three structural proteins, capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), envelope (E), and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 that are translated and released after host and viral protease cleavage in the cytoplasm[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The prM-E proteins influence efficiency of virus infection, viral particle maturation and virus release[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The prM is cleaved from the E protein during virus replication and assembly, allowing the E proteins to dimerize and create a lattice-like structure around mature WNV virus particles during viral maturation and release[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The E protein facilitates cell attachment, allowing virus entry into the cell via the endosomal pathway[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Both the prM and E proteins contain N-linked glycosylation sites; however, only the prM N-linked glycosylation site is highly conserved among WNV isolates[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The WNV E protein N-linked glycosylation motif (asparagine-tyrosine-serine/threonine; N-Y-S/T) lies between amino acid (aa) positions 154&#x02013;156 and exists in forms predicted to be glycosylated and not glycosylated with the site completely absent in some strains due to a four amino acid deletion across this motif[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The N-linked glycosylation motif is present in most WNV strains that have been isolated during significant outbreaks of human disease both in North America and globally (<xref rid="pntd.0007473.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Glycosylation of the WNV E protein has been previously implicated as an important viral genetic element for flavivirus virulence and pathogenesis and has been associated with enhanced growth in mammalian, avian and mosquito cells[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and a murine neuroinvasive phenotype[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with higher viremia and increased avian pathogenicity[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]<sub>.</sub> WNV virus-like particles (VLPs) with mutations that prevent glycosylation at the envelope motif, in contrast, have been associated with reduced particle production in mosquito, mammalian and avian cells however, VLPs lacking envelope glycosylation exhibited higher infectivity rates in mosquito cells compared to VLPs with glycosylated E proteins[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In other studies, a non-glycosylated NYI mutant virus demonstrated reduced transmissibility following oral exposure of <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> and reversion at the glycosylation motif was commonly identified in saliva samples of the orally exposed <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic>. Similarly, oral infectivity of the parental glycosylated WNV was found to infect <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> more efficiently than the NYI mutant [<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

In this study, we investigated WNV viral replication, WNV-vector interactions, avian virulence and vector competence of variable amino acid polymorphisms at the E-154 or E-156 loci that resulted in predicted glycosylated (NYS, NYT) and non-glycosylated E proteins (NYP, NYF, SYS, SYP, KYS and A&#x02019;DEL). We demonstrate the novel finding that the amino acid identity at either E-154 or E-156 modulated WNV viral growth, avian virulence and vector competence independent of the predicted glycosylation of WNV-E protein.</p><p>In previous reports, WNV mutants with abolished E-protein glycosylation such as NYF[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], QYS[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and AYS[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] exhibited attenuated <italic>in vitro</italic> viral growth profiles in comparison to NYS whereas mutants representing NYS to IYS[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], NYE or NYP[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], were reported to have a minimal impact on viral growth in C6/36 cells. Other groups have reported that mutating NYS to QYS resulted in strikingly higher levels of infectivity in mosquito cells but lower virus production when compared with NYS[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These previous reports focused on ablation of glycosylation and did not specifically assess the effect of the actual amino acid identity at E-154/ E-156 on phenotype. The results presented herein have demonstrated that introduction of amino acid polymorphisms at either E-154 or E-156 differentially modulated WNV growth in C6/36 cells. Although many of the nonglycosylated WNVs showed an increased sensitivity to low pH, they all grew quite well in Vero, HD11 and DEF cells at 37&#x000b0;C. Interestingly, although temperature sensitivity at 44&#x000b0;C has been associated with lessened avian virulence phenotypes of other WNV variants/mutants[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], many of the nonglycosylated WNV mutants (NYF and SYS) that were highly sensitive for growth at elevated avian temperatures <italic>in vitro</italic> demonstrated high viremia levels in AMCRs (NYF and SYS) or HOSPs (NYF). These data indicate that amino acid polymorphisms in this region of the E protein, although impacting temperature sensitivity do not necessarily alter avian host competence phenotypes. Previous work has demonstrated nonstructural genetic determinants to be positively correlated with both temperature sensitivity and avian host competence phenotypes[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], indicating that structural determinants of temperature sensitivity observed herein could be dictated by factors unrelated to avian competence.</p><p>Unlike previous studies in which the growth of WNV mutants in AMCR monocytes predicted viremia potential and virulence[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], all viruses grew relatively well in chicken (HD11) monocytes herein, indicating fundamental differences in the relative utility for avian cells from alternative avian sources with lessened susceptibility (chickens) to WNV to model avian virulence phenotypes in highly susceptible birds (AMCRs). In previous reports, HD11 cells had demonstrated restricted growth for a Mexican isolate of WNV lacking a glycosylation motif (NYP) with limited avian virulence potential in AMCRs[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The attenuated phenotype was subsequently attributed to both the NYP mutation in addition to a prM mutation and full attenuation effects were observed in the presence of both mutations in AMCRs, HOSPs and House finches[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Significantly lower viral loads in young chicks inoculated with a non-glycosylated (NYP) WNV plaque variant when compared to glycosylated (NYS) WNV have also been reported[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] leading the investigators to ascribe the phenotypic differences to the loss of glycosylation; however, other sequence alterations in the plaque variants and the specific effect of the amino acid polymorphism, independent of glycosylation, could mediate these phenotypes. Herein, the most significantly debilitated phenotypes in AMCRs were observed in birds inoculated with the KYS and NYP mutants that both lacked glycosylation signals but were imparted by different mutations within the glycosylation signal sequence. Alternative mutations that also ablated glycosylation by different amino acid substitutions at these same loci, SYS/NYF, had minor effects on avian viremia potential in AMCRs. Similar observations were made with HOSPs with the exception of the SYS mutant which showed an attenuated viremia much like KYS and NYP.As potential further support of the role of the amino acid identity at these positions for dictating phenotypes independent of glycosylation status, it is intriguing that both mutants that showed the most significant mosquito and avian competence differences KYS and NYP also encoded the most non-conservative amino acid substitutions. These consisted of a polar, uncharged asparagine substituted with a positively charged lysine (E-N154K) or a polar uncharged serine substituted with an aromatic ringed, hydrophobic proline (E-S156P) for KYS and NYP mutants, respectively.</p><p>The specific amino acid identity at the E-156 locus influenced mosquito oral infectivity independent of glycosylation status as the NYT virus had a higher infection rate than NYS. The NYP mutant exhibited a severely debilitated infection and dissemination phenotype while the NYF did not significantly affect these phenotypes compared to the NYS virus. The E-154 locus showed similar variable effects on vector competence with restricted infectivity of the KYS mutant observed when compared to the SYS mutant. With the exception of the NYP mutant virus, absence of E protein glycosylation did not significantly attenuate viral growth, infection and/or dissemination rates of NYF, SYS, SYP and KYS viruses when compared with NYS parental WNV in <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic>. Even after bypassing the midgut barrier of infection by intrathoracic inoculation, NYP produced significantly lower viral titers in the saliva. The attenuated profile of NYP virus in <italic>Culex</italic> spp. in the present study could explain the low frequency of isolation of WNV-NYP in nature[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While NYP avian serum titers could presumably overcome WNV oral infection thresholds[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] in highly competent avian hosts[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], AMCRs elicited lower serum viremias with this virus. Furthermore, the restricted dissemination and transmission in alternative mosquito vectors such as <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>tarsalis</italic> could preclude subsequent transmission. In contrast to our study, Murata et al reported the isolation and characterization of a small plaque variant with the NYP motif where no oral infectivity differences were observed with <italic>Culex pipiens pallens</italic> and disseminated viral titers were indistinguishable between the NYS and NYP viruses[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Alternative mosquito species used and viral genetic differences between the NYP viruses used in the two studies could explain the difference in results. Of note, the SYP virus that was generated as a double mutant to prevent reversion to glycosylated motif as well as to assess the duplicative effect of altering more than one amino acid within the motif did not exhibit an attenuated mosquito infection phenotype as observed for NYP. The additional E-154 mutation could have served to compensate for negative fitness effects of the E-S156P substitution possibly through structural modulation of the envelope surface projections. The lack of significant differences between NYS and NYF, SYS, SYP and KYS viruses suggests that WNV N-linked glycosylation is not a critical determinant of vector competence. The WN02 genotype that displaced the introduced WNV-NY99 genotype, is characterized principally by the incorporation of a nonsynonymous valine to alanine substitution at position E-159[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This new genotype has been reported to exhibit a shorter extrinsic incubation period in certain <italic>Culex</italic> spp. and more efficient transmission rates at warmer temperatures[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This E-159 locus, similar to the E-154-156 motif, is present on the surface of the mature envelope protein and could indicate that numerous amino acid variants in this surface exposed envelope domain could significantly modulate vector competence phenotypes. Taken together, the data indicated that specific amino acid identities at E154 or E-156 and potential other sites on the WNV E protein could be critical for modulation of mosquito oral infectivity and vector competence exclusive of the glycosylation status of the E protein.</p><p>Interestingly, the midgut infection rate for NYT (70%) was more than twice that of the NYS virus (34%), indicating that a single amino acid polymorphism at E-156 that maintained glycosylation status of the E protein could result in a significant effect on vector competence. Nevertheless, the role of glycosylation for modulation of this phenotype between these viruses cannot be discounted as <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with recombinant rabies virus glycoproteins have shown that differential glycosylation efficiencies of the N-linked moieties were dependent upon the hydroxyl amino acid in the glycosylation motif[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. That study also showed that NYT motifs were preferentially and more efficiently glycosylated than the NYS motif[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus it is possible that higher glycosylation efficiency of NYT versus NYS potentially enhanced virus entry, release and/or subsequent infection rates in mosquitoes in the present study[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. That being said, while the infection rate for NYT was significantly higher than NYS, NYT viral titers, dissemination and transmission rates remained similar to NYS. While no naturally occurring NYT WNV variants have been described, other flaviviruses such as Zika (NDT), dengue (NET), Wesselbron (NHT), Sepik (NHT), Rocio (NYT), Spondweni (NDT) and Ilheus (NYT) viruses have been shown to encode a threonine at the hydroxyl amino acid of the N-linked glycosylation motif[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Other flaviviruses such as Yellow fever virus and St. Louis encephalitis viruses do not encode a glycosylated E protein[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Furthermore, non-glycosylated SLEV maintains a lower oral infection threshold, i.e. has been shown to be more infectious, in <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes when compared with WNV[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], again demonstrating that the N-linked glycosylation is not a requisite for flavivirus infection of and transmission by mosquitoes. Reports by others have also demonstrated variable vector competence rates with non-glycosylated WNV isolates[<xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and in this study, with the exception of NYP and A&#x02019;DEL all other non-glycosylated viruses were transmitted by <italic>Cx quinquefasciatus</italic>. The effect of the different E154-156 mutations on avian viremia potential was variable and species-specific, indicating that different mutations could be competent for avian viremia generation in certain avian species. Despite having delayed viremia onset, even the A&#x02019;DEL mutant was capable of eliciting avian viremia conducive for mosquito infection, although this mutant failed to demonstrate transmissibility in <italic>Cx quinquefasciatus</italic>. Data presented herein indicates that WNV E154-156 motif amino identity, rather than specific N-linked glycosylation, dictates acute viral titers in birds and vector competence in mosquitoes and the effect of a particular E154-156 moiety expressed on WNV avian and vector competence was species-dependent. The isolation of many of these E-154-156 mutants in the field is intriguing and coupled with the findings here indicates the strong possibility that non-glycosylated WNV variants could circulate at relatively high frequency. The frequency of WNV genotypes to express a particular E-glycosylation motif (E154-E156) is likely due to selection pressures on viral replicative fitness by the dominant amplification host(s) and vectors utilized during local transmission events. Future studies should be designed to assess the potential fitness advantages for these variants in specific enzootic vectors and/or hosts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. David C.
