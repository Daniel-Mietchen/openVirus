 <p>West Nile virus (WNV) has been responsible for the largest human encephalitis epidemics in the continental United States. Avians and 
  <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes are the primary hosts for WNV natural transmission cycles. The envelope (E) protein for WNV contains a variable N-linked glycosylation motif which influences avian replication, mosquito infectivity and vector competence. WNV isolates with variable E protein glycosylation motifs that have been historically associated with human cases of disease, were selected to generate WNV glycosylation mutant viruses via reverse genetics. Replication capacity and host competence of WNV glycosylation mutant viruses were compared 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> in American crows, house sparrows and 
  <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. The data demonstrated that N-linked glycosylation was not as crucial for WNV transmission and host competence as previously reported. Rather the amino acid identities of the glycosylation motif were more important in dictating WNV virulence phenotypes in both avian and mosquito host.
