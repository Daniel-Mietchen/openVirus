   <italic>In vitro</italic> characterization of WNV glycosylation mutant viruses.
  </title>
  <p>(A) Plaque morphology of WNV mutants on Vero cells at 3 dpi and sequenced across the E154-156 motif. Arrows designate genetic loci modified by sire-directed mutagenesis. (B) Endoglycosidase digestion (Endo F) was used to assess presence/ absence of WNV envelope protein glycosylation. Purified E proteins were digested with Endoglycosidase F, Endo F (+), or left undigested Endo F (-). Migration rates of the E proteins were determined by resolving the viral proteins on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel and performing a Western blot with the WNV E-glycoprotein specific monoclonal antibody, 3.67G. (C) Plaque diameters were measured (mm) from five representative plaques from each glycosylation mutant virus (D)Virus growth was assessed in Vero cells with the WNV parental virus and mutants at an MOI of 0. 1. The Limit of Detection (LOD) shown by dashed line. (E) The parental strain and WNV glycosylation mutants were diluted to 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/well and exposed to varying pH ranges (5.8–7.0) at 0.2 pH unit increments in triplicate for 10 minutes. The pH was immediately brought to a neutral condition (pH 7.4) by the addition of sterile PBS. Viral titers of pH- treated samples were determined via plaque assay, reported in log
   <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL and plotted as a function of the pH treatment.
