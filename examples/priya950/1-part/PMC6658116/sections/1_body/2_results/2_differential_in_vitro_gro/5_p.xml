<p>Temperature sensitivity in avian cells has previously been associated with differential avian host competence[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As such, DEF cells growth phenotypes of the WNV mutants were assessed at 37°C/44°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). All WNVs grew to titers &gt;8 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL at 37°C; however, differences in growth were apparent at 44°C. Glycosylated viruses manifested mean titers of &gt;7 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL supernatant at the elevated temperature; however, NYP, NYF, SYS, SYP and A’DEL mutants all grew to mean peak viral titers of only approximately 5.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL supernatant at 44°C, demonstrating a &gt;50-fold higher temperature sensitivity than NYS/NYT. In contrast, KYS failed to grow above 4 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL supernatant at the elevated temperature, demonstrating &gt;30,000-fold lower titer at 44°C than at 37°C compared to approximately a 100-fold and 1000-fold temperature sensitivity phenotype of NYS/NYT and alternative E-154-56 mutants, respectively.
