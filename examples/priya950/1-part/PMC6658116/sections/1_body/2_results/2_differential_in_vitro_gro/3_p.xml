<p>Similar to results in Vero cells, growth of the glycosylated viruses, NYS and NYT, in C6/36 cells was statistically indistinguishable, reaching daily mean titer of 5.5 ± 0.1 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL by 4 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Both NYS/NYT WNVs produced significantly higher titers (p&lt;0.05) than NYP, NYF, SYS, SYP and KYS, between 1–4 dpi. All nonglycosylated mutants exhibited a delay in the detection of virus until 2 dpi. From 2–4 dpi, NYP, NYF, SYS, SYP and KYS titers were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than NYS and NYT by 100-1000-fold. Titers for KYS were initially detected at 3 dpi and exhibited the most significantly retarded (p&lt;0.05) growth in C6/36 cells in comparison with the other WNV mutants. Serial passaging was performed to assess genetic stability of the E protein glycosylation motif. After five serial passages in C6/36 cells, the NYS, NYT, NYP, NYF, SYP and KYS viruses were found to have retained the introduced mutations. One replicate of the third passage of SYS showed a mixed population phenotype at both positions E-154 and E-156. The E-154 codon showed nucleotide changes from AGC (Ser) to AAC/T (Asn)/A(Lys) and codon E-156 showed changes from TCC (Ser) to T/CCC (Ser/Pro).
