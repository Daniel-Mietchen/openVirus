<p>Since glycosylation of the E154-156 motif has been associated with differential protein stability that could be critical under low pH conditions in which the E protein is exposed within the endocytic vesicle, the assessment of infectivity was performed under an acidic pH range[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Both glycosylated variants (NYS/NYT) maintained infectious mean viral titers that were within 3-fold of the pretreatment mean viral titer at pH ranges of 6.6â€“7.0. The non-glycosylated NYF mutant similarly exhibited a 3-fold drop in mean viral titer within this same pH range. In contrast, the NYP, KYS and SYS mutants all showed approximately 10-fold reductions in infectious titers at pH 6.6 versus 7.0.
