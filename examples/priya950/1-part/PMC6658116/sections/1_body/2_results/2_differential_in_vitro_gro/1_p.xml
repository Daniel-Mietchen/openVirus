<p>Growth profiles of glycosylation competent viruses (NYS, NYT) were indistinguishable in Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), with both NYS (9.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL) and NYT (9.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL) viruses reaching peak viral titers at 2 dpi (p&gt;0.1). The nonglycosylated (SYS, NYP and KYS) mutants exhibited mean viral titers that were at least 5-fold lower than the glycosylated parental virus at 2 dpi (p&lt;0.005) and reached indistinguishable mean peak viral titers compared to the glycosylated NYS virus by 3 dpi (p&gt;0.5). The NYF mutant showed a more significant growth restriction in Vero cells, with an ~50-fold reduction in titer compared to the NYS virus in Vero cells at 2 dpi (p&lt;0.0005). Furthermore, the mean peak titer at 3 dpi was also at least 5-fold lower than either the NYS or NYT viruses (p&lt;0.009).
