<p>No significant differences in the mean viral titers of positive mosquito bodies were observed for

 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> orally exposed to NYS/NYT viruses; however, mean body titers of both NYT and NYS exposed 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) than NYP (
