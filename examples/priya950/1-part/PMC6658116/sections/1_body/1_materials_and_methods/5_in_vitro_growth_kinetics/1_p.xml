<p>Vero, HD11, DEF and C6/36 cells were inoculated in triplicate with each virus at an MOI of 0.1. Viral titers were determined via a standard plaque assay on Vero cells and these titers were used to calculate MOIs for all 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> growth kinetics experiments. Media was removed from the cells and 200μL of diluted virus was added to each well after which the cells were allowed to incubate with the virus at 28°C (C6/36 cells) or 37°C (all other cell lines) for one hour. After the incubation, cells were washed twice with DPBS and fresh media added to each well. The plates were incubated at the designated temperature (including up to 44°C for high temperature DEF cell assessments) through 4 dpi. 50μL of supernatant aliquots were harvested every 24 hours from each well and added to 450μL of DMEM supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS. Samples were stored at -80°C until processed. Growth kinetics for each virus was determined by standard plaque assay on Vero cells. Viral titers were averaged, reported in log-based plaque-forming units/ mL and plotted by hpi.
