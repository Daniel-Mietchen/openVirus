<p>For all negative samples, the LOD value was used for all statistical evaluations. One-way ANOVA tests were used to assess differences in mean peak viremia in AMCRs and HOSPs as well as between titers at various time points between mutant viruses in Vero, DEF, C6/36 and HD11 cells and plaque sizes. Tukey’s HSD adjustment for multiple comparisons were utilized for assessing mean differences. Pair-wise Fisher’s exact tests were used to analyze differences in infection, dissemination and transmission rates of each mutant virus compared to the parental glycosylated NYS WNV in mosquitoes.</p>
