<p>In order to assess the stability of the E protein N-linked glycosylation motif in cell culture, serial passaging was performed in C6/36 cells. All viruses were passaged five times in C6/36 cells. Cells were initially inoculated in triplicate at an MOI of 0.01. Media was removed, virus was added and allowed to adsorb for one hour. After the absorption period, cells were washed twice with DPBS, after which fresh media was added. Cells were allowed to incubate for 7 dpi., after which supernatant was harvested, diluted 1:10 and added to a new flask of cells. This process was repeated for five passages. All viruses were harvested at 7 days post-infection (dpi) at which point RNA was extracted using a Qiagen Viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription was performed using primer WNV4129R (5’ TTGAGGCTAGAGCCAAGCATAGCAG 3’) and Superscript II (Invitrogen, CA). Generated cDNA was diluted 100-fold and then used in PCR reactions with
