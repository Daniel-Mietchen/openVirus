<p>Assembly and rescue of the WNV infectious clone derived virus (WNV.IC) has been described previously[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Site-directed mutagenesis primers (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were designed based on the glycosylation motif of the different WNV isolates (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Glycosylation mutant WNV plasmids were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To assemble the infectious clones, the viral genomic cDNA was digested out from a bipartite-plasmid system, ligated, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and viral genomic RNA transfected into BHK cells as described previously[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The SYP and A’DEL (this mutant virus lacks the E αA’ helix (A’DEL; ΔE157-E160)) viruses were generated subsequently to assess the effect of mutating both the first and third amino acids in the glycosylation motif and to reduce the potential for genetic reversion at the glycosylation motif for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies and to assess the infectivity of a virus lacking the E154-156 motif, respectively. All viruses were harvested at 3 days post-transfection after observation of cytopathic effect (CPE). Full-length sequencing of the rescued viruses was performed to ensure the introduction of appropriate mutations and that extraneous mutations were not introduced. All viruses were titrated on Vero cells and plaque diameters measured (mm) from five representative plaques for comparison.
