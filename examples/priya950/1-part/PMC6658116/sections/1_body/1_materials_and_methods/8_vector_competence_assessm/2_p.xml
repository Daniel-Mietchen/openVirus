<p>Bodies were homogenized using a mixer mill at 24 cycles/sec for 2 minutes. Homogenates were clarified via centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 x g and assayed for the presence of virus by plaque titration on Vero cells. Infection rates were calculated as the number of virus-positive bodies as a percentage of the total number of mosquitoes assayed at 14 dpe. Dissemination rates were calculated as the number of virus-positive legs as a percentage of virus-positive bodies. Saliva samples from mosquitoes that exhibited virus positive legs were centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 5 min and titrated on Vero cells as described above. Transmission rates were calculated as the percentage virus-positive saliva as a percentage of virus-positive legs.
