<p>WNV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is transcribed and translated in one open reading frame[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There are three structural proteins, capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM), envelope (E), and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 that are translated and released after host and viral protease cleavage in the cytoplasm[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The prM-E proteins influence efficiency of virus infection, viral particle maturation and virus release[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The prM is cleaved from the E protein during virus replication and assembly, allowing the E proteins to dimerize and create a lattice-like structure around mature WNV virus particles during viral maturation and release[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The E protein facilitates cell attachment, allowing virus entry into the cell via the endosomal pathway[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Both the prM and E proteins contain N-linked glycosylation sites; however, only the prM N-linked glycosylation site is highly conserved among WNV isolates[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
