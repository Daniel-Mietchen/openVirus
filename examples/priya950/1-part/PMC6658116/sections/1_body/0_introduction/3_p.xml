<p>The WNV E protein N-linked glycosylation motif (asparagine-tyrosine-serine/threonine; N-Y-S/T) lies between amino acid (aa) positions 154–156 and exists in forms predicted to be glycosylated and not glycosylated with the site completely absent in some strains due to a four amino acid deletion across this motif[

 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The N-linked glycosylation motif is present in most WNV strains that have been isolated during significant outbreaks of human disease both in North America and globally (

 <sub>.</sub> WNV virus-like particles (VLPs) with mutations that prevent glycosylation at the envelope motif, in contrast, have been associated with reduced particle production in mosquito, mammalian and avian cells however, VLPs lacking envelope glycosylation exhibited higher infectivity rates in mosquito cells compared to VLPs with glycosylated E proteins[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In other studies, a non-glycosylated NYI mutant virus demonstrated reduced transmissibility following oral exposure of
