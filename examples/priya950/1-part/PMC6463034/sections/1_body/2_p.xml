<p>In summary, the response against ZIKV highlights the enormous potential of the scientific community to counter-attack against a viral threat. It is expected that this huge collaborative effort will produce the desired results and that we will have affordable and effective prophylactic and therapeutic tools against ZIKV in a reasonable period of time. Nevertheless, we would like it to be remembered that there are still arboviral threats other than ZIKV that should not be forgotten.</p>
