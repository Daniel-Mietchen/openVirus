<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes that jumped to fame in 2015 mainly due to its association with neonatal malformations (i.e., microcephaly) in Brazil [
 <xref rid="B1-jcm-08-00369" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although ZIKV is responsible for congenital Zika syndrome, most infections are asymptomatic or only cause mild illnesses characterized by rush, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise, or headache. In a reduced number of cases, ZIKV can also produce severe complications that include neurological disorders (Guillain–Barré syndrome) and ocular lesions [

 <xref rid="B3-jcm-08-00369" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The virus can also be sexually transmitted and can persist in the male genital tract, which could lead to infertility [

After its explosion in Brazil, the virus rapidly spread through Latin America, leading to the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2016. During the first stages of the epidemic, titanic efforts of the scientific community were conducted to rapidly understand ZIKV biology and pathology, improve diagnostic methodologies, and develop specific therapeutic and prophylactic alternatives. In fact, bibliometric analyses of the impact of ZIKV on scientific literature showed a huge increment in ZIKV-related scientific literature and patent application after 2015 [

 <xref rid="B7-jcm-08-00369" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-jcm-08-00369" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For the non-specialist, this can be easily and rapidly visualized by searching for Zika virus or ZIKV at PubMed, which is the most commonly used engine to access the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-08-00369-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). However, what seems to be more surprising is that when similar searches were performed for other medically relevant arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) namely, Dengue virus (DENV), Yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), it was observed that the document count for ZIKV over the last three years extensively surpassed them. Remarkably, this is even the case for DENV, which is currently considered the most life-threatening arbovirus, accounting for up to 100 million infections each year and a leading cause of serious illness and death among children [

This may be the product of a wide variety of factors, including the social alarm caused by babies with microcephaly, the rapid spread of the virus, the declaration of the PHEIC, the facilitation of ZIKV-research by funding agencies, or the interest of researchers to walk into an unexplored field. What it is clear is that the interest of the research community on ZIKV grew to unexpected levels after the 2015 epidemic. This can be again easily exemplified by the comparison of the research results for ZIKV after the Brazilian outbreak in 2015 with other recent viral outbreaks such as that of WNV in 1999 in North America [
