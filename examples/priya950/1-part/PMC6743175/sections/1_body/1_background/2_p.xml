<p id="Par12">HRVs are a major trigger of AECOPD and asthma exacerbations and may pose a significant problem for disease management [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. HRV is the most common virus found in AECOPD with some studies reporting up to 69% among all the viral isolates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Among the respiratory viruses, HRV infection preceded as many as 50% of asthma exacerbations in children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Over 100 types of HRVs have been characterized and classified into 3 groups: HRV-A, HRV-B, and more recently HRV-C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. With advances in technology, it is now possible to identify different groups of HRV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no data on the types of HRV that may precipitate AECOPD. There are very limited data on the subtypes of HRV that is related to adults with asthma exacerbations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore it is unknown that if certain viral infections would be associated with worse clinical outcomes of the patients, such as prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS) and readmissions.
