 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and asthma. Other contributing factors for exacerbations include air pollution [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. low temperature, and interruption of regular treatment. Studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported variable detection rates of microorganisms between 22 and 60% in patients with AECOPD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For asthma exacerbation, a previous study from the United Kingdom found that upper respiratory viral infections were associated with 80–85% of asthma exacerbations in children aged 9–11 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are limited data on viral aetiologies for asthma exacerbation in adults. A recent study in Australia found that viral, bacterial and mixed aetiologies were identified in 32, 5 and 7% respectively of asthma exacerbations with hospital admissions [
