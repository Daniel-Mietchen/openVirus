 <sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio &lt; 70%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] presented with at least two of the following major symptoms (increased dyspnoea, increased sputum purulence, increased sputum volume) or one major and one minor symptom (nasal discharge/congestion, wheeze, sore throat, cough) for at least two consecutive days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patients with asthma exacerbations were subjects aged ≥18 years, who had background asthma (with a consistent history, prior documented evidence of variable airflow obstruction and evidence of an increase in FEV
 <sub>1</sub> greater than 12% and 200 mL following bronchodilator or bronchial hyperresponsiveness on bronchial provocation testing, when stable) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], presented with either increasing dyspnea, wheeze or cough for at least 2 consecutive days.
