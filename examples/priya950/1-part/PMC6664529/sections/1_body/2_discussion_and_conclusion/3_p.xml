<p id="Par17">OP has been linked to multiple influenza viral infections including influenza A and B, but this is the first report of avian influenza H7N9-associated OP with relapse occurrence and severe respiratory failure. The main clinical features of our avian influenza H7N9-associated OP is similar to the cases of influenza A cases. In these cases reported, OP onset mostly at the second to third week in the course of influenza, and occurred after the releasing of primary virus infection; And the OP is complicated with respiratory failure, and no evidence of other pathogen was found; And the main findings on HRCT for this kind of OP were GGO and consolidation. Biopsy were done via TBLB or OLB at the third week. In cases with influenza associated OP, other than common findings of OP, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), alveolar hemorrhage and edema and bronchiolitis can also be found, showing the lung injury of primary virus infection. However, in our case, the patient present with high fever as a main manifestation of OP, and had a relapse of respiratory failure associated with OP. A differential diagnosis of OP should be considered at the second to third week after the primary infection among patients with influenza H7N9 infection. Furthermore, there was no clear evidence of bacterial and fungus infection during the beginning of hospitalization. However, the levels of PCT and galactomannan showed significant increase after the patient was established with ECMO. The OP may also be caused by the nosocomial infection which was frequently complicated with severe influenza pneumonia.</p>
