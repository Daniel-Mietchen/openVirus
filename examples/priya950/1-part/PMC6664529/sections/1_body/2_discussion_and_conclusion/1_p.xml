<p id="Par15">Since the cases infected with avian influenza H7N9 virus were first confirmed in 2013 in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], five seasonal epidemics were observed, with an earlier start and a steep increase in infected number in the latest epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In a clinical study including 111 cases confirmed H7N9 virus infection, 76.6% were admitted to an ICU and 27% died. The median time from the exposure to disease onset was five days, then, 6.8 days to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In dead cases, the median time from disease onset to death was 14 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Half of the patients required mechanical ventilation and 21% need ECMO for severe respiratory failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, refractory severe respiratory failure caused by OP secondary to avian influenza H7N9 virus infection was first reported in this case.
