<p id="Par18">The majority of patients with OP show rapid responding to steroids. The introduced initial dose is prednisone 0.5–1.0 mg/kg, with tapering over 6–12 month. However, up to one-third patients may relapse in tapering period. For the current patient with avian influenza H7N9-associated OP, methylprednisolone 80 mg (1 mg/kg) daily was applied for 5 days with tapering in the beginning of suspicion of OP. The patient showed rapid clinical and radiological improvement and was extubated on the fifth day of steroids applying. However, the patient deteriorated with high fever and refractory hypoxemia 10 days later. With the confirmation of histological examination, steroid dose was increased to methylprednisolone 120 mg (1.5 mg/kg) daily for 5 days. And OP was finally controlled without relapsing in follow-ups. Insufficient initial dose of steroid may contributed to the relapsing of OP before final diagnosis. Therefore, Post avian influenza H7N9 infection OP may responsive to a brief course (weeks) of moderate-to-high dose prednisone therapy.</p>
