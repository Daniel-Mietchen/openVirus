<p id="Par10">A 35 year-old male, non-smoker, with a history of poultry contact 10 days before, was admitted to emergency room with fever and cough for 4 days (considered as day 1 for the case timeline). Physical examination showed bilateral moist crackles. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell count (WBC) was 5.75 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L (and it became to 1.35 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L two days later), C reactive protein (CRP) was 13.3 mg/L, and procalcitonin (PCT) was&lt;0.1 ng/ml. Chest x-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Moxifloxacin 400 mg daily was administered for two days. And his condition deteriorated with dyspnea and severe respiratory failure, and the blood gas analysis showed PaO
 <sub>2</sub> was 58 mmHg under oxygen mask with a FiO2 of 0.8. He was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) supported with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and intubated 3 h later. Mechanical ventilation with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 32 cm H
 <sub>2</sub>O, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20 cm H
 <sub>2</sub>O and FiO
 <sub>2</sub> of 1.0 could not maintain the oxygenation. As his PaO
 <sub>2</sub>/FiO
 <sub>2</sub> ratio less than 50 mmHg lasted for 3 h, the venovenous-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was established. The microscopic examination, culture and galactomannan detection from serum and bronchial-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) for virus PCR, fungal, and the culture for bacteria and the microscopic examination for bacteria and tuberculosis were done at ICU admission. The nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza H7N9 virus of sputum specimen turned out to be positive and oseltamivir phosphate was initiated (150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks after the PCR of the virus were negative for two consecutive tests.). As the PCT rose to 4.84 ng/ml, and the galactomannan detection was positive (2.52 from serum sample and 1.21 from BALF sample), vancomycin, imipenem cilastatin and caspofungin were applied. Hydrocortisone 300 mg daily for 3 days was also used for septic shock.
