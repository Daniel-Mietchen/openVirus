<p id="Par12">However, the clinical condition of the patient deteriorated again on day 31 with high fever to 40 °C, refractory hypoxemia (PaO
 <sub>2</sub>:FiO
 <sub>2</sub> = 65) and a mild leukopenia (WBC was 11.92 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L). the patient was reintubated and supported with invasive mechanical ventilation. Methylprednisolone 80 mg daily was applied at the beginning as a suspicion of the relapse of OP. And chest CT on day 33 revealed progression of consolidation especially in the lower lobe. As the patient’s respiratory failure and condition did not improve after 5 days of daily use of methylprednisolone 80 mg, histological examination was done via open lung biopsy (OLB) on day 35, and OP was confirmed with the presence of intraluminal plugs of granulation tissue within alveolar ducts and surrounding alveoli associated with chronic inflammation of the surrounding lung parenchyma. The therapy of steroid was changed to methylprednisolone 120 mg (1.5 mg/kg) for 5 days, 80 mg for 7 days, 40 mg for 7 days. The oxygenation improved, and the patient was extubated on day 57 and discharged on day 71. A time line of the steroids use, white cell count and ratio of PaO
