<p id="Par11">ECMO was weaning off on day 15 (the time of ECMO supporting was 13 days) when his blood flow of ECMO was decreased to less than 2 L/min with a significant improvement on his chest X-ray. The patient turned to high fever in the following days. Repeated PCR for H7N9 virus were tested and show continuous negative in the lower respiratory samples after a week of ICU admission. Advanced antibiotics and antifungal agents were administered, no positive pathogenic result was emerged, and PCT level remained downtrend. The chest CT on day 17 shows bilateral GGO with aggravating consolidation on new areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), compatible with organizing pneumonia (OP). Considering no underlying cause of OP existed other than virus infection, therefore, OP associated with H7N9 influenza virus infection was suspected. Methylprednisolone 80 mg (1 mg/kg) daily was applied on day 17 for 5 days with tapering. With clinical improvement, the patient was extubated on day 21, and supported with NIV with a FiO
 <sub>2</sub> of 0.6. The chest CT on day 26 showed obvious remission of consolidation with patchy GGO and fibrotic changes.
