<p>18h post-transduction, 293T or A549 cells were infected with the indicated IAVs at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell and incubated at 37°C. At 8h or 12 h post-IAV infection, cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Following permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-M2 monoclonal antibody (E10; catalog no. EMS009, Kerafast). Three washes were performed prior to addition of goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-647 secondary antibody (catalog no. A21241, Life Technologies) and incubation for 2 h at room temperature. Antibody dilutions and washes were performed with PBS plus 1% Tween-20. Cells were treated with DAPI, and coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield (Vector Labs) mounting medium. Images were obtained with on a Nikon FV1000 confocal microscope at the Emory Integrated Cellular Imaging core facility.</p>
