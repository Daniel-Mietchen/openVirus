<p>Growth of each virus in the guinea pig model was assessed in three independent experiments with four guinea pigs per experiment. For transmission analysis, each guinea pig was treated as an independent biological sample. Statistical significance in the magnitude of replication was determined by comparing AUC of growth curves using two-tailed Student’s t-test. Statistical significance in transmission efficiency was determined using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test.</p>
