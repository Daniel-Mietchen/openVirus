<p>Non-synonymous nucleotide changes differentiating NL09 and avian consensus M segments were introduced in a reciprocal fashion into i) M1 and M2 to generate 16 mut viruses, ii) M1-only to generate 9 mut viruses, and iii) M2-only to generate 7 mut viruses. The modified viral cDNAs were synthesized by Genewiz and subcloned into the pDZ reverse genetic vector [
