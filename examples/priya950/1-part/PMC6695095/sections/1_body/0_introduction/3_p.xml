<p>Additional evidence for a role of the M segment in host range comes from the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> identification of positive selection acting on the M segment of the Eurasian avian-like swine lineage, following transfer of this IAV from birds to swine [

Moreover, others and we have shown that the M segment of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) strain carries determinants of transmissibility, suggesting that adaptation of this segment to humans contributed to the emergence of the pH1N1 lineage [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The mechanistic basis for this contribution; the specific roles, if any, of M1 and M2 proteins to host range; and whether the M segment plays a broader role in IAV host adaptation, remain unclear.
