<p>In the avian cell line, the PR8 NL09 M virus expressed lower levels of M2 than M1 (

When M1 and M2 levels were normalized to those of vinculin and the relative levels of M1 and M2 calculated, the NL09 M2 protein comprised &lt;10% of the total M segment-derived protein expression. Very similar results were seen for four PR8-based viruses carrying avian M segments grown in DF-1 cells. In each case, M2 comprised &lt;20% of the total M segment-derived protein, and in the case of three avian M segment-containing viruses (PR8 dkAlb76 M; PR8 dkAlb76 M 89G; and PR8 rheaNC93 M), the levels of M1 and M2 proteins were not significantly different from those expressed by the PR8 NL09 M virus (
