<p>The efficiency of transmission was assessed by calculating the proportion of contact animals that contracted infection, considering only cages in which donor guinea pigs were productively infected through intranasal inoculation. While transmission occurred in 7/9 instances for PR8 NL09 M virus, a significantly lower proportion of animals (1/20; p&lt;0.0001) were infected with a virus carrying an avian M segment transmitted from her cage mate (
