<p>To evaluate the impact of M segment host adaptation on viral phenotypes in an intact host, we evaluated the PR8 NL09 M virus and the four PR8-based viruses carrying avian M segments in a guinea pig model [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A low inoculation dose of 10 PFU per animal was used to maximize the sensitivity of the system. Each inoculated animal was co-caged with a na√Øve guinea pig at 24 h post-inoculation and viral infectivity, magnitude and kinetics of growth, and transmission were monitored by collecting nasal lavage samples every other day. Among those animals that were productively infected, total virus sampled in nasal washes over the course of infection was evaluated by calculating the area under the shedding curves shown in

 </bold>. Area under the curve values did not differ significantly among the four viruses with avian M segments, but were significantly higher for PR8 NL09 M virus (

 </bold>, fewer guinea pigs were productively infected with 10 PFU when the inoculating virus carried an avian M segment. Differences in the kinetics of viral growth were determined by assessing changes in growth over time using repeated measures ANOVA (
