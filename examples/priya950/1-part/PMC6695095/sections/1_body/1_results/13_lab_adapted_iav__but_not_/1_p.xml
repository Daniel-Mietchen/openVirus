<p>The M2-induced block in autophagic flux reported previously was based on multiple IAVs that were originally isolated from human hosts but passaged extensively in laboratory substrates [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To assess whether these prior data were consistent with our own, we compared M2 expression levels exhibited by one of the lab-adapted strains used, PR8. Our results show that the relative expression levels of M1 and M2 in PR8-infected 293T cells are comparable to those seen in cells infected with avian M-encoding viruses (
