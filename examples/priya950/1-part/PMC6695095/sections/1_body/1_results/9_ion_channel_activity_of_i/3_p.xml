<p>To ensure that the amantadine was working to prevent LC3B II accumulation through inhibition of M2 ion channel activity, we assessed the impact of amantadine treatment on the inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion by chloroquine. Amantadine had no impact on LC3B II accumulation in the absence of M2 protein (
