<p>To confirm that M2 protein was co-localizing with LC3-positive autophagic vesicles in mammalian cells, we monitored sub-cellular localization of an overexpressed LC3B-GFP fusion protein in infected cells. Human 293T cells were primarily used for this purpose as they transduce well with GFP-LC3. Under normal conditions, LC3B-GFP can be seen throughout the cell with a diffuse distribution (

 </bold>). Treatment with chloroquine, an inhibitor of autophagy that decreases autophagosome-lysosome fusion, results in the concentration of LC3B-GFP into punctate cytoplasmic structures (

 </bold>). In addition to these cytoplasmic puncta, viruses with avian M segments were found to redirect a small proportion of LC3B-GFP to the plasma membrane. Notably, the M2 protein co-localized with LC3B-GFP in PR8 avian M-infected cells, both in cytoplasmic puncta and at the plasma membrane. Similar phenotypes were observed in virus-infected A549 cells, at 8 hpi

 </bold>). Overall, these results suggest that expression of avian M2 protein at high levels interferes with the turnover of autophagosomes and with the localization of LC3B-GFP. In addition, the results reveal a reduction in the tight perinuclear localization of M2 upon LC3B overexpression.
