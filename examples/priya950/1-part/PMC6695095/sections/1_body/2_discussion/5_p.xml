<p>While the previously reported block in autophagy induced by IAV has generally been interpreted as a viral defense against an antiviral mechanism, a pro-viral role for autophagy is not without precedent. In Dengue virus infection, autophagy has been reported to support viral replication. Specifically, autophagic turnover of lipid droplets in infected cells is thought to provide energy needed for viral growth and to supply phospholipids important during virion assembly [

This relocalization occurred to a lesser extent in a well-matched IAV-host system (NL09 M in human cells), and may play a functionally important role in this context. A role for LC3B II in morphogenesis is consistent with the activation of autophagy having a pro-viral effect. Conversely, our data indicate that a block in autophagic turnover reduces viral growth, potentially owing to disruption of vesicular trafficking that is normally exploited by the virus [
