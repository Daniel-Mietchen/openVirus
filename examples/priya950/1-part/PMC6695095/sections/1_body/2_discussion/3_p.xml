<p>The gene segments of IAVs circulating in humans are ultimately derived from the avian IAV gene pool. Thus, the contrasting phenotypes conferred by avian- and human-adapted M segments in mammalian cells suggest that a resetting of M segment gene expression to reduce M2 levels has been positively selected following emergence of avian IAVs into mammalian populations. Indeed, our data reveal that this adaptation has occurred in at least two independent incidences: i) within the Eurasian avian-like swine lineage M, that emerged from birds in the late 1970s and contributed the M segment to the pH1N1 virus prior to 2009; and ii) within the human seasonal lineage derived from the 1918 pandemic, which contributed its M segment to the H3N2 lineage represented by Pan99 virus. The timing of the adaptive changes is unclear in each case and cannot be inferred from our data. Importantly, M2 expression in human IAV mimics that of avian IAV in avian cells. Thus, restriction of splicing efficiency to achieve low M2 levels appears to be an important feature of IAV host adaptation. Our data furthermore suggest that the negative impact of an autophagy block on viral growth constitutes an important pressure driving this selection.</p>
