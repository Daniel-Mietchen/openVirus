  <title>Ratio of mRNA
   <sub>7</sub> (encoding M1) to mRNA
   <sub>10</sub> (encoding M2) expression is high in DF-1 cells irrespective of viral M Segment host origin.
  </title>
  <p>DF-1 cells were inoculated at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell with PR8 viruses encoding avian or human-derived M segments and incubated at 37Â°C for 8 h prior to RNA extraction. RT primer extension radiogram of virus-infected DF-1 cells: 
   <bold>(A)</bold> 5S rRNA levels were measured to allow normalization of viral RNA. Segment 7 vRNA expression was measured to assess viral replication. Levels of mRNA
   <sub>7</sub>, mRNA
   <sub>10</sub>, and mRNA
   <sub>11</sub> mRNA expression were assessed using radiolabeled probes. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> mRNA
   <sub>7</sub>, 
   <bold>(C)</bold> mRNA
   <sub>10</sub>, and 
   <bold>(D)</bold> mRNA
   <sub>11</sub> was quantitated and displayed as a percentage of total M gene-expressed mRNA. Graphs in 
   <bold>B-D</bold> show the means with SD from three independent experiments. For each experiment, two replicate radiograms were quantitated. Statistical significance was assessed using ordinary one-way ANOVA.
