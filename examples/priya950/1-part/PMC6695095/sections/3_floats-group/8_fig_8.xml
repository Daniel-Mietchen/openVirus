  <title>In human cells, avian M2 was expressed at higher levels and localized more strongly to perinuclear bodies than human M2.</title>
  <p>A549 and 293T cells were inoculated with the indicated viruses, encoding avian or human M segments, at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell. At 8 hpi cells were stained with anti-M2 (Mab E10; red) and DAPI (blue) and imaged by confocal microscopy. Examples of optical sections are shown, either as merged 2-color images or the red and blue channels alone (shown in grey scale). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> A549 cells with 63x optical and 3x digital magnification (189x total magnification). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> 293T cells with 63x optical and 3x digital magnification (189x total magnification). Brightness was adjusted for optimal clarity, with all images treated equally.
