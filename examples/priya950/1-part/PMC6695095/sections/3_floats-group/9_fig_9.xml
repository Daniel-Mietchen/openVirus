  <title>Visualization of LC3 and M2 co-localization.</title>
  <p>293T cells were transduced with GFP-LC3 protein and inoculated 24 h later with the indicated IAVs, encoding avian or human-derived M segments, at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell. Cells were fixed 8 h later and stained with anti-M2 (Mab E10; red) and DAPI (blue) followed by imaging with confocal microscopy. CQ: chloroquine. Examples of optical sections are shown, either as merged 3-color images, or the red, green, and blue channels alone (in grey scale). Images are at 63x optical and 3x digital magnification (189x total magnification). Brightness was adjusted for optimal clarity, with all images treated equally.</p>
