  <title>Inhibition of proton channel activity relieves M2-induced accumulation of LC3B positive vesicles.</title>
  <p>293T cells transduced with LC3-GFP were inoculated at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell with PR8 viruses possessing M segments from a human or an avian strain and incubated in the presence or absence of 200 Î¼M amantadine from 1 hpi. Cells were fixed at 12 hpi and stained with anti-M2 (Mab E10; red) and DAPI (blue) followed by imaging with confocal microscopy. Examples of optical sections are shown, either as merged 3-color images or the red, green, and blue channels alone (in grey scale). 3x zoom of a 63x magnification is shown. Brightness was adjusted for optimal clarity, with all images treated equally. CQ: chloroquine.</p>
