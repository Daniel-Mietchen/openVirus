  <title>Schematic depicting chimeric M Segment RNAs.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> Pandemic H1N1 influenza virus M1 and M2 proteins differ from the avian consensus sequences by 9 residues in M1 and 7 residues in M2. The pH1N1 amino acid identities are indicated in blue at their approximate positions within linear representations of M1 and M2 proteins. The pH1N1 M segment differs from the avian consensus by 8.3% at the nucleotide level. Here, pH1N1 RNA sequence is indicated by blue coloring. 
   <bold>(B-D)</bold> Chimeric human-avian M segments were constructed in which only the non-synonymous changes in the avian consensus were introduced into the A/NL/602/09 (H1N1) M segment. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Avian consensus M1 and M2 proteins differ from the NL09 sequences by 9 residues in M1 and 7 residues in M2. The avian amino acid identities are indicated in red and avian RNA sequence is indicated by red coloring. 
   <bold>(F-H)</bold> A second set of chimeric M segments was constructed in which the NL09 amino acid identities were introduced into the M segment of A/duck/Alberta/76 (H1N1) virus, yielding segments that encode avian consensus protein(s) but retain much of the nucleotide sequence of the NL09 M segment.
