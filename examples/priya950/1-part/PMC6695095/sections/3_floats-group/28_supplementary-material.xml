  <title>Levels of mRNA
   <sub>7</sub> (encoding M1) and mRNA
   <sub>10</sub> (encoding M2) transcripts in A549 cells infected with viruses carrying human, avian or chimeric M segments.
  </title>
  <p>A549 cells were inoculated at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell with PR8 NL09 M virus and PR8 Av M virus, along with six PR8-based viruses with chimeric M segments. Cells were incubated at 37Â°C for 8 h and then lysed with a RNeasy Kit. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> RT primer extension radiogram of virus-infected A549 cells. 5S rRNA levels were measured to allow normalization of viral RNA. Segment 7 vRNA expression was measured to assess viral replication. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Levels of mRNA
   <sub>7</sub>, 
   <bold>(C)</bold> mRNA
   <sub>10</sub>, and 
   <bold>(D)</bold> mRNA
   <sub>11</sub> were quantitated and displayed as a percentage of total M gene expressed mRNA. Graphs in 
   <bold>B-D</bold> show the means with SD from three independent experiments. For each experiment, two replicate radiograms were quantitated. Statistical significance was assessed using ordinary one-way ANOVA.
