 <sup>®</sup> SIL significantly decreased the viral loads during the treatment; however, in all three studies, viremia rebounded after the end of treatment and became insignificant between the two groups, and no patient reached SVR after 24 weeks of follow up. These results confirmed the anti-HCV effect of Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL, but eradication of the virus may require longer administration or combination with other antivirals.
