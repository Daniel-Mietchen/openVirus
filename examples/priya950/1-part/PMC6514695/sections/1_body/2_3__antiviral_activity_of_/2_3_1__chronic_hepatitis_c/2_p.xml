<p>Consistent with the above results, intravenous infusion of Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL appeared to produce a better anti-HCV effect in clinical studies. Ferenci et al. demonstrated in a before-after study that 14 consecutive days of Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL infusion combined with 7 days of Peg-IFN+RBV treatment dose-dependently and continuously decreased HCV viral load in chronic hepatitis C patients who were previously non-responders to the Peg-IFN+RBV therapy [

After the infusion schedule, antiviral treatment with Peg-IFN+RBV and oral silymarin continued, and HCV RNA became undetectable in several patients of the 15 or 20 mg/kg/day groups. A later study analyzed the pattern in viral load decline over time with intravenous Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL monotherapy, and suggested that Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL may block both viral infection and viral production or release, with its dose-dependent effect mainly associated with blocking HCV production/release [

 <sup>®</sup> SIL (20 mg/kg/day), and Peg-IFN with a modified administration protocol [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The two groups also demonstrated in the next three years that additional Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL infusion, 20 mg/kg/day for 14 or 21 days [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], or 1400 mg/day for 2 days [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], could induce undetectable viral load in over half of the on-treatment non-responders to Peg-IFN+RBV therapy. Later in 2015, Dahari et al. published a case report showing that a patient who had severe adverse effect from IFN-containing regimen achieved SVR (sustained virological response) after 33 weeks of Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL infusion plus RBV and vitamin D therapy [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These results highlighted the potential of using Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL in combination with either IFN-based or IFN-free treatments to treat patients who are non-responsive or intolerable to IFN-containing treatments.
