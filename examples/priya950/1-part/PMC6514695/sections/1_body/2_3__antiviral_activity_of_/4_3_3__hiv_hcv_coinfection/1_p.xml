<p>Sharing similar transmission routes, 25â€“30% of HIV patients are coinfected with HCV [

Traditionally, HIV/HCV coinfected patients are known to be more difficult to treat compared to their mono-infected counterparts using Peg-IFN+RBV combination therapy. However, the use of the recently introduced DAAs in these patients has been demonstrated to yield similar SVR rates to those only infected with HCV [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Despite this miraculous achievement, the DAAs are very expensive and have the tendency to select for resistant mutants. Thus, finding alternative treatment strategies for the treatment of these patients is highly desirable. Due to the ability of silymarin and derivatives to target both viruses, several clinical trials have explored the use of these drugs in the HIV/HCV coinfected patients.
