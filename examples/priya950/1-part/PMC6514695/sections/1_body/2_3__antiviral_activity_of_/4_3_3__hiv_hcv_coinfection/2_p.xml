<p>Payer et al. explored the use of Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL infusion in a 27-year-old female with the unfavorable single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) IL28β genotype T/T, who was coinfected with HIV and HCV and refractory to Peg-IFN+RBV treatment [

 <sup>®</sup> SIL (20 mg/kg/day) monotherapy for 14 days. At day 8, the combination therapy with Peg-IFN+RBV was then started and continued until week 16 when the treatment had to be stopped due to psychiatric and other adverse events. Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL monotherapy for 1 week substantially decreased both HCV and HIV RNA levels, and after 2 weeks of Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL therapy including 1 week of Peg-IFN+RBV combination therapy, both HCV RNA and HIV RNA were undetectable. While the HIV RNA rebounded back 24 weeks after cessation of treatment, the HCV RNA remained negative during the same time frame [
