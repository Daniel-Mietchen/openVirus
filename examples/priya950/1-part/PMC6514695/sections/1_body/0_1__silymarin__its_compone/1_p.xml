<p>Silymarin, an extract from the seed of the milk thistle plant (
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> [
 <italic>S. marianum</italic>]) is widely known for its hepatoprotective functions, mainly due to its anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects [

Although silymarin is known mostly for its hepatoprotective functions, accumulating evidence now suggests that the extract possesses potent antiviral activities against numerous viruses, particularly hepatitis C virus (HCV). Consequently, silymarin is the most commonly consumed herbal product among HCV-infected patients in western countries [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite its potent medicinal effects, silymarin suffers from poor solubility which affects its bioavailability in vivo. To improve the issue, the chemically-hydrophilized silibinin, Legalon

To date, silymarin and its derivatives have been examined for potential bioactivities against several viruses and various strategies to address its drug delivery challenges have also been explored. This review examines the current literature concerning the antiviral effects of silymarin and silymarin-derived compounds used in preclinical and clinical studies, the challenges to clinical application, as well as its prospects as clinically applicable antiviral agents.
