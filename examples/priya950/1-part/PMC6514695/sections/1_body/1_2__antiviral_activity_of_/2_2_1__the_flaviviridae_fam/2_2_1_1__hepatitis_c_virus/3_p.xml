<p>In contrast, Blaising et al. in 2013 showed that the major bioactive component silibinin exerts antiviral effect against HCV by blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis [

More recently, we developed silibinin nanoparticles (SB-NPs) and showed that both the SB-NPs and the conventional silibinin inhibited HCV infection by blocking viral cell-to-cell spread [
