<p>Following the above discovery, the same authors in two independent studies demonstrated that silymarin treatment blocked different steps of the HCV (JFH-1) life cycle, including entry/fusion, replication, and virion production in the host cells [

Interestingly, both studies observed an impact of silymarin on HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, albeit at concentrations higher than that required for its anti-HCV effect. Consistent with the inhibition of the RdRp activity, Belkacem et al. employing silybin A, silybin B, and Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL demonstrated that all three forms of silymarin components inhibited HCV replication by targeting the HCV RdRp activity of NS5B, with an IC50 value ranging between 75–100 μM [
