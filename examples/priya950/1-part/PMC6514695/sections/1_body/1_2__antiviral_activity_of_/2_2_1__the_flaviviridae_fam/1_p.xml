<p>Flaviviruses are (+)ssRNA viruses that include important human pathogens such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dengue virus (DENV). HCV is known to cause chronic infection (hepatitis C) that can lead to end-stage liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [

Although the treatments for HCV infection has remarkably improved with the advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), important issues such as cost, selection of drug-resistant mutants, and challenges in the difficult-to-treat populations have limited the widespread use of these drugs. DENV infection on the other hand, has no available antiviral treatments. These circumstances necessitate the search for novel/alternative forms of therapy to complement the existing treatment options.
