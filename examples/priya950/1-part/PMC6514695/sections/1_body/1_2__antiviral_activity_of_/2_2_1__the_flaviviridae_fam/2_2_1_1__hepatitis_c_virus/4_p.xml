<p>In 2016, DebRoy et al. investigated the antiviral effect of intravenous Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL monotherapy on uPA-SCID chimeric mice with humanized livers [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mice chronically infected with HCV were treated with different intravenous doses of Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL (469, 265 or 61.5 mg/kg) for 14 days before analyzing serum HCV, human albumin, and liver HCV RNA levels. The results demonstrated that Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL monotherapy led to a biphasic serum viral decline without affecting the human albumin levels, suggesting that the antiviral effect observed was not due to a decline in the human hepatocytes. Furthermore, administration of Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL induced anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative gene expressions that were demonstrated by a decrease in TNF-α and NFκB-associated transcriptional activations. Interestingly, the microarray analysis showed that Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL treatment inhibited the expression of genes such as interleukin 8 (IL-8), nicotamidine N-methyltransferase (NNMT), and osteopontin/secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), which are known to facilitate HCV replication, consistent with the inhibition of HCV production. These results suggest that Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL could efficiently inhibit HCV production in mice in the absence of adaptive immunity in vivo.
