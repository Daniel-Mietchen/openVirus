<p>Together, the results discussed above support the robust anti-HCV activity of silymarin and its derivatives, although the underlying anti-HCV mechanism varies substantially from study to study. Possible explanations include discrepancy in the source or type of drug used (e.g., silymarin component, purity, and extraction method), variation in experimental design such as concentration and treatment protocol, and the specific model systems employed. This is supported by Wagoner et al.’s work demonstrating that the oral and intravenous (i.e., Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL) formulations of silibinin exert different effects on HCV life cycle, inflammation, and antiviral signaling in vitro [

Nonetheless, given that silymarin and its constituents are bioactive against several cell physiological processes, it is likely that silymarin and its major active components may exhibit impact on multiple steps of the virus life cycle, either directly or indirectly.
