<p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. HIV is estimated to currently infect over 38 million people, the majority of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. The advent of the highly active antiretroviral therapy has monumentally improved the survival rate of the HIV-infected population by substantially decreasing the viral load while at the same time preserving the CD4 count. Despite this advancement, the treatment is life-long and associated with side effects. Currently, there is no effective vaccine against this deadly human pathogen. Therefore, identifying novel therapeutics to complement the existing ones would be expected to further improve the management of HIV-infected patients. Interestingly, about 30% of the HIV-infected patients in Europe and North America are co-infected with HCV [

 <sup>®</sup> SIL [

 <sup>®</sup> SIL inhibited HIV replication in the HeLa cell line TZM-bl, PBMCs, and the human T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CME in vitro. Mechanistic studies revealed that Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL blocked HIV replication by attenuating cellular functions implicated in T-cell activation and proliferation, hence resulting in fewer CD4+ T cells expressing the HIV co-receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5. In a separate study, the authors further characterized the role of Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL in HIV infection and demonstrated that Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL treatment at the time of virus adsorption in PBMCs and CEM cells blocked HIV infection [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Intriguingly, the authors showed that in contrast to their previous report, silibinin’s perturbation of T-cell metabolism is not involved in its ability to block HIV entry. Thus, it appears that silibinin could simultaneously block HIV entry and T-cell activation. Combined together, these results provide evidence for the robust anti-HIV role of silibinin, which therefore merits further evaluation for potential development as an anti-HIV agent.
