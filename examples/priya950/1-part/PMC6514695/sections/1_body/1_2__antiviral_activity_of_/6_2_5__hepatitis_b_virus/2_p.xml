<p>In 2008, using a different approach, Wu et al. tested the effect of the silymarin on HBV X protein (HBx) transgenic mice and demonstrated that the natural product possesses therapeutic effects at the early stages of HCC development when given orally to 4â€“6 weeks old transgenic mice [

Specifically, oral administration of silymarin dose-dependently reversed fatty liver changes and restored normal liver histopathology in these animals. Further analysis revealed that administration of silymarin to the precancerous HBx transgenic mice prevented the development of HCC. In contrast, silymarin treatment could not block the progression of established cancer in mice and had no significant effect on the HBx gene expression. The fact that silymarin did not modulate HBx gene expression could imply that the drug does not affect HBV replication, which is consistent with the in vitro study above. Thus, it appears that silymarin blocks HBV infectivity by influencing early viral entry.
