<p>Viral infections represent important public health concern and socioeconomic burden globally. Presently, numerous viral infectious diseases are without effective vaccines and/or specific antiviral treatments. The increased significance of viruses as human pathogens, and the rising epidemic outbreaks worldwide due to increased population density and migration/travel, underscore the need to continuously identify antiviral strategies against these infectious agents. Silymarin and its derivatives have been reported to possess potent antiviral activities against a number of viruses by targeting multiple steps of the viral life cycle. We describe below the antiviral activities of silymarin and its derivatives against different important human viruses in preclinical studies. Results of the in vitro or in silico studies as well as the in vivo studies are summarized in
