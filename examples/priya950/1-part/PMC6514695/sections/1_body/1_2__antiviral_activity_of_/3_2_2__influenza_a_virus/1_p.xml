<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is a highly contagious virus and a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Influenza epidemics and pandemics pose a serious threat to both human and animal populations. Although effective vaccines are available against IAV, these vaccines must be regularly updated due to the ability of the virus to induce frequent antigenic drift and occasional antigenic shifts to its envelope glycoproteins. Moreover, only few IAV antiviral therapeutics have been clinically approved and currently in use including neuraminidase inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, continuous identification of novel therapeutic strategies to expand or complement the existing options against this important pathogen is highly envisaged. Gazák et al. developed silibinin derivatives that were conjugated with long-chain fatty acids and demonstrated their superior anti-influenza virus activity compared to conventional silibinin in plaque reduction assay [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The authors demonstrated that silymarin dose-dependently inhibited IAV replication without significant cytotoxicity. Further examination revealed that the silymarin-mediated inhibition of influenza replication occurred through inhibition of late mRNA synthesis. However, whether or not silymarin could modulate other phases of the influenza life cycle was not investigated. The other study that looked at the anti-influenza activity of silymarin was the study by Dai et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Due to the importance of autophagy in promoting influenza replication, these authors elegantly designed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (BiFC-FRET) assay to analyze the anti-influenza activity of 89 medicinal plants and discovered that 
 <italic>S. marianum L</italic>. possessed excellent activity in the assay. In order to improve the anti-influenza activity, the authors synthesized five silybin amino acid derivatives (S0–S5) and demonstrated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) antiviral assay that S3 is the most effective against IAV. Further analysis with plaque inhibition assays revealed that in addition to inhibiting the autophagy elongation complex formation, the S0 and S3 derivatives robustly inhibited IAV replication as well as several physiological processes induced by influenza replication, such as oxidative stress and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and I kappa B (IκB) kinase (IKK) pathways. In agreement with the report above, the authors demonstrated through a time-course analysis that S0 and S3 mainly inhibited IAV replication without exerting any significant effect on viral adsorption. Therefore, it appears that silymarin and its derivatives’ antiviral activity against IAV is chiefly mediated by the inhibition of viral replication. Finally, in vivo oral administration of S0 and S3 not only increased the survival rate in mice infected with a lethal dose of IAV, but also decreased the viral titers in their lungs [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01552" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These results, together, point to a prominent role of silymarin as a potent IAV inhibitor.
