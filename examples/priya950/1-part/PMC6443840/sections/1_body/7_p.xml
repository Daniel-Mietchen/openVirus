<p>As ecological change drives the spread of vector species into new geographical regions and incidence increases, arboviral pathogens are a growing threat to public health. Research that characterizes host-pathogen interactions and mechanisms of pathogenesis is critically important to understanding the underlying biology and developing effective medical countermeasures. In conclusion, we want to thank all authors and reviewers for their valuable contributions and insight to this research topic. This topic is timely and we hope that it inspires increased research efforts and insight into arbovirus biology and pathogenicity to ultimately alleviate the burden of arboviral infections.</p>
