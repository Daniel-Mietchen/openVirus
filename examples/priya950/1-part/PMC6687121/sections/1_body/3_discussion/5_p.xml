<p>We also found that high efficacy vector control measures can significantly decrease the number of cases, which is consistent with previous studies[

 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, the intervention measures may be limited by the control resources. It is suggested that effective vector control measures should be implemented if there were adequate control resources. Otherwise, the vector control measures should be implemented at an earlier time. Similar to some studies[
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the number of cases would substantially decrease if vector control measures were started in a timely manner after the onset of the endemic epidemics. In our model, the number of cases would be reduced by more than 90%, even if the vector control measures were implemented one month after the onset of the first endemic case. As mentioned above, the delay of the diagnosis of the early cases is an important risk factor for controlling the spread of the epidemic in time. Therefore, the premise of implementing timely vector control is diagnosing and reporting cases at an early stage. It would be necessary to have a screening of the nonstructural1 (NS1) antigen in all suspected cases in all medical institutions among the season of the epidemic.
