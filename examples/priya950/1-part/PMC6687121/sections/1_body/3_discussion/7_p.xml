<p>According to our study, isolation of the symptomatic case is not a good way to control the development of dengue epidemics due to the large number of inapparent infections. The effectiveness may be better when the I:S ratio is kept at a low level. It should be noted that the case management would use more resources and time. Furthermore, this measurement is actually difficult to implement when there is no enforcement rule to restrict the behavior of the case. Therefore, the actual effectiveness of isolation would be greatly reduced compared to the theoretical value.</p>
