<p>Furthermore, we found that continuous vector control intervention was necessary, which is consistent with previous research in this field[
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The effect of implementing vector control measures every few days was not satisfactory compared to that of eradicating the mosquitoes every day. Our study also demonstrated that implementing vector control measures every day for 30 days could obtain similar effectiveness of performing the same work until the end of the epidemic. However, it should be noted that this time will be more than 30 days if the reduction in the mosquito density is less than 5%.
