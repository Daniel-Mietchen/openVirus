<p>The outbreaks that occurred in Hangzhou were divided into two periods with the cut-off set as August 29. The period before August 29 was regarded as without intervention measures, and the integrated measures were implemented after the date. First, we simulated the epidemic without any control measures based on the data of the first stage and obtained the unknown parameters. Then, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was calculated to check the accuracy of the model by comparing the reported number of cases with the estimated incidence among the first period. Third, we simulated a model without any control measures to estimate the total possible cases and the inapparent incidence, and the inapparent-to-symptomatic (I:S) ratio was computed at the same time. Fourth, we estimated the effectiveness of vector control with different levels of daily reduction in mosquito density and at different initial times. Due to the limited control resources, the epidemic with implementing control measures between an interval period was also simulated. Finally, the effectiveness of case isolation was evaluated at different initial times.</p>
