<p>In the following three sections of the paper, the effectiveness of vector control with different patterns will be estimated. It is indicated that the reduction in the mosquito density could decrease the number of human infections and shorten the period of the epidemic (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220391.g003">Fig 3A</xref> suggests that the higher the daily reduction in mosquito density, the lower the epidemic magnitude is. To illustrate, 1400 indigenous dengue cases were found at 5% daily reduction in mosquito density and 980 cases at 7.5%, and when daily reduction in mosquito density increased to 10%, the number of cases dropped to 773 by the end of November 2. The durations of these three epidemics were 114, 97 and 86 days, respectively. The peak of the epidemic also shifted to an earlier date on September 7, September 2, and August 31.
