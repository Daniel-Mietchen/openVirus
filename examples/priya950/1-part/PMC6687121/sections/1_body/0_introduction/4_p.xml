<p>However, research has not considered incorporating dengue with inapparent infections in a transmission model, which might greatly influence dengue transmission in outbreaks [

According to research, dengue infections with no detectable symptoms or before the onset of symptoms are significantly more infectious to mosquitoes than people with symptomatic infections. The inapparent cases could contribute to the persistent circulation of dengue virus and may play an important role in driving epidemics such as cholera[
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the role of inapparent infections in dengue epidemics. The objective of this study was threefold. First, this study evaluated the effectiveness of vector control and case isolation. Second, it simulated epidemic development based on different levels of control measures, taking inapparent infections into consideration. Lastly, it estimated the proportion of inapparent infections.
