<p>Both cellular and viral FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (cFLIP and vFLIP, respectively) protect cells from death receptor mediated apoptosis. Kα2 is a vFLIP-derived peptide that consists of 10 amino acids from the α2 helix of the Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) death effector domain 1 protein. A synthetic version of this peptide, TAT-Kα2, was generated by fusing Kα2 to a portion of the HIV TAT protein (

In mouse challenge studies, intranasal administration of TAT-Kα2 at the time of infection with highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus resulted in protection of the treated mice. No replicating virus was detected in the lungs at either 3 or 5 days after infection suggesting complete protection from infection (

It should be noted that this effect is largely due to direct destabilization of the virions by the TAT-Kα2 peptide and it is likely that infection in treated mice was not established; the efficacy of this AMP has not been determined during an established infection and warrants further investigation.
