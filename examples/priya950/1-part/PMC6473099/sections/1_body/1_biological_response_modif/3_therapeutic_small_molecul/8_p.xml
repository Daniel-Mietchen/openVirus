<p>Protease activated receptor (PARs) link protease activity to inflammatory cellular responses (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). PAR1 expression is upregulated in the mouse airways following IAV infections (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Intranasal administration of a PAR1 antagonist (SCH79797) at the time of infection with various IAV strains including highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and pandemic H1N1 viruses led to increased survival and a decrease in inflammatory responses. Moreover, this effect was also observed when SCH79797 was administered 48â€“72 h after infection (
