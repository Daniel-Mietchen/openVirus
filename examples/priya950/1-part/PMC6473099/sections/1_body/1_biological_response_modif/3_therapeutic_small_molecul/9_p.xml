<p>The use of statins, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) has been proposed to regulate the IAV-induced cytokine storm in severe infections (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Retrospective studies conducted separately in Mexico, Netherlands, UK and USA reported an association of reduced IAV-related pneumonia and lower case fatality due to lower respiratory tract IAV infections with statin treatment (

 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). However, this association was contested in two additional studies that found no benefit of statin treatment on IAV-induced disease burden (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). This uncertainty regarding the IAV therapeutic potential of these widely used compounds warrants further investigations at the basic science level and in clinical trials.
