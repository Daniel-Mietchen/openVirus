<p>The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38, regulates viral entry and replication (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Furthermore, p38 regulates IFN stimulated gene (ISG) gene expression and ultimately cytokine production via STAT1 phosphorylation (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Using either of two specific p38 inhibitors (SB 202190 or SB 203580), mice were protected from lethal H5N1 infection exhibiting reduced mortality and pro-inflammatory responses (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Importantly, treatment of mice with the clinically approved MEK inhibitor (CI-1040) showed reduced lung viral load and mortality of mice following infection with a lethal dose of pandemic H1N1 IAV; interestingly, this inhibitor significantly out-performed the clinically recommended oseltamivir in these studies (
