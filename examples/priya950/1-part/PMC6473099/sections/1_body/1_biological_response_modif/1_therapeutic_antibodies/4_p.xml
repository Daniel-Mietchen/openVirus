<p>Neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar space occurs within 1 day following IAV infections (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The complement protein C5a was shown to induce NETs release and administration of anti-C5a Abs (IFX-1) reduced H7N9-induced ALI due to reduced infiltration of lung macrophages and neutrophils as well as reduction of viral load in African green monkeys (
