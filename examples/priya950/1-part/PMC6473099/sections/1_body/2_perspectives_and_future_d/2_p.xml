<p>A large effort has been made in recent years to identify host proteins to serve as intervention targets against IV infections. Several genetic and proteomic screens have identified several promising hits with potential roles in the IV replication cycle (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>–
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). In addition to these genome-wide screens, viral and host protein interactions can be mapped into networks that can also be used to identify host factors critical for IV replication (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). Interestingly, meta-analysis of some these studies shows limited overlap in the genes/proteins identified as required host factors (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>–
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). This is likely due to study-specific variations in IV types/strains and cell-lines used, inclusion/exclusion criteria, limited hit-validations and methods used to “knock-down/out” these genes.
