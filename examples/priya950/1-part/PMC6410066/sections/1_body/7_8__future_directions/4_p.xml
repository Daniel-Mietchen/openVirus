<p>Our understanding of the mechanisms of immune memory for antigenically variable and dynamic pathogens such as influenza viruses is limited. The human studies from Andrews and colleagues have given evidence that the precursor to plasmablasts initiated by vaccination is the memory B cell [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This leaves several questions regarding the mechanisms of memory B cell development as well as activation and initiation of plasmablast function. Not all memory B cells are the same. Some are resident within the primary infected tissue while others circulate in the periphery [

 <xref rid="B128-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>,
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Furthermore, memory B cells may be germinal center dependent or independent. It would be insightful to determine if antigenic relatedness across sequential virus infections influences memory B cell pathways, development, and recall. Moreover, what are the signaling pathways leading to memory B cell transformation into plasmablasts? Is activation dependent on the antigenic variation in the viral exposure sequence? Researching these questions may uncover molecular key drivers of this immune refinement process. Identification of key drivers of immune refinement for dynamic pathogens may suggest targets for improved vaccine development.
