<p>The adaptive cellular and humoral responses move through 3 phases: expansion, contraction, and at last memory. Expansion is the time period when antigen specific T and B cells proliferate to produce a large number of reactive cells to control the pathogen. Experimental studies from our group as well as others investigating immune responses in animal models (non-human primate and ferret) have shown that lymphocytes as well as virus specific antibodies circulate at high numbers (in the expansion phase) even after pathogen clearance (21 and 48 days, respectively) [

Eventually, adaptive immune cells begin to contract (contraction phase) until there is a limited number of highly specific cells able to circulate for immune surveillance. This memory pool of pathogen specific cells establishes long-term protection for secondary encounters [
