<p>Much of this review will concentrate on the humoral immune response during influenza virus infection in the preimmune host. With this in mind, we profile the role of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the host-pathogen interaction for comparison in the sequential infection studies that we discuss below. CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to the clearance of virally infected cells by several different actions much of which is regulated by respiratory DC produced cytokines. As mentioned above, DCs (CD103
 <sup>+</sup> DCs) that detect virus within the lungs, migrate to the lymph node transporting with them the acquired influenza virus antigen. In the lymph node, naïve CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells interact with CD103
 <sup>+</sup> DCs which leads to T cell activation, proliferation, and survival [

 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The effector CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells migrate to the lung where they contribute to the immune response by releasing proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, MIP-1α to activate additional immune responses. In the lung, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells also directly kill infected cells by releasing perforin and granzyme or by activating proapoptotic TNF receptors in the surface of the target cell. These activities are directed by the cell type: epithelial cells (CD45
 <sup>−</sup>) or DCs (CD45
 <sup>+</sup> CD11c(hi)) [

 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses promoting viral clearance [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Once in the lung, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells acquire the ability to produce the regulatory cytokine IL-10 inhibiting continual CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and the activity of Th17 cells [

 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Moreover, considering the role of CD8+ T cells during secondary infection, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells have greater potential for cross-reactivity between antigenically divergent influenza virus strains since these cells can target internal conserved viral proteins [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Although T cell cross-reactivity cannot inhibit viral infection, the presence of previously activated CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell specific clones can increase the recovery time of influenza virus secondary infections.
