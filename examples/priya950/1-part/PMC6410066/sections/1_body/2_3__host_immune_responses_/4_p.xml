<p>The primary humoral response to infection is defined by the generation of short-lived plasma cells (antibody producing cells) that reside in secondary lymphoid organs [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Activated B cells mature into plasmablasts and plasma cells producing antibodies targeted at viral epitopes. During primary influenza virus infection, a large and diverse pool of antibodies are produced and circulated [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Animal modeling of influenza virus infection in na√Øve hosts has shown that most elicited antibodies are HA head-specific [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Smaller percentages of elicited antibodies target the HA stalk, NA, M2, or internal proteins of the virus [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Importantly, antibodies directed toward the conserved HA stalk can be broadly reactive and block membrane fusion (discussed above) [

 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. These have been shown to be important for host protection by neutralizing the virus, inhibiting viral fusion, and promoting viral clearance [
