<p>Using mice, ferrets, and guinea pig models, monosubtypic heterologous (MsHe) infection-reinfection studies have revealed that an infection with the sH1N1 viruses (circulating 1977 to 2009) leads to partial protection upon reinfection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 “lineage” (2009 H1N1) [

 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Reduction in disease severity in the sequential sH1N1-&gt;2009 H1N1 infections was shown in these studies by minimal weight loss, decreased lung viral load, and decreased lung pathology in mice and ferrets [

Fang reported that primary infection induced preexisting non-HA antibodies which were elicited during 2009 H1N1 virus challenge due to sequence homology of the less immunogenic internal viral proteins. Focusing on the HA protein, other reports showed that MsHe sequential infections of the same permutation (sH1N1-&gt;2009 H1N1) led to the generation of both HA head and stalk directed antibodies [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Another report synthesizing human and ferret data also investigated sH1N1-&gt;2009 H1N1 infection sequences but focused on the specific sH1N1 epitopes that may invoke a stalk-specific response during re-exposure [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. This report showed that people imprinted with a historical H1N1 virus containing HA K133 amino acid (a.a.) mounted a dominant antibody response directed toward the HA receptor binding region in the head during secondary exposure [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The sH1N1 strains with a K133 a.a. signature circulated from 1983 to 1996. K133 a.a. is also present in many 2009 H1N1 viruses representing a point of cross-reactivity. Conversely, people imprinted with sH1N1 viruses outside of this time period (before 1983 or after 1996) had a response dominated by antibodies directed toward the HA stalk during 2009 H1N1 infection [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. These findings were confirmed with ferret experimental data recapitulating the human immune backgrounds and analyzing antibody specificity. Together the data from MsHe sequential infection studies suggested that if the reinfection strain has antigenically-divergent epitopes in the HA head, the memory B cells that were previously generated to the stalk will be preferentially recalled over establishing new head specific antibodies.
