<p>Influenza virus is not a single virus but, instead, a family of constantly changing virus strains. The family is defined by four virus types that are then divided into subtypes or lineages. Influenza viruses are the archetype of emerging and re-emerging viruses. Influenza virus type A and type B currently circulate in humans causing seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to the propensity for mutation, distinct strains emerge each year with the ability to infect the vulnerable human population [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Yearly, influenza viruses infect between 5% and 15% of the population with higher incidences (~30%) in children [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This suggests that every person will be infected or exposed to the influenza virus by the time they are four years old. Furthermore, considering prominent government-supported influenza vaccination programs, the age of first influenza virus exposure is most likely lower. Since influenza viruses cycle yearly in the human population and the immunity gained from previous infection is not life-long [
