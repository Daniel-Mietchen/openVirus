<p>Below we review the literature surrounding influenza virus immune imprinting and preimmunity. We first outline the development of preimmunity by discussing influenza virology, influenza history, and primary immune responses. This sets the stage for integrating modern investigations of imprinting and preimmunity. We conclude by highlighting the mechanistic knowledge gaps. Advancing the field of host preimmunity will contribute to the next generation of influenza vaccines.</p>
