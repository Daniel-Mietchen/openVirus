  <p>Timeline of the history of influenza virus circulation in humans since 1890s. The timeline shows the history of influenza virus type A and B circulation since 1890. There have been 6 presumptive pandemics in this time period. The Russian pandemic of ~1891 occurred prior to the discovery of the influenza virus and is known only by historical medical records. Seroarcheology has suggested that this outbreak was caused by an H3N8 virus. In 1918 what was known as the Spanish Influenza Pandemic took place. The H1N1 virus which had caused the pandemic was not definitively identified until lung samples from victims of the pandemic were sequenced in 2005. It is estimated that 50 to 100 million deaths were caused by this virus. H1N1 viruses circulated until 1957 when H1N1 was replaced with an H2N2 pandemic virus during the Asian pandemic. The H2N2 virus was replaced with H3N2 during the 1968 Hong Kong pandemic. In 1977, H1N1 resurfaced and since then, H1N1 and H3N2 have co-circulated. In 2009, the emergence of an H1N1 strain of swine origin replaced the former seasonal H1N1 virus ‘lineage’ which was in circulation from the 1977 lineage. In addition to circulating seasonal influenza viruses, avian virus spillover events also lead to human infection. Major avian virus spillover events occurred in 1997 and 2013 for the influenza A viruses H5N1 and H7N9, respectively. During this time period, influenza B viruses have also co-circulated in humans. *Image credit CDC for the 1918 pandemic and the influenza virion [
