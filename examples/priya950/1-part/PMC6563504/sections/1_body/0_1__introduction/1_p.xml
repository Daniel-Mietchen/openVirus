<p>Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease, annually infecting 5–15% of the human population and causing epidemics that result in 3–5 million severe cases with 300,000–500,000 deaths each year [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The annual recurrence of epidemics is caused by the continuous alteration of seasonal influenza viruses, which enables them to efficiently escape the immune system even due to previous infections or vaccinations [

The major burden of disease in humans is caused by seasonal influenza A (IAV) and influenza B viruses, causing symptoms varying from mild respiratory disease characterized by fever, sore throat, headache and muscle pain to severe and in some cases lethal pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections [
