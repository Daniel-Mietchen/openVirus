<p>Several ordinary differential equations (ODEs) models have been developed to provide insight into within-host dynamics of influenza A virus infections (for reviews, see [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). These models work in a time scale of days and describe the concentration dynamics of target cells, immune system components, viral load, and sometimes co-infecting pathogens. The models differ in terms of complexity and state space dimensions, which are between 3 and 15 for the models examined here. While the low-dimensional models can be analyzed completely and in a straightforward way (e.g., by calculating their fixed points and stability analysis), the characterization of the entire behavioral spectrum of complex models is more difficult (see for example [
