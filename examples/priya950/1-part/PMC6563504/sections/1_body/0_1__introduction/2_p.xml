<p>The long-term spread of influenza viruses in the human population and the acute nature of influenza virus epidemics is driven by the global movement of these viruses. Differences in seasonal epidemics caused by influenza viruses are mainly driven by differences in the rates of virus evolution. The single-stranded RNA segments of influenza viruses, which are located inside the virus particle (or virion), evolve rapidly and thus can escape the hostâ€™s immune response very efficiently.</p>
