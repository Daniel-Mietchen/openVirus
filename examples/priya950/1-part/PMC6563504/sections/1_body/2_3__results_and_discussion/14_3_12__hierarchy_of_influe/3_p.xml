 </inline-formula>). There are models that furthermore have infection (

   <mrow>
    <mi mathvariant="bold" mathcolor="#01DF01">X</mi>
   </mrow>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>) in their organizations. There are exactly two models (Hancioglu and Hernandez Model) with immune response in all their organizations which means that these models implicitly assume immune response to be active all the time. Among the models neglecting immune response are those which have infection (Miao Model) or bacteria (

   <mrow>
    <mi mathvariant="bold" mathcolor="#FE9A2E">X</mi>
   </mrow>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>) (Smith Model) in their organizations and also those that do not (Baccam and Baccam II Model). For models involving immune response, the situation is more complex. There are those that only have healthy cells in their organizations (Pawelek and Saenz Models). This means that these models implicitly exclude infection and immune response from the long run and thus treat them as transient phenomena a priori. The Bocharov Model is the only one that exhibits only healthy cells and immune response in its organizations but no infection. The remaining five models include all kinds of species (except for bacteria of course) in their organizations.
