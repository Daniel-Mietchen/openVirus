<p>The derived hierarchical map of models might be used to choose the most appropriate model for a particular domain and data set: The model should contain at least one organization for each set of species that were experimentally observed to survive in the long run. If there are several models with such organizations, the one with the smallest organizations might be chosen to provide maximum efficiency in modeling.
