<p>In the literature, there exist several mathematical models of IAV dynamics that are derived from experimental data, reviewed in Refs. [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). These models differ in their complexity, e.g., the number of reactions and the number of species, depending on the available experimental data used for parameter fitting and questions to be answered. For example, models can include eclipse phases, an innate immune response, or an adaptive immune response.
