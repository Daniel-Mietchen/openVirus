<p>After having exemplified our method in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-viruses-11-00449">Section 2</xref> by an analysis of the basic target cell limited model by Baccam et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we present now the full analysis for eleven additional more detailed influenza models of IAV dynamics, with up to 15 variables (species) and 45 reactions (cf. 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00449-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for an overview at the end). Note that for our analysis we abstract from kinetic details, that is, the organizations are independent of particular settings of parameter values.
