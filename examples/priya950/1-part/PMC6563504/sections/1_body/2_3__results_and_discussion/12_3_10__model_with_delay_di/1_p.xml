<p>The Bocharov Model [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] contains 49 parameters and was designed to fit experimental in vivo data from humans [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It includes 10 variables and 51 reactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00449-f0A9">Figure A9</xref>). Only here and in the Lee Model (below) we have differential equations with 
 <italic>delay</italic>, i.e., some rates depend on variable values from the past (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00449-f013">Figure 13</xref>a). Because the delay does not matter in a steady-state, we can also neglect the delay when analyzing the chemical organizations of a delay differential equation model.
