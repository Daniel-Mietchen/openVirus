<p>The Cao Model [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] consists of 20 parameters and has been derived by referring to experimental data from ferrets. The model has seven variables and 26 reactions. Like in most of the previous models, we have (uninfected) target cells (
 <italic>T</italic>), infected cells (
 <italic>I</italic>), viruses (
 <italic>V</italic>), resistant cells (
 <italic>R</italic>), and interferon (
