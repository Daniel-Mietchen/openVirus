<p>For simplicity, the modelsâ€™ variable names also denote the related

 <italic>V</italic> denominates not only the number of viruses in the ODE model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00449-f002">Figure 2</xref>a), but also the virus itself (e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00449-f002">Figure 2</xref>b).
