<p>In a first step, we need to obtain the reaction network underlying the ODE model. A reaction represents, for example, a cell infection by a virus, the generation of new viruses from an infected cell or the spontaneous death of a cell. The reaction rules can be derived from the ODEs in a straightforward way [
