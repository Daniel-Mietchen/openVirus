<p>Throughout this paper, the following coloring scheme for particular classes of species is used to improve readability:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <styled-content style="color: #0000FF">Uninfected (target) cells or those resistant/refractory to infection are marked in blue, e.g., 
     <italic>T</italic>
    </styled-content>.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <styled-content style="color: #FE2E9A">Infected cells, partially or latently infected cells, and viruses are marked in magenta, e.g., 
     <italic>I</italic> and 
     <italic>V</italic>
    </styled-content>.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <styled-content style="color: #01DF01">Species belonging to the active immune response are marked in green</styled-content>. It is worth noting that the first two models analyzed in this paper [
    <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
    <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] do not explicitly have immune system components.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <styled-content style="color: #FE9A2E">Bacterial co-infection species are marked in orange</styled-content>. These species are only occurring in Smithâ€™s model [
    <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00449" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Text referring to any other species is marked in black, e.g., transient target cell states, passive immune system, or dead cells.</p>
  </list-item>
