  <p>Hasse-diagram of the hierarchy of IAV models with respect to their long-term behaviour. In brackets (), we added the number of species of each model. Underneath (marked by colors) the kinds of species contained in the organizations belonging to each model. The meaning of the four colors is as follows: Species belonging to the healthy state of the organism are colored

   <styled-content style="color: #FE9A2E">orange</styled-content>. Horizontally, the diagram consists of four lines. The models in the lowest line contain organizations with exactly two different kinds of species (colors) (including the empty set). In the second line above, there are three different combinations of species (colors) to be found in each model. There is only one model in each of the highest two lines: The Smith model [
