  <p>Distribution of the final infected fraction in different timing and coverage of vaccination strategies. A synthetic population of ten thousand individuals was generated. One thousand simulations were run to simulate the epidemic in the time course of one year. Each time, one individual was chosen randomly as the index case. Circles, diamonds, and connected lines are median. Filled areas are the corresponding non-parametric densities estimates [
