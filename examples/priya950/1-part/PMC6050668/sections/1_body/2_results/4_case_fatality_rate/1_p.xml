<p>Simulations showed that the case-fatality rate in the absence of intervention was about 91% (Additional fileÂ

Furthermore, simulation results showed that all the intervention strategies mentioned previously reduced the case-fatality rate. These results highlighted a benefit of vaccination programs even if they were late: reducing the disease severity in newly infected subjects after the introduction of the vaccination program. As such, relying on R0 as the solely indicator for evaluating intervention programs would overlook this life-saving aspect.
