<p>Theoretical analyses of stochastic epidemic models showed that when R0 is larger than unity, the final size of an epidemic converges to a bimodal distribution: either the epidemic dies out with a small number of infected cases or the epidemic takes off to a normal distribution with a high number of cases [

 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Without intervention, EBOV had approximately 50% probability to infect more than half the population. The introduction of vaccination programs at the two previously mentioned coverages and at any vaccination time points under assessment scaled down the epidemic size (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The earlier the vaccination programs were deployed, the closer the epidemics size distribution resemble to a uni-modal distribution centered at a low infected fraction. The high vaccine coverage strategy effectively eliminated the possibility of having a major outbreak infecting a large proportion of the population. This was achieved when the vaccination programs were deployed at any time point from one week to five months before time zero.
