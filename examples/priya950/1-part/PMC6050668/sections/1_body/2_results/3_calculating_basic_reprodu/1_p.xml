<p>After each simulation, the uninfected nodes were removed from the initial network. Then the basic reproduction number was calculated as the average network degree, considering the network as a directed and without loop network (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>-Left). Simulation results showed that the overall estimate of R0 was 1.43 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>-Right). However, the estimates differed across age-groups with the highest of 4.7 for the group of 10-14 years of age. Intuitively, the age-groups with a higher contact rate had also a higher R0. Simulations of epidemics with varied intervention strategies showed that Re can be reduced below unity if a vaccination program with 85% coverage was deployed at the time as far as five months before the introduction of the index case (time zero) or as late as one week after that (Additional file
