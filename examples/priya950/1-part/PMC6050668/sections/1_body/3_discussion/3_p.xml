<p>To determine infection outcomes, the threshold AUC
 <sub>7</sub> was chosen based on suggestions derived from empirical data in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and non-human primates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Simulations of the epidemics using this threshold reproduced estimate of EBOV case-fatality rate (Additional fileÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2), suggesting that the use of total viral load (AUC) as a criterion for determining infection outcomes is appropriate. It is worth noting that the calculated case fatality rate was based on the assumption of worst case scenarios where no treatments were provided. In practice there were medical approaches to reduce disease severity. Scientific literature has shown that for severe cases of EBOV infection (equivalent to unvaccinated subjects or those vaccinated too late in our model), supportive treatments increased substantially the survival chance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Although a more precise threshold criterion is desirable, it might not be feasible to obtain it in practice considering the inherent ethical reasons. Thus a similar criterion as used here could be considered when adapting this approach to other diseases, but ideally derived from dedicated experimental data.
