<p>Estimates of the EBOV’s incubation period suggested a contact tracing period of three weeks for Ebola epidemics, matching the current WHO’s recommendation of 21 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Estimates of the delay distributions agreed with information that EBOV infected subjects can be infectious from day 3 up to three weeks post infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Understanding of these delay distributions is critical in clinical and epidemiological perspectives [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. These distributions, however, are often only partially observed in practice: it is difficult to know the exact time of exposure to the pathogen or to have complete outbreak data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. As such, parameter estimation of these distributions have been relied on testing and comparing distributional assumptions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The mechanistically generated transmission characteristics using virus dynamics remarkably resemble literature estimates. This suggests some inherent biological processes where individual dynamics accumulate to produce population-level epidemics. This approach is thus promising and practical given the accumulating experimental data on varieties of pathogens, such as a disease
