<p>Regarding EBOV epidemics, previous R0 estimates based on epidemic data varied strongly, depending on model choices and assumptions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Our estimate of R0 was 1.4 which is within the range of the previous estimates, ranging from 1.2 to 2.6, with some exceptional estimates up to 4.7 and 8.3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Notably, we showed that the estimates differed by age-groups with the highest of 4.7 for the group of 10–14-years of age. Although these estimates depend on Sierra Leon’s age-structure, the differences of R0 estimate stress the role of the age-structure and contact patterns in the estimation of R0, prompting that age-specific intervention strategies should be considered. The estimates by sub-groups also single out the effort required to control the epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. With the assumptions used in our models, targeting interventions to the group 5–20-years of age would be the most effective strategy. Note that the differences of R0 by age-group also provide us an explanation of the wide variation of the previous estimates of R0 where different samples were used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. As the R0 estimates were larger in sub-groups, our results confirmed that the critical vaccine coverage also needed to be larger to ensure eradication of the epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Using our approach, we have shown further that while a low coverage could not completely eradicate the epidemic, it could largely reduce both the size and severity of an epidemic—which is worth pursuing in cases of lacking resources to reach an optimal threshold.
