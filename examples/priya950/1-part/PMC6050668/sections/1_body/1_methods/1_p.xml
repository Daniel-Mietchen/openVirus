<p>In an EBOV-infected subject, the immune system components dynamically evolve in response to the virus replication dynamic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. As a result, a series of events is triggered determining the infection outcomes such as infectious status, symptoms, recovery, or death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In this paper, the EBOV replication dynamic within a host was used to infer its transmission parameters.
