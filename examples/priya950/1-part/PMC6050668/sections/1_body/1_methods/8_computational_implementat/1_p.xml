<p>The simulations were written in vectorized R language [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) were solved with deSolve package [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The network was generated as an adjacency matrix and was visualized with the package igraph [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Computations of infection dynamics of the newly infected nodes were done during the epidemic simulation after obtaining its infective dose and immunization status. For nodes with identical conditions, their infection courses were copied instead of recomputing the ODEs for speed (Availability of data and materials). Repeated runs of epidemic simulations to obtain uncertainty estimates were done on computer clusters of the Center for Scientific Computing (CSC) of the Goethe University Frankfurt. Distribution of computation resources was sent from within R to SLURM Workload Manager.
