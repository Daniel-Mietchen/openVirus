<p>Computational approaches in epidemic modelling date back a few centuries ago [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since then, an overwhelming amount of research has been conducted and contributed profoundly to understanding of epidemic control and prevention [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The aims of epidemic modelling are to address questions such as whether or not a substantial population fraction is getting infected? how large would the outbreak spread? or how can the outbreak be mitigated with intervention approaches at hand? among others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Answering these questions requires the quantification of these models using disease data on a population level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which are often delayed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], under-reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], or not readily available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As a result, epidemic models using population data, while progress understanding on diseases, might have limited applications to an ongoing epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A potentially useful way to predict future disease dynamics is using within-host processes [
