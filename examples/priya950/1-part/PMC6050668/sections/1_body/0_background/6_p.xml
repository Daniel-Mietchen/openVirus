<p>Improving understanding on EBOV transmission is crucial: EBOV can cause a large scale outbreak with a high fatality rate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and it re-emerges continuously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]; as of May 2018, a total of 32 EBOV disease cases have been reported from Democratic Republic of the Congo, including 18 deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Based on our previous studies of the within-host EBOV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], we brought forward a within-host infection model to study the transmission fitness of EBOV at the population level. We built a network model based on social contact data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and the respective epidemic simulation algorithm that embedded the within-host model into the contact network. Thus, this multiscale model was data-informed at each level of the epidemic process.
