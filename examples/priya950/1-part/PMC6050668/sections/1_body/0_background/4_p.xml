<p>The interplays between within-host infection and between hosts transmission led to arising attempts connecting the two levels [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], but the approach is still at its infancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. On one hand, most of these models were conceptual and theoretical [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or relied on assumptive and previously obtained parameter estimates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We propose that this limitation can be overcomed by using explicitly within-host infection model as a unit in epidemic simulations. This allows not only a high level of heterogeneity to be expressed, but also the study of stochasticity effects in epidemic spreading.
