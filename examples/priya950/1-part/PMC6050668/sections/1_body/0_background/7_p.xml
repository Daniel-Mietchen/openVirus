<p>Our multi-scale model aimed to express the link between pathogen load and transmission potential of an infected host, the immune responses to the infection and vaccination, and the heterogeneity of the contact frequency distribution in a population. The parameters obtained from model simulations were compared to those estimated from population-level data and empirical observations. The results showed that within-host infection model reproduced estimates of the transmission parameters and allowed detailed evaluations of the effects of intervention timing on the course of the epidemic. Implementations of the network model from social contact data was straightforward and scalable for large simulations on high-performance computer clusters. In that capacity, epidemic assessments and preparations can be conducted quickly, ahead of time, and with high-resolution requirements.</p>
