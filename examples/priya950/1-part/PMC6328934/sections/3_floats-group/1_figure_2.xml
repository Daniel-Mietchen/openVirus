   <bold>A</bold>) Mean number per year of N-linked glycosylation (NLG) sites on the head and HA2 stem regions of HA, and on NA, from human isolates of A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), and B-Yamagata and B-Victoria lineages. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Residues of HA and NA from human A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) isolates on which more than 10% of isolates contained NLG. HA and NA sequences from human A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) isolates were downloaded from GISAID on September 6, 2018, manually curated to remove duplicates and laboratory variants, and aligned using MAFFT. Sites of potential NLG were identified based on sequence. The residue indicated as ‘23a’ in A(H3N2) represents an insert relative to earlier HA isolates that was present in some viruses isolated in the 1970s. A(H1N1) viruses did not circulate among humans between 1957 and 1976, and those years are not shown. In 2009, indicated by red dashed lines, circulating seasonal A(H1N1) viruses were replaced by a novel pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 strain. Influenza B viruses split into B-Yamagata and B-Victoria lineages in around 1983 [
