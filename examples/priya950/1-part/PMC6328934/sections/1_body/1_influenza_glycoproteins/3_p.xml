<p>The surface glycoproteins of IAV, especially HA, are very tolerant of amino acid variations [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], allowing them to accumulate mutations that alter their antigenic nature. As IAV circulates in humans, HA and to a lesser extent NA [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] are therefore able to undergo repeated antigenic changes in response to population immunity. This ‘antigenic drift’ presents a public health challenge because of the need to adjust the composition of seasonal vaccine in most years to provide protection against newly circulating antigenic variants. In contrast with IAV, IBV do not have subtypes of HA and NA. Influenza B viruses were first identified in the 1940s, and in the 1980s evolved into two genetically and antigenically distinct lineages, the B/Victoria/2/87 and the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineages. Co-circulation of both influenza B virus lineages with influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses during seasonal epidemics has prompted the development of quadrivalent vaccines that include strains from both subtypes of IAV and both influenza B lineages.
