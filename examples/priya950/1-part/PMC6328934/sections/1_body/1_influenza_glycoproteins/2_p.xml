<p>IAV HA and NA are antigenically variable, with 18 structural variants of IAV HA and 11 variants of NA have been identified [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. IAV subtypes are named based on their HA and NA combinations. In the 20th and 21st centuries, most IAV-related diseases in humans have been caused by the A(H1N1), A(H2N2), and A(H3N2) subtypes. In 1918, the highly pathogenic pandemic A(H1N1) killed as many as 50â€“100 million people [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In 1957, A(H1N1) was replaced by A(H2N2), and in 1968 the A(H3N2) strain caused a global pandemic associated with more than one million deaths [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In 1977 the A(H1N1) virus re-emerged and co-circulated with A(H3N2) until 2009, when the swine-origin A(H1N1) pandemic (A(H1N1)pdm09) IAV replaced the older, antigenically distinct human seasonal A(H1N1) strain. Humans are also sporadically infected with highly and low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses, particularly H5, H9, and H7 HA subtypes. As yet, these viruses do not efficiently spread from person to person.
