<p>Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and contain a genome consisting of eight negative sense RNA segments. Segments four and six encode two major virus surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (HA), a trimeric lectin, and the neuraminidase (NA), a tetrameric enzyme (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The number of NAs on the viral surface is up to 10-fold less than HAs [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The external parts of both proteins consist of a stalk and globular head regions. HA is the virus’s primary receptor-binding protein, binding to specific receptors that possess terminal 
 <italic>N-</italic>acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or sialic acid [SA]), particularly on epithelial cells and mucins of human respiratory tracts (RT) [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. SA-independent binding and internalization of influenza virus HA also occur via specific cell-surface proteins on alveolar and recruited monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and B cells [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20–26</xref>]. Binding to cell receptors is the first step in the process leading to a productive virus infection. As with HA, NA also has specificity for terminal SA [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The primary role of influenza virus NA is to cleave SA residues from virus and cellular glycoproteins at the time of the budding of newly formed virions from the surface to prevent virus-self aggregation and enable its release from infected cells. As well, NA cleaves SA from the mucins of the RT to facilitate viral movement to target cells [
