<p>As well as modulating recognition of glycoproteins by the adaptive immune system, glycans on influenza viruses are also important for interactions with the innate immune response. Innate responses are the first line of host defense against viral infection. This system relies on recognition of pathogen-associated molecular properties (PAMPs) that distinguish pathogen molecules from those of the host. For example, terminal mannose residues are features of influenza virus HA and NA, but are not typical of human glycoproteins. When such PAMPs are detected, host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are activated, leading to downstream effects that limit pathogen replication, recruit more innate immune cells, and induce and amplify adaptive immune responses, as outlined in detail in a recent review [

Although many antiviral PRRs are intracellular, a number of cell-surface and soluble molecules act as antiviral PRRs, and some of these are lectins (proteins containing carbohydrate or fibrinogen recognition domains [CRD and FBG, respectively]) that generate an antiviral effect through binding to either mannose, fucose or galactose derivatives on influenza virus HA and NA [
