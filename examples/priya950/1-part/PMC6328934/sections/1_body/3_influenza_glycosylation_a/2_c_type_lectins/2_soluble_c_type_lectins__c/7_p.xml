<p>Collectins protect against influenza infection by several mechanisms. Direct binding to mannose residues on IAV HA [
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>,
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>] and NA [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] blocks virus–receptor interactions and entry and leads to aggregation of viral particles. As well, formation of collectin–virus complexes enhances phagocytosis and modulates inflammatory responses [

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123–127</xref>]. Collectins inhibit influenza virus NA activity not only through direct binding to glycoprotein, but also through steric hindrance of the NA active site by lectins bound to glycans on HA [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>].
