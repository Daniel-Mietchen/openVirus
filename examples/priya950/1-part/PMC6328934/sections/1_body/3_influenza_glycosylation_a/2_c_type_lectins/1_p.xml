<p>Lectins that require calcium for binding are called C-type lectins [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. These lectins can be present in serum and respiratory secretions as soluble molecules (collectins) or expressed on the surface of innate immune cells (endocytic lectins). The structure of a typical collectin includes an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, a collagen-like domain (CLD), a neck region, and a CRD responsible for ligand binding [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Collectins include surfactant protein D (SP-D) and mannose-binding lectin (MBL), both of which have anti-influenza activity. Endocytic lectins implicated in anti-influenza activity include macrophage mannose receptor (MMR), macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL), and DCs specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN).
