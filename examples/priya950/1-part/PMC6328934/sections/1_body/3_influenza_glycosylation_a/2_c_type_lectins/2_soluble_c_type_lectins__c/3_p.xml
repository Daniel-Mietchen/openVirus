<p>Both SP-D and MBL have been shown to protect against IAV infection in cell and animal models. SP-D has also shown the ability to neutralize IBV in tissue culture cells [
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. While the SP-D is recognized as a major component of the innate immune response to influenza, the role of MBL in protection against influenza is not as clear [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Different strains of influenza seem to have widely varying susceptibilities to SP-D and MBL, and at least part of this may be related to the number, location, and composition of glycans on HA. As noted above, reduced morbidity, mortality, and viral lung titers in mice and ferrets were observed with A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) IAV as the level of HA glycosylation increased [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96–100</xref>]. Viruses that have low levels of glycosylation, such as the pandemic 1918 A(H1N1), 1957 A(H2N2), 1968 A(H3N2), and 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 strains [

 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101–106</xref>] and the zoonotic A(H5N1) [
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107–109</xref>] and A(H7N9) [
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] strains, are relatively resistant to neutralization by SP-D and MBL in animal models, while highly glycosylated viruses are typically more susceptible [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111–113</xref>].
