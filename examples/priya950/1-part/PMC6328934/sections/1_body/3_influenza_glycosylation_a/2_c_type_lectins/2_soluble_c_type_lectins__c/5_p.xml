<p>In mice, MBL was present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by day 3 after infection with the mouse-adapted A(H1N1) strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. MBL-knockout mice showed increased susceptibility to infection with a PR8 reassortant expressing the NA and NP segments and the highly glycosylated HA from the A(H3N2) strain A/Philippines/82 [
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>], but infection of MBL-deficient mice with A(H1N1)pdm09 or avian A(H9N2) strains, which are less heavily glycosylated, resulted in reduced severity and inflammation than in wild-type mice [
