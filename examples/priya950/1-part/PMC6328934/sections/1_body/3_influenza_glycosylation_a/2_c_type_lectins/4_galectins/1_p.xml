<p>The galectins constitute a family of soluble, primarily mammalian, C-type lectins that are produced by various tissues, including airway epithelium and immune cells [
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. They are typically between 14 and 35 kDa and contain a conserved CRD of about 130 amino acids that exclusively bind β-galactosides (such as lactose [Galβ(1–4)Glc] and N-acetyllactosamine [Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc]) [
