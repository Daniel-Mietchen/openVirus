<p>Virus uptake through CLRs depends on the level of influenza virus HA (but not NA) glycosylation [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Increased HA glycosylation, and glycosylation at specific positions, resulted in a higher level of influenza infection in both macrophages [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and DCs [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Interaction between CLRs and glycans on HA may represent an important route for infection of macrophages and DCs immune cells with influenza viruses.
