<p>Several studies have confirmed calcium-dependent lectin-mediated interactions between influenza and macrophages [

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and DC [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Such interactions could lead to infection of macrophages and DC, activation of these cell types, or both. While there is no direct evidence that CLR interactions with influenza are important for macrophage and DC activation, binding to endocytic CLR enhanced IAV infection of these cells [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For example, MMR or MGL on macrophages was shown to be principal co-receptors (along with SA-containing receptors) for A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) virus entry and infection [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. DC-SIGN serves as an endocytic receptor for entry and infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 [
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>] and A(H3N2) IAV [
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], and enhanced expression of DC-SIGN in activated B cells increases their susceptibility to HPAI A(H5N1) infection [
