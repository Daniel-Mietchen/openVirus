<p>Glycosylation on specific residues of HA is associated with increased susceptibility to SP-D for some A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) IAV strains. The presence of an NLG site at residue 181 [

For example, A(H3N2) from the 1968 pandemic, which has lower levels of glycosylation, and current seasonal strains both contain an NLG site at residue 181. However, the 1968 strain is relatively resistant to both SP-D and MBL, while contemporary strains are sensitive [
