<p>Among the three influenza types, IAV is the greatest public health concern because of its ability to cause not only widespread seasonal epidemics, but also pandemics originating from zoonotic infections [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9–13</xref>]. IBV has not yet been associated with pandemics but causes seasonal epidemics and is responsible for ∼25% of human seasonal influenza infections [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Together, seasonal epidemics of IAV and IBV can cause up to 5 million infections and 500,000 deaths annually [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Type C virus typically causes a mild respiratory illness [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and in contrast with IAV and IBV, it is not included in the composition of seasonal influenza vaccines. As it is of less public health concern, ICV has been less studied than IAV and IBV. Therefore, this review will focus on IAV and IBV only.
