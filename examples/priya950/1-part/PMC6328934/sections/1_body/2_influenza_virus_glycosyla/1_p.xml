<p>As well as simple amino acid changes, antigenic drift often involves changes in influenza virus HA and NA glycosylation patterns that shield or expose particular antigenic sites on these glycoproteins [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Host–cell dependent glycosylation is a critical post-translational modification of influenza virus HA and NA. Glycosylation in the HA stalk region is important for protein folding and trafficking and for pH stability [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36–38</xref>], while the extent of glycosylation near the HA receptor-binding site alters its affinity for SA-containing receptors [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39–41</xref>]. Glycosylation near the cleavage HA site also modulates virus pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. While the role of glycosylation of NA is less well understood, N-linked glycosylation is important for functional NA [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and lack of NA glycosylation increases neurovirulence of the A/WSN/33 IAV strain in mice [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
