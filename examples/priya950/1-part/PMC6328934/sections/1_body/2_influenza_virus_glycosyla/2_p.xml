<p>Glycosylation of HA and NA occurs through attachment of an oligosaccharide molecule to the side-chain amide nitrogen of Asn in the context of the conserved N-linked glycosylation (NLG) sequon Asn-X-Ser/Th, where X may represent any amino acid except Pro [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This attachment occurs with the help of glycosyltransferases and oligosaccharyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is followed by a complex process of trimming and remodeling of the oligosaccharides by glycosidases and mannosidases during transit through the ER and Golgi. This process results in a glycoprotein whose N-linked oligosaccharides branched structures terminate in mannose (high-mannose glycans), galactose and/or N-acetyl-galactosamine/fucose (complex glycans), or a combination (hybrid glycans) [

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Some influenza virus HA and NA NLG sites may contain predominantly high-mannose glycans as the result of steric hindrance preventing access to the glycosyltransferases [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In contrast with cellular proteins, the complex oligosaccharides on influenza virus HA and NA are typically not sialylated, since NA removes the terminal SA [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. To date, NLG is the only type of glycosylation observed for influenza virus HA and NA: there has been no O-linked (i.e. attachment of a sugar molecule to the hydroxyl group of Ser or Thr on the polypeptide chain) or C-linked (i.e. attachment of a sugar to a carbon group on a Trp side-chain) glycosylation reported for influenza virus.
