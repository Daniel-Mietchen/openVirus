<p>The 1918 pandemic A(H1N1) IAV HA had six NLG sites (at residues 27, 28, 40, 304, 498, and 557) within the stalk region and only one (at residue 104) on the globular head of HA (

As with A(H3N2), the NLG sites on the HA stalk region of A(H1N1) IAV have been highly conserved, and subsequent glycan losses and gains have occurred within the globular head only. Like A(H3N2), A(H1N1) IAV showed a trend toward increasing glycan number on the globular head until its elimination in 1957 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), but after re-emerging in 1977 the number of glycans remained roughly constant until the virus was replaced by the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic virus (indicated with red dashed lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This strain had evolved within swine for many decades and was antigenically and genetically more similar to very early human A(H1N1) strains than to the human seasonal A(H1N1) strains that it replaced. The number of NLG sites on human IBV HA has remained fairly constant at 10â€“12 sites since the split of Yamagata and Victoria lineages (
