<p>Different influenza strains have shown different patterns of glycosylation in their major surface proteins [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The HA of A(H3N2) IAV has shown a strong trend toward increasing numbers of glycans since its introduction into the human population in 1968 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A,B). While the glycans on the stalk region have been quite constant for the past 50 years with five NLG sites at residues 24, 38, 54, 301, and 499 (numbering is based on the full-length protein), the globular head has undergone dramatic glycosylation modifications resulting in the loss and, more often, in the gain of glycosylation. The number of NLG sites on the influenza virus HA globular head has increased from two (at residues 97 and 181; site 97 was lost around 1975) on pandemic A(H3N2) IAV to up to nine (at residues 79, 97, 138, 142, 149, 160, 174, 181, and 262) on contemporary seasonal strains. The only new NLG site that has been acquired outside of the globular head was at residue 61, located between stalk and head regions.
