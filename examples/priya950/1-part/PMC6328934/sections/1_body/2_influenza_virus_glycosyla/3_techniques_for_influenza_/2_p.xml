<p>Although techniques for comprehensive site-specific characterization of NLG exist and have allowed biochemical verification of the glycans’ presence and their relative abundance at some sites of IAV and IBV glycoproteins [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68–72</xref>], until recently they represented a substantial analytical challenge. In 2018, Cao L. et al. [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] published a much less elaborate protocol for a semiquantitative MS-based method that promises to determine the degree of glycan occupancy at each glycosite and the proportion of N-glycans processed from high-mannose type to complex type. Introduction of this protocol into the ordinary practice of influenza laboratory will improve understanding of glycosylation-associated scientific data.
