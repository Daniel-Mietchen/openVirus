<p>Human infections with hantaviruses result from contact with infected rodents or exposure to virus-contaminated aerosols; Andes virus (ANDV) is the only hantavirus in which person-to-person transmission has been documented so far [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Outbreaks of hantavirus disease are therefore considered to be associated with the primary rodent host and pathogen dynamics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the mechanism of zoonotic pathogen dynamics is complex, and the relationships between or among environmental change, host–pathogen dynamics, and human spillover is far from clear [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, variations in incidence rates are not simply, as expected, a result of changes in rodent demography or virus prevalence [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, although numerous research efforts have been undertaken, no WHO-licensed vaccine against hantavirus infection is available [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (except Hantavax, which is only licensed for human use in the Republic of Korea). Current efforts to curb hantavirus transmission focus on avoiding contact between humans and host rodents [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Due to the complexity of these systems, hantaviruses deserve the attention of research scientists in the contexts of both public health and wildlife conservation.
