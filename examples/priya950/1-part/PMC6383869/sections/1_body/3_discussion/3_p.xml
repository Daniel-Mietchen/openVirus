<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to compare hantavirus disease dynamics, from environmental variability to rodent reservoir and to public health, among the main endemic areas across the globe. This review is timely because of the increasing public awareness of hantavirus diseases in Europe, in particular, over the last years. Limitations of this systematic review were that individual studies had differences—surveillance strategies for hantavirus infections, rodent sampling methods, rodent community compositions, socioeconomic factors, and environmental conditions. Therefore, studies were not all directly comparable, especially among China, European countries, and the US. Additionally, it should be noted that unusual human exposure (like war-induced exposure) to otherwise “normal” environment is an often forgotten risk factor for limited outbreaks [

Besides, there are more recent studies on ANDV-like viruses in South America that explore the environment conditions relevant to the occurrence of the host and the circulation of the virus, scrutinize the evidence for climate sensitivity of related disease risk, and recognize those areas of high risk for humans [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. However, in this review, more attention was paid to longitudinal studies of sufficient scale. Finally, our focus on China in the review reflects the fact that for this country highly comprehensive data exist.
