<p>The dynamics of hantavirus epidemics involve multiple phases, including environmental drivers that influence infectious diseases, transmission in the animal reservoir, and spillover transmission to humans. The complexity of disease dynamics has been highlighted in recent decades by contradicting trends; the incidence of HFRS has decreased in China [

Although pioneering research efforts to study both New World and Old World strains of hantaviruses in rodents have been undertaken, as well as related prevention strategies, it is evident that much work remains to be done. By further studying the transmission dynamics of hantaviruses, better prediction and prevention measures can be implemented to protect human health, and critical insight can be obtained into the ecology of hantaviruses and their rodent hosts.
