<p>Long-term observations on the prevalence of hantavirus infection in rodent hosts are critical to understanding the dynamics of hantavirus diseases in humans. Similarly, analysis of hostâ€“pathogen interactions is important to successfully implement disease control strategies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Hantaviruses are known to be directly transmitted from infected to susceptible hosts (horizontal transmission). Therefore, changes in rodent population densities are expected to increase or decrease the transmission and prevalence of hantavirus infection in rodent reservoir populations, resulting in greater or lower levels of spillover to humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The dynamics of rodent population density and hantavirus infection prevalence are linked by contact rates; the virus may become extinct below a certain host density, corresponding to the minimum number of hosts required for virus maintenance in a population [
