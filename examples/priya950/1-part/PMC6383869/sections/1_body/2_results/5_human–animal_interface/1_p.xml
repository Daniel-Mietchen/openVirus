<p>Human–animal interface constitutes the boundary/barrier for cross species transmission of disease and the environment (including ecological and anthropological factors) within which these species exist [

In the preceding sections, we have summarized the ecological factors and processes that affect hantavirus diseases dynamics; hereafter, anthropological factors will be reviewed, including agricultural activity, human-driven land-use change, and vaccination. In HPS endemic regions of America, agriculture-associated activities were also most commonly reported as potential risk factors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], and seropositive rodents were found with high frequency in agricultural landscapes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Besides, the breeding season of striped field mouse, the local rodent host, is closely associated with agricultural activity. Moreover, it could be concluded that agricultural activity may influence the activity and life cycles of local striped field mouse and in turn shape disease dynamics.
