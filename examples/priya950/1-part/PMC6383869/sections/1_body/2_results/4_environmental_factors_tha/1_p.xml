<p>Environmental factors are major triggers that affect reservoir ecology and virus ecology and thus are likely to affect hantavirus transmission from rodent reservoir to humans (or risk of virus exposure in humans). However, although outbreaks appear to be a result of these factors, it is difficult to predict the exact outcome, chiefly due to the complex and multifactorial mechanisms that drive hantavirus disease outbreaks. Studies have highlighted the importance of the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors in determining hantavirus disease dynamics [

In this section, studies addressing environmental variability and human hantavirus infections were included (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and we mainly review three factors that play an important role in altering hantavirus disease dynamics and have been documented sufficientlyâ€”precipitation, temperature, and landscape alteration.
