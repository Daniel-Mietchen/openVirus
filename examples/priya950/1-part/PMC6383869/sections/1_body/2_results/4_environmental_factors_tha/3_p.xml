<p>However, precipitation can also negatively affect or have no effect on the incidence of hantavirus disease, depending on magnitude and region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In Europe, no clear relationship of rainfall with human hantavirus infections was shown [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], except that one study illustrated rainfall in the summer three years before hantavirus disease incidence increased [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Other studies also demonstrated no significant association between rainfall and hantavirus disease [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Heavy precipitation there may kill rodents by flooding their burrows and nests, thereby reducing host population density and the risk of human exposure to pathogens. Floods could also cause movement of rodent populations (even community-level changes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006901.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]) to new habitats and eventually disease emergence in new sites.
