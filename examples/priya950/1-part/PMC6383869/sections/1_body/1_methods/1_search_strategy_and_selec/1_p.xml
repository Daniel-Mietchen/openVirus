<p>We searched the MEDLINE (via PubMed) online database and Google Scholar for articles with the key words “hantavirus,” “ecology,” or “modelling” in the title, with no date limit, published before 31 July 2017, with restriction to mainly English papers. Key words used in Medical Subject Headings were “hantavirus,” “hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome,” “hantavirus pulmonary syndrome,” and “rodent reservoir.” Inclusion criteria were predefined as research providing information on viral infections (including human incidence, prevalence of hantavirus infections in rodent hosts, and/or host–pathogen interactions), environmental change and rodent reservoir population dynamics, and information on environmental factors that may trigger hantavirus disease outbreaks. Study data extracted included study year, location, hantavirus type, main rodent reservoir, study design, and environmental factors.</p>
