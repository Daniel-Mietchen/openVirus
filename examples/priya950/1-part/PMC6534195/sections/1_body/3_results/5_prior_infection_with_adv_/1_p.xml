<p>AdV-positive episodes tended to protect against subsequent infection with AdV (
 <italic>P</italic> = .090) and also 3 other virus groups commonly encountered in BMT, namely CoV, ERV, and FluV (
 <italic>P</italic> = .062, .093, and .064 respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). FluV–positive FRI episodes significantly reduced the risk of subsequent AdV infection (
 <italic>P</italic> = .044; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Figure 3

 </xref>). Cross-protection between FluV episodes was not apparent in the full data set (

  <italic>B</italic>
 </xref>). However, before routine administration of TIV (ie, on or before 4 October 2010), FluV–positive episodes tended to protect against subsequent FluV infection in enlistees who had not recently received TIV (
 <italic>P</italic> = .081; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Figure 3
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>). None of the other virus groups conferred significant group-specific protection (
