<p>Four hundred twenty-three participants (7.6%) had ≥2 FRI episodes. The median time between consecutive episodes was 34 days (IQR, 21–55 days). While 12.1% in the 19-week BMT intake type had ≥2 FRI episodes, this was unsurprisingly less common for the shorter 17-week (8.5%; odds ratio [OR], 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .55–.84]), 9-week (1.9%; OR, 0.14 [95% CI, .09–.22]), and other (1.9%; OR, 0.14 [95% CI, .07–.30]) intake types. Other factors associated with having ≥2 FRI episodes were Malay and Indian ethnicity (versus Chinese) and being ex- or current smokers (versus nonsmokers). Compared with participants who not recently vaccinated, among whom 10.4% had ≥2 FRI episodes, 7.4% (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, .50–.95), 6.7% (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, .48–.79), and 6.4% (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, .18–1.92) among those who recently received MIV only, TIV only, or both MIV and TIV, respectively.</p>
