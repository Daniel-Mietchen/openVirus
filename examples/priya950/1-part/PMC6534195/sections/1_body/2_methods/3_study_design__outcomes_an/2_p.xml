<p>Other than subsequent consultation for any FRI episodes, additional definitions for events of interest were episodes positive for any of the respiratory viruses tested and specific groups of etiological agents. We grouped the agents by using broad categories that accommodated changes in testing protocol during the study period while reflecting virus taxonomy: adenoviruses (AdVs)—species B, E, and others for which the type was undetermined; coronaviruses (CoVs)—CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, CoV-OC43, and other CoVs; enteroviruses and rhinoviruses (ERVs); human metapneumovirus (hMPV); influenza virus (FluV)—influenza A(H3N2) virus, 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09), influenza A(H1N1) virus, influenza A virus–positive samples for which the subtype was undetermined, and influenza B virus; human parainfluenza virus (hPIV)—types 1–4; and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)—RSV-A and RSV-B.</p>
