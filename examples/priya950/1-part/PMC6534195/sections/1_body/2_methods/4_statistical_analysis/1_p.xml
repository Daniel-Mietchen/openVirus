<p>We present simple tabulations and visualizations of the data at the participant and episode levels, using Ï‡
 <sup>2</sup> and Fisher exact tests where appropriate. We then investigated how FRI caused by specific virus families affected the subsequent risk of FRI episodes relative to those who were unexposed, through Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests, as well as with multilevel survival analyses (with survival time modeled using a Weibull distribution), which adjusted for potential confounders. We also investigated whether exposure to FluV and AdV affected the subsequent risk of all FRI episodes and the risk of FRI by specific pathogens, using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests. However, multivariable analysis was not performed because of sample size limitations when restricting the event of interest to specific pathogens. All analyses used Stata 15 (Stata; College Station, TX), with 2-tailed 
 <italic>P</italic> values of &lt; .05 considered statistically significant.
