<p>Viral interference describes the phenomenon whereby a prior viral infection potentially exerts some effect on subsequent infection with other viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Edward Jenner first reported this when herpetic infections were observed to cross-protect against the subsequent development of vaccinia lesions [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Then, in the 1950s, Isaacs and Lindenmann discovered the role of interferons in viral interference [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since then, cross-protection has been observed for animal viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], with possible mechanisms elaborated on in multiple animal models [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>]. In human populations, time-series analyses have demonstrated how epidemics involving a particular virus influence the temporality of epidemics involving other families of respiratory viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7–10</xref>]. Several case-control and cross-sectional studies also show that co-detection of respiratory viruses is less frequently observed than if the infections caused by different respiratory viruses occur independently of each other [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref>]. However, evidence from studies of sequential infections in humans would provide more-robust evidence that viral infections can reduce the risk of subsequent infection with a different group of viruses and clarify whether such cross-protective effects differ between different types of viruses.
