<p>As previously reported, the rollout of routine trivalent seasonal influenza vaccination in the Singapore Armed Forces was accompanied by a dramatic decline in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections but a much less noticeable decrease in the overall incidence of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) episodes [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A subsequent increase in the incidence of adenovirus infections appeared, at least from time-series data, to account for some degree of replacement for the influenza virus infections averted through vaccination [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this article, we set out to clarify the relationship between specific prior viral infections and subsequent FRI episodes in young Singaporean men undergoing basic military training (BMT). We reanalyzed the Singapore Armed Forces FRI surveillance program data by using survival analyses to assess whether there was any evidence, at the individual level, that infection with particular viruses was conferring short-lived relative cross-protection against subsequent FRI episodes, including those caused by other virus groups.
