<p>Developments in the antiviral strategies and vaccine technology against influenza viruses have been in action to tackle disease outbreaks. Wan et al. in their recent study showed the protective efficacy of a DNA vaccine expressing consensus HEF protein against two lineages of IDV (D/OK and D/660) in guinea pigs. The study showed that the vaccinated animals showed significant titers of neutralizing antibodies against both lineages of IDV and were protected against the intranasal IDV challenge. Although studies in past have shown the potential of DNA vaccines against IAV [
