<p>In the year 2011, an influenza C-like virus was isolated from pigs having a influenza-like illness in the USA. The newly identified influenza D virus shared approximately 50% homology with ICV and also lacked cross-reactivity between antibodies against IDV and human ICV, thus advocating the need of a separate genus in the family [
