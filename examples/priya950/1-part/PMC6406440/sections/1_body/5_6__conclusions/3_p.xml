<p>The novel zoonotic infections are often the result of pathogens crossing the species barrier and infecting novel host species. Although studies have shown that the IDV has not demonstrated a drastic antigenic change over the years, yet the unpredictability of influenza viruses make this type a potential health threat. IDV infections in small ruminants reported from various countries and feral swine population in the multiple states of the USA is an indication that further studies are urgently needed to clearly understand the status of IDV infections in other wild animals and the extent of interspecies transmission. In-depth studies are required to exactly assess the economic impact of IDV infections on the commercial livestock market. The mixed reports for IDV infections in humans further make it important to study the zoonotic potential of IDV, especially in people with occupational exposure to susceptible livestock. Since IDV shows potential to infect a wide range of host after IAVs, its zoonotic potential is a global concern. </p>
