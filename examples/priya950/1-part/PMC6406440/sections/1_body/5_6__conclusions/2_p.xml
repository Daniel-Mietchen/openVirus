<p>Until recently, the influenza C viruses were known to exist as a single subtype with low rates of evolution, but the newly identified IDV (isolated from pigs in Oklahoma) representing influenza-like-illness shared approximately 50% homology to human ICV. In spite of the shared homology, the antibodies raised against IDV did not neutralize the human IAV, IBV or ICV in the serological analysis, and also the IDV showed a broad cell tropism unlike ICV, thus demanding a new genus in the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>. Soon after the identification of IDV, several countries across the globe reported similar viruses circulating in both swine and cattle population.
