<p>Homologies have been reported between IDV and ICV. A group of authors recently utilized the 5′ and 3′ RACE coupled with direct PCR sequencing to show that there is identity between the 3′ and 5′ non coding conservative regions of IDV and ICV with a single difference of adenine at position 5 at the 3′end of IDV while it is cytosine in ICV and a polymorphism at position 1 of the 3′ terminus [

The study further performed a ClustalW alignment of predicted PB1 amino acid sequences and revealed that IDV shared approximately 69–72% mean pairwise identity to ICV and 39%–41% identity to IAV and IBV. Similarly the HEF of IDV and ICV showed higher similarity; however it was lower for PB2, NS1, NP and M1 genes [
