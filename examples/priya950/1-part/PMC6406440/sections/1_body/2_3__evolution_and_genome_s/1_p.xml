<p>The IDV was first identified in pigs and has also been in circulation in cattle and several small ruminants across the world [
 <xref rid="B2-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A recent study has shown that IDV has been circulating as two distinct genetic and antigenic lineages represented by D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK) and D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 (D/660) [
 <xref rid="B55-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The two lineages demonstrate frequent reassortment events with one another and also show antigenic cross-reactivity. Another interesting report revealed that IDV circulating in the bovine population of Japan formed an individual cluster that was distinct from strains reported from other countries, thus raising a possibility of unique evolution and pathology of IDV in Japan [

 <xref rid="B36-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Su et al. also suggests that the IDV clustered most closely with ICV based on the generation of a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree generated from the sequence of PB1 from influenza type A, B, C and D viruses [
 <xref rid="B57-jcm-08-00192" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Another phylogenetic analysis done based on all the seven genes of IDV showed that the IDV isolated from swine and bovine were both closely related and belonged to the D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 cluster [
