<p>ANXA1 can act endogenously as a signaling molecule, or exogenously, by binding to the FPR1, 2, or 3. Endogenously, ANXA1 regulates MAP kinase phosphorylation (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alldridge and Bryant, 2003</xref>), serves as a substrate for EGF tyrosine kinase (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Pepinsky and Sinclair, 1986</xref>) as well as protein kinases such as PKC (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Creutz, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, ANXA1 associates with NEMO, or IKKγ, which in turn regulates NF-κB (
