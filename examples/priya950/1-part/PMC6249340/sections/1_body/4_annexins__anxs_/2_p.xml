<p>There are more than 100 ANXs identified in different species (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Gerke and Moss, 2002</xref>). Approximately 12 of these ANXs have been identified in humans and are assigned Annexin A1â€“A11, and A13 with various tissue distribution and expression (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Mirsaeidi et al., 2016</xref>). The ability of ANXs to bind to phospholipids in cellular membranes provides a possible link for its role in viral infection especially in the regulation of endocytosis and exocytosis (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Enrich et al., 2011</xref>). Different families of ANXs have been shown in the literature to possess various functions during influenza virus infection. ANXA1, ANXA2, ANXA5, and ANXA6 amongst others have been found to play roles in inflammation and lung injury mediated by IAV. Here, we will review the functions of these ANXs, in particular, ANXA1, in the pathogenesis of IAV infection.
