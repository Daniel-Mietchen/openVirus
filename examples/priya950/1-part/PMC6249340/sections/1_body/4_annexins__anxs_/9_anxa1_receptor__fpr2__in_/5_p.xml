<p>In conclusion, it is of interest to mention that the role of FPR2 in IAV infection remains unclear. This may largely be due to its ability to bind a wide range of ligands which affect inflammation differently. The role of FPR2 in IAV can be studied in the context of enhancing inflammation or resolution. In the future, a murine knockout model will be useful in dissecting the contribution of FPR2 to viral pathogenesis, and how this can be exploited to resolve virus-induced inflammation.</p>
