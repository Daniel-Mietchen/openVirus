<p>Nonetheless, IAV has evolved to overcome these innate responses. The NS1 protein is a multifunctional virulence factor that can repress activation of RIG-I, hence controlling antiviral responses by the host in the cytosol (

Moreover, due to the extensive genetic and antigenic diversity of IAV and the ability to undergo genetic re-assortment to infect a large host-range, there is a continuous emergence of new influenza viruses that results in periodic pandemics (
