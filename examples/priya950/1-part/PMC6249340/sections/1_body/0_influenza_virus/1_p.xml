<p>Influenza viruses (IV) are one of the most common contributors to human respiratory infections in terms of mortality and morbidity. While IV infection occurs across all age groups, individuals who are more susceptible to severe disease conditions and complications consist of infants, elderly, people with chronic diseases or are immunocompromised (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2018</xref>). The recurrence of such seasonal influenza epidemics is primarily due to the constant mutation of the virus, reducing the effectiveness of vaccines while increasing human-human transmission (
