<p>In addition to avoiding adaptive and innate immune defenses, zoonotic animal viruses must also successfully interact with and recruit tens to hundreds of host proteins that the virus needs in order to replicate itself in human cells (for example, nuclear import factors, transcription factors, etc.). If the human version of even one of these essential host factors cannot be recruited by an animal virus because of differences in protein sequence between the human and animal version of that protein, then this, too, can impede viral replication. This is probably the main way that immunity to animal viruses differs from immunity to human viruses. Something as simple as a human transcription factor, mismatched to the animal virus attempting to use it, can be as potent in blocking viral replication as an immunity protein would be. For instance, the host transcriptional activator acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member A (ANP32A) is a key cofactor required for influenza virus replication [

As another example, RanBP2 is a component of the nuclear pore complex, and HIV engages with Ran binding protein 2 (RanBP2) to facilitate nuclear entry [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. We have shown that RanBP2 is nonequivalent in sequence and interaction specificities between monkeys, chimpanzees, and gorillas and that this nonequivalence drove the evolution of SIVs as they transmitted into and between ape species, setting the stage for zoonosis to humans and the emergence of HIV (

 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows a collection of human proteins that have been shown to block the replication of animal viruses in human cells. While some of them are restriction factors, others are core housekeeping proteins, such as cell-surface receptors, that are not typically thought of as canonical members of the immune system. Even if these receptors do function in immune signaling, that activity is typically not what is blocking replication of animal viruses. Rather, it’s the inability of animal viruses to physically engage these receptors that impedes virus entry into cells and ultimately viral replication. The final outcome is a highly effective defense against these animal viruses, in some cases conveyed by relatively mundane housekeeping proteins of the host.
