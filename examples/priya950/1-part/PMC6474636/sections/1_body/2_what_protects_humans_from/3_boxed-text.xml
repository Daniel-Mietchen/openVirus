  <title>Box 2. Lessons in zoonosis from the HIV pandemic</title>
  <p>
   <bold>HIV adapted to humans as it emerged from its reservoir in monkeys and apes.</bold> HIV-1 group M, the virus responsible for the HIV/AIDS global pandemic, derives from a reservoir of SIVs found in African monkeys. Monkey SIV first entered African apes via infection of chimpanzees [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This transmission resulted in a new virus of chimpanzees called SIVcpz. SIVcpz was then transmitted to humans, giving rise to HIV-1 group M [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Given the enormity of the pandemic that ensued, these events have been intensely scrutinized by the HIV research community, and this topic has been recently reviewed [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].
  </p>
  <p>We know a lot about how the virus adapted as it moved from monkeys to chimpanzees and then from chimpanzees to humans. For instance, in the adaptation of monkey SIV to chimpanzees, the APOBEC3 family of host restriction factors was key. The SIV/HIV protein Vif neutralizes APOBEC3 proteins in host cells. SIV from monkeys could not neutralize chimpanzee APOBEC3D and APOBEC3G proteins, and so the vial 
   <italic>vif</italic> gene had to adapt before or during this transmission event [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A second host protein, RanBP2, also drove viral adaptation during this transmission event. RanBP2 is part of the nuclear pore complex, and the transmission of SIV from monkeys to chimpanzees required new mutations in the viral capsid protein that enabled the virus to interact with the chimpanzee version of RanBP2 [

  </p>
  <p>Then, during the transmission of SIVcpz to humans, protein sequence differences between chimpanzee and human Tetherin, another host restriction factor, also required viral adaptation. The virus adapted its 
   <italic>vpu</italic> gene, which encodes an antagonist of human Tetherin [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Similarly, human APOBEC3H drove adaptive change in the viral 
   <italic>vif</italic> gene encoding the antagonist for APOBEC3 proteins [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. We don’t know whether these 
   <italic>vif</italic> adaptations were required before the first human infection or afterwards as the virus refined itself for spread in the human population. This is because many people, including many Africans, encode APOBEC3H alleles that do not express high levels of protein [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It’s possible that these individuals provided a lower adaptive barrier for SIVcpz, giving the virus a foothold in the human population and a chance for the resulting HIV to acquire changes in 
   <italic>vif</italic> that subsequently enabled it to infect more humans [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In the transmission of SIVcpz to humans, there was a third key adaptive event in SIV matrix protein, although the host factor driving this adaptation remains unknown [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].
