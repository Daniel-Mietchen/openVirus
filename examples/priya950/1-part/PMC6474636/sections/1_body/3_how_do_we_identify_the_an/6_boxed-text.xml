  <title>Box 3. Lessons in zoonosis from the 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic</title>
  <p>
   <bold>Kids and bats meet in a hollowed-out tree.</bold> In the 2013–2016 Ebola virus epidemic, the index case was a 2-year-old boy in the village of Meliandou, Guinea, who died on December 28, 2013 [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Epidemiological investigation revealed that this toddler and other children in the village liked to play in an old, hollowed-out tree, one that was also the home of a colony of Angolan free-tailed bats (
   <italic>Mops condylurus</italic>; [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]). Although bats have never been definitively shown to be a reservoir for Ebola, this particular bat species has been found to harbor antibodies to Ebola virus in nature [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] and also to survive experimental infections with Ebola virus [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. The tree may have put this boy in contact with infected bat feces or even with an Ebola-infected bat because the villagers reported that the children would regularly catch and play with the bats in this tree. Interestingly, a new ebolavirus, Bombali virus, was recently detected in this same bat species [

   <bold>Did a viral variant arise in this tree that was capable of replicating in humans?</bold> Villagers report that both kids and bats had frequented this tree for many years. So, what exactly happened in December of 2013, when the toddler became infected with Ebola virus? Perhaps the bats in this tree had, themselves, only become infected recently or were shedding higher-than-normal levels of virus for some reason. But there is another possibility. Viruses exist as swarms of related genotypes in nature. These swarms are the pools from which variants with unique abilities can arise. Perhaps one of these bats was harboring a unique viral variant that was poised for success in a human host. We will never know for sure if the bats in this tree harbored Ebola virus or if the virus that they harbored was special in its sequence because the tree was burned before it could be properly investigated [

   <bold>Was Ebola virus perfecting itself for humans as the epidemic progressed?</bold> About 3 months after the first toddler died, sequence data from the epidemic revealed the appearance of a new mutation in Ebola virus genomes recovered from infected patients. This mutation caused a single amino-acid change, A82V, in the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus, which increased viral fusion with human cells via the endosomal receptor NPC1 [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Presumably this virus, which had just emerged from nature, needed to refine interactions with the human ortholog of its receptor, NPC1. Reciprocally, Ebola virus isolated from human patients is incompatible with NPC1 in at least one bat species [
   <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Therefore, adaptation to NPC1 seems to be required during the transmission of Ebola viruses between hosts in multiple directions.
