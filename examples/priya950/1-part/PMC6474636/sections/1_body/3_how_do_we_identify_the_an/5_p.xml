<p>Viral receptors serve as an excellent demonstration of this approach. One of the predominant themes that has arisen in the study of zoonosis is that cell-surface receptors are commonly protecting humans from infection by animal viruses. To identify and enter their target cells, viruses interact with receptors (usually, proteins) expressed on the surface of host cells. We and others have observed that many host receptors for virus entry have evolved under intense selective pressure to modify the protein sequence on their virus-binding surface [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. In these cases, most of the protein sequence is conserved, yet some residues at the virus interaction interface are rapidly evolving (dN/dS &gt; 1; red spheres in

 </bold>). Because of sequence divergence on the surface of cellular receptors, animal viruses often require compensatory mutations in their surface proteins before they can utilize the ortholog of their entry receptor in a new host species (for an interesting recent example, see [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000217.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]). Such adaptations have been well documented for bat coronaviruses, which must adapt to use the human ortholog of their receptor, ACE2 [

Once inside a human cell, viruses potentially have access to everything they need to replicate. Because even a poorly replicating virus has the ability to evolve and adapt, keeping foreign viruses completely out of cells might be one of the most important defense strategies of all. This might explain why receptors have experienced such intense selective pressure.
