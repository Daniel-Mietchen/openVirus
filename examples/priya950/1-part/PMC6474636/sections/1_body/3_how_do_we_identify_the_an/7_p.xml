<p>In summary, receptors and innate immunity proteins are prominent examples of proteins that block the replication of animal viruses in humans. But any cellular protein important to virus biology that has diverged significantly in protein sequence between the animal host and humans has the potential to act as a barrier to zoonosis. Other, unexpected types of host proteins have been identified that are important for viruses but that donâ€™t translate from one host species to the next, such as DNA repair proteins [
