<p>In summary, dangerous animal viruses are those that require few mutations in order to begin replicating themselves in human cells. These viruses are dangerous because the required combination of mutations might randomly arise in the natural reservoir. To identify these dangerous viruses, we must identify the human proteins (restriction factors, receptors, other cellular proteins) that are currently protecting us from each class of animal virus with high zoonotic potential and determine whether those are few or many. Dangerous viruses will be separated from us by only one or a few host blocks. Identifying human blocks to animal virus replication will require significant work, including the integration of viral surveillance with virologic experimentation in the lab. These efforts are worth it, not only because disease emergence is an important public health topic, but because zoonosis provides a unique example of evolution in action that teaches us about biology more generally.</p>
