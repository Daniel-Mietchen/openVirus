   <p id="Par18">Viral replication and clinical signs of influenza were similar between tree shrews and ferrets, although weight loss was only observed in tree shrews. These data show that tree shrews are a useful alternative to ferrets for studies of influenza B viruses, particularly considering their relatively small size, evolutionary relatedness to primates and lower cost compared to ferrets.</p>
