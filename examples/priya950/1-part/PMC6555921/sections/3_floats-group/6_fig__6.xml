  <p>Inoculation of BALB/c mice with influenza B viruses causes inflammation in tissues of the respiratory tract. mRNA expression of IL-6 (
   <bold>a</bold>), IL-8 (
   <bold>b</bold>), IL-10 (
   <bold>c</bold>), IP-10 (
   <bold>d</bold>), TNF-α (
   <bold>e</bold>) and TGF-β (
   <bold>f</bold>) mRNA were increased at 2, 4 and 6 days post inoculation (DPI) in tissues of the respiratory tracts of mice inoculated with influenza B virus. The Yamagata strain B/Guangzhou/12/2016 elicited greater increases in the expression of IL-6 at two days post inoculation (DPI) (
   <bold>a</bold>), IL-10 at two and six DPI (
   <bold>c</bold>), IP-10 at all time points (
   <bold>d</bold>) and TNF-α at 6DPI (
   <bold>e</bold>). mRNA expression was detected via real-time PCR (SYBR Green) using GAPDH expression as a control. Fold changes are in comparison to uninoculated animals. Mice were inoculated with either Yamagata strain B/Guangzhou/12/2016 (Y12) or Victoria strain B/Guangzhou/0215/2012 (V0215)
