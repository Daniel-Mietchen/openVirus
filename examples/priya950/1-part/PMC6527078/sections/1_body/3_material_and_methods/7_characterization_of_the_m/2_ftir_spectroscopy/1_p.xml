<p>An IR Prestige 21 FTIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) was used for chemical analyses of the functional groups of the IgY antibody, ALP enzyme, and IgY-ALP bioconjugate. IgY-ALP, IgY, and ALP were measured separately in universal attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode. FTIR spectra were obtained with 10 scans per sample ranging from 4000 to 750 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> and a resolution of 4 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>.
