<p>Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained using a QM-4/2003 Quanta Master Steady State Spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, London, Canada) operating in quanta-counting mode. The slits of the excitation and emission monochromators were adjusted to 1–2 nm. The excitation wavelength was set to 280 nm, and the maximum fluorescence intensities of the emission spectra were measured with the five repeats between 320–340 nm.</p>
