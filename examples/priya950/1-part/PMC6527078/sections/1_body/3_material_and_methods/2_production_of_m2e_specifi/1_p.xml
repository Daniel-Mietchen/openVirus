<p>In total, 20 
 <italic>Lohmann Brown</italic> hens (22-weeks-old) were used in this study. There were two experimental groups: the control group and treatment group. In total, 15 hens were immunized with influenza A virus, and five hens were used as the control group. The hens of the control group were injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Hens in the treatment group were immunized with the M2e peptide dissolved in PBS and emulsified in Freund’s adjuvant. The subsequent booster doses of peptide emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant were given at two-week intervals after the first injection. IgY was isolated with polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000; Sigma-Aldrich) using a precipitation method [

Then, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000 was added to the egg yolk and vortexed three times at 3.5%, 8.5% and 12% (w/v), respectively. In each step, following centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min (13,000 × g, Hettich® 320R Fixed Angle Rotor), the supernatant was poured and filtered. Finally, the extract was dissolved in PBS and dialyzed against a 0.1% saline buffer (w/v) overnight. Subsequently, affinity chromatography was performed to obtain M2e-specific IgY antibody.
