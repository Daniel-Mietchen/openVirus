<p>EZ1 Virus Mini Kit V 2.0 (QIAGEN, Germany) was used for viral RNA extraction. The extraction process was performed in an EZ1 Advanced XL device following the manufacturer’s instructions. Influenza A, influenza AH3, influenza AH1, influenza AH1pdm, RNase P forward primer and reverse primer, and probe sequences for rRT-PCR were prepared according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol by TIB MOLBIOL (Syntheselabor GmbH, Berlin, Germany). According to this protocol, ‘Matrix’ was selected as the target region for the detection of influenza A. The hemaglutinin gene region was selected for sub-typing. The primer sequences are as shown in

 <xref rid="CIT0044">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0045">45</xref>]. Positive control samples were provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). Amplification was performed using LightCycler 480 II (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) with Real Time ready RNA Virus Master enzyme mixture (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). For each sample, 5 µl RNA isolates were added to 15 µL mixtures prepared with 8.6 µL molecular water, 0.5 µl primer, 1 µL probe, 0.4 µl enzyme, and 4 µL reaction buffer. Amplification conditions were as follows: 8 min at 50 °C, 30 s at 95 °C (0.1 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, 0.1 s at 72 °C) × 45 cycles, and 30 s at 40 °C.
