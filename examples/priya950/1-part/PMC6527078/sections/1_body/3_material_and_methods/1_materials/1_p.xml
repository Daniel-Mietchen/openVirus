<p>Chickens were immunized with antigen which is the synthesized peptide sequence (influenza A M2e (98% purity)), commercially purchased from Bio-Synthesis (Lewisville, TX, USA). The peptide sequence was NH
 <sub>2</sub>-Met-Ser-Leu-Leu-Thr-Glu-Val-Glu-Thr-Pro-Ile-Arg-Asn-Glu-Trp-Gly-Cys-Arg-Cys-Asn-Asp-Ser-Ser-Asp-OH. The molecular weight of the peptide was 2756.02 g/mol. ALP from bovine intestinal mucosa buffered aqueous solution (2,000–4,000 DEA units/mg protein) and glutaraldehyde solution (Grade II, 25% in H
 <sub>2</sub>O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PBS buffer and PEG 6000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for the purification of the eggs. Carboxylink™ Couplink Gel (Prot: 20266; Thermo Scientific, USA) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC; Sigma-Aldrich, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used for affinity chromatography. PBS buffer, coupling buffer, PBS-T solution, and blocking buffer were used for ELISA. The PBS buffer for ELISA was prepared from Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>(12H
 <sub>2</sub>O) (Merck), (KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>) (Merck cat no. 7778–77-0), KCl (Merck cat no. 7447–40-7), HCl (Merck), NaOH (Merck), and NaCl (Duchefa Biochemie, cat no. 7647–14-5). The coupling buffer consisted of Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no.497–19-8), NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> (Merck, cat no. 144–55-8), NaN
 <sub>3</sub> (Meck, cat no. 011–004-00–7), HCl (Merck), and NaOH (Merck). Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>(7H
 <sub>2</sub>O) (Merck, cat no. 7782–85-6)), NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>(2H
 <sub>2</sub>O) (Duchefa Biochemie), Tween-20 (Merck) were used to prepare the PBS-T solution. In addition, bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to PBS to obtain the blocking buffer. The substrate, paranitro phenyl (pNPP) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-cat No. 0009001789).
