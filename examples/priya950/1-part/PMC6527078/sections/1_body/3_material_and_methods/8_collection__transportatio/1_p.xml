<p>Fourty-two nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained within the first 72Â h after patients were diagnosed with ILI and brought to the laboratory by a courier system at Istanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Medical Microbiology Department, Virology and Basic Immunology Unit of the Influenza Reference Laboratory. Swabs without PCR inhibitor and with a synthetic tip and plastic handle (polyester or dacron) were used during the collection of the samples. The specimens were collected with Virocult transport medium (Medical Wire Equipment Co., Corsham, United Kingdom), which removed the cold chain requirement. In the laboratory, all procedures were carried out in the laminar flow cabinet. Viral RNA extraction was performed. On the same day, positive and negative samples were identified by rRT-PCR.</p>
