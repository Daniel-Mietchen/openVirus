<p>Influenza A virus constantly changes its structure, however the M2e peptide, which is composed of 24 amino acids, is highly conserved among human influenza A viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. In particular, the N-terminal epitope of M2e, SLLTEVET (residues 2–9), is conserved among all subtypes of influenza A viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. Furthermore, M2e is highly expressed on infected cell surfaces and exhibits antigenic properties. Therefore, M2e-specific antibodies can bind to cells infected by the virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>] . For this reason, the M2e peptide is considered to be an excellent tool for the diagnosis of influenza A virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>].
