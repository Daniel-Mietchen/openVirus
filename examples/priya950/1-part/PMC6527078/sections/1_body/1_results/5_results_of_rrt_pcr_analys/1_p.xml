<p>Forty-two nasopharyngeal specimens were used and the results of real-time PCR were evaluated according to the amplification results. The Light Cycler 480 II system makes a logarithmic calculation as the efficiency will be 2. The samples that have a cycle point (Cp) value for the real-time PCR curve greater than 15 and smaller than 35 are evaluated as positive. It is important that a smooth amplification curve is generated. However, no amplification curve exists in the negative samples; the curve is a straight line on zero. At the end of the analyses, 26 of the samples were negative and 16 of the samples were positive.</p>
