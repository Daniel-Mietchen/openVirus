<p>The conjugation reaction can be explained by examining the incorporation of new functional groups or the loss of functional groups, the sharp peaks of the major functional groups, or the decrease in peak intensities in FTIR spectra of the constituent components of the bioconjugate. Therefore, the bioconjugate formed by the conjugation reaction can be characterized by FTIR spectroscopy.</p>
