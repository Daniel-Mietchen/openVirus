<p>Another indication of the bioconjugation was that the amid II band of the M2e-specific IgY-ALP bioconjugate (
 <xref rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>) had a higher intensity than the amid II bands of M2e-specific IgY antibody at 1,537 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and ALP enzyme at 1,556 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The shifting value of the peak was 6 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> according to the spectrum of the M2e-specific IgY antibody.
