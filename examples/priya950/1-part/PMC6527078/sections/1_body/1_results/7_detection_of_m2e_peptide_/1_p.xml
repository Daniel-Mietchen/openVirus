<p>Direct sandwich ELISA was used to evaluate the specific binding of the M2e-specific IgY-ALP bioconjugate in samples tested positive or negative for influenza A. The cut-off value of the data was around 0.26. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>, six H3N2 and seven H1N1 swab samples had high positive values and one H1N1 and two H3N2 swab samples were close to the cut-off value. The diagnosis results of 42 nasopharyngeal swab samples analyzed using the rRT-PCR method were consistent with those of the samples evaluated using the M2e-specific IgY-ALP bioconjugate.
