<p>Studies in the literature showed the value of M2e peptide for the diagnosis of the influenza virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0039">39</xref>] and our present study also showed the diagnostic potential of M2e antibody instead of as a peptide antigen. Consequently, the results were in agreement with literature findings, which indicate the potential of the M2e peptide as a diagnostic marker that can detect different types of influenza A viruses.
