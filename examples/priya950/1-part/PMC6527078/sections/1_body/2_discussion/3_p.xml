<p>M2e peptide and M2 protein have been used to diagnose or produce specific antibody by different researchers. Ingrole et al. used M2e peptide to produce antibody in mice regarding the highly conserved structure of M2e [
 <xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. However, we obtained a high amount of IgY antibodies against M2e (not mammalian). In addition, many diagnostic studies have been conducted with M2e peptide. As an example, M2e (2â€“24) peptide was used for the serodiagnosis of H5N1 in one of these studies and they showed the broad reactivity of post-infection sera against M2e peptide [
