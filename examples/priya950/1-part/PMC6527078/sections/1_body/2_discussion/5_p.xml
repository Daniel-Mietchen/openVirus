<p>This study aims to demonstrate that the production of influenza A virus M2e peptide sequence-specific IgY antibody, which was not previously available in the literature, and the applicability of the conjugate of this IgY antibody and ALP enzyme, for influenza A diagnosis in ELISA. Thus, a novel diagnostic method involving the use of the anti-M2e-specific IgY antibody for the detection of influenza A virus was developed. The results obtained suggest that the M2e-specific IgY-ALP bioconjugate may be used as a rapid and specific diagnostic tool for influenza. The ‘detection efficiency and sensitivity’ parameters are important and definitely need to be researched before we can produce a diagnostic kit in our future studies.</p>
