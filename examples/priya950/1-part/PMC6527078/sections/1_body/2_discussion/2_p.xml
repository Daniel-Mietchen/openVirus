<p>In this study, IgY antibody, which is specific for influenza A M2e peptide antigen, was conjugated with ALP enzyme in the presence of glutaraldehyde. After the antibody-enzyme bioconjugate was characterized by spectroscopic methods, its use in virus detection was evaluated with nasopharyngeal swab samples, previously identified as positive or negative by rRT-PCR, using the direct sandwich ELISA method. Nasopharyngeal swab samples positive for both H1N1 and H3N2 were successfully detected using the M2e-specific IgY-ALP bioconjugate. The results are theoretically as expected since the M2e peptide sequence is a common region among most influenza subtypes including H1N1 and H3N2. In some cases, despite being positive, the absorbance was high, whereas others were close to the cut-off value. This may be caused by the virus amount in the nasopharyngeal swap samples taken from different patients. The results of all negative samples were also consistent with rRT-PCR results.</p>
