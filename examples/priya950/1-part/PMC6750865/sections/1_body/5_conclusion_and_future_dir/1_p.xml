<p>Many questions about microcephaly induced by ZIKV remain. However, investigations of several mechanisms of cell injury involved in the immunopathogenesis of ZIKV infection suggest that there is a link between microcephaly and cell death in which the neuroinflammatory response in situ can induce apoptosis, necrosis, and pyroptosis and consequently result in brain atrophy. In vitro triggering of the necroptosis, paraptosis, and autophagy enhance death of neuronal and glial cells. Therefore, identification of these mechanisms enables the discovery of several immune-targets for anti-ZIKV therapeutic intervention. However, we emphasize that studies in vivo need to be performed to confirm this hypothesis. In summary, we propose an integrated model that synthesizes the relationships among these underlying mechanisms (
