<p>With respect to apoptosis, extrinsic and intrinsic pathways act jointly to enhance cell damage. In the extrinsic pathway, cytokines, growth factors, and death ligands induce the activation of death receptors responsible for initiate the intrinsic cascade. Activation of the intrinsic cascade results in mitochondrial damage that alters the electron transportation chain, provokes the formation of pores in the membrane where cytochrome C is released to bind with Apaf1, and forms the apoptosome complex responsible for activating a series of caspases that direct the cell to apoptosis.

 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Classic apoptosis leads to a process of natural cell death in which the host defense system induces various mechanisms to maintain homeostasis, without causing major damage; in microcephaly cases, apoptosis induces the uncontrolled death of neurons and glia cells at several stages.
