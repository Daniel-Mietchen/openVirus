<p>Recent experimental studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that several mechanisms of cell injury are involved in the immunopathogenesis of ZIKV infection. These studies suggest that there is a link between microcephaly and cell death resulting from the neuroinflammatory response, whereby apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, paraptosis, and autophagy increase the death of neuronal and glial cells and, consequently, result in brain atrophy and ZIKV-induced microcephaly.</p>
