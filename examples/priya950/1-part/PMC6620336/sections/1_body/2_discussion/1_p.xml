<p id="Par14">The phylogenetic analysis in this study determined that CHIKVs in Colombia belong to 3 clusters of the Asiatic genotype: Panama (Caribbean Colombia, Huila), Nicaragua (Cauca and Risaralda) and St. Barts (Bogotá, D.C). Our results are similar to previous research that used complete sequencing of worldwide strains and a Bayesian phylogenomics approach

 </sup>. In this sense, the previous analysis including three Colombian viral genomes, two from Sincelejo (Sucre) (KU365372.1-KU365373.1) and one from Bogotá D.C, identified a similar phylogenetic relationship between Panama and St. Barts, respectively
