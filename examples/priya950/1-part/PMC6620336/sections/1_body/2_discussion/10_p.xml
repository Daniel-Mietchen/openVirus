<p id="Par23">The detection of polymorphisms A5356G, C6676T and G7787A (aa.C-R78Q) in strains isolated more than two years apart (2014 to 2016), suggests that the CHIKV of Saint Bart and Colombia is a variant within the Caribbean American clade (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Interestingly, the G7787A mutation (aa Capside-R78Q) was also detected in the car-89 strain of Cartagena (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This finding in strain Car-89 may have been the result of an error-matched viral RNA polymerase, or due to a recombination event, which has already been reported for CHIKV and other alphaviruses. In this study, we have no certainty of what could have happened, and neither were analyzes performed to detect possible recombinant events. It would be interesting to investigate if this variant still circulates in Colombia and if additional mutations have occurred from 2016 to 2019.
