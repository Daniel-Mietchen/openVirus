<p id="Par21">It is difficult to determine how the Nicaraguan strain reached the South West of the Andean region of the country (Risaralda and Cauca). One possibility is that the strain entered from Nicaragua through the Island of San Andres since the border is only 233 km away and San Andres is one of the most visited tourist sites by people of the Andean area of Colombia (Fig.

Unfortunately, in this study, it was not possible to include strains of San Andres thus not allowing us to make inferences about this phenomenon of viral circulation.
