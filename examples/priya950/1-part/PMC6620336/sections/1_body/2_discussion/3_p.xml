<p id="Par16">When analyzing the polymorphisms, the mutations nsP2-C-2305-T and nsP2-C-2139 and (AA, nsP2-V153A) confirmed the phylogenetic relationship between the isolates of Panama, the Colombian Caribbean, and Huila (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The mutation nsP3 G-4324-T suggested that the strains of Panama, Colombian Caribbean, and Huila could come from Venezuela, the United States, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic or Honduras (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Of the countries that make up this clade, the Dominican Republic was the first country to report cases of indigenous transmission of CHIKV (February 2014)

With the information systems of migratory passenger mobility and the surveillance system in Public Health of Colombia, it was possible to establish that during May and July 2014, infected travelers from the Dominican Republic arrived in Panama and Colombia respectively (Epidemiological Bulletin Colombia)

 </sup>. This epidemiological information suggests that the route of introduction to the Colombian Caribbean was through a strain that was circulating previously on the Dominican Republic and later was introduced to Panamá, Colombian Caribbean, and Huila.
