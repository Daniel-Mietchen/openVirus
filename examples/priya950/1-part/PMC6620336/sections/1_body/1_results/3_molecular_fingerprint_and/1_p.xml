<p id="Par10">Within the Caribbean American clade (CAC), the Colombian strains were grouped into three subclades with strains of different geographical origins. Each subclade had branch support of value 1 (posterior probability 1), indicating a genuine relationship between grouped strains. i. the Panamanian strain (KR559486-2014) was close to those of the Colombian Caribbean (SJ-Mahates, Cartagena, Ovejas, Planeta Rica, Sincelejo) and Huila; ii. The Nicaraguan strain (KY703969-2014) was close to Risaralda and Cauca; and iii. St. Barts strain (KR559497-2014) was closely related to two Colombian strains, one reported in Bogota and the other one of unknown origin (Fig.
