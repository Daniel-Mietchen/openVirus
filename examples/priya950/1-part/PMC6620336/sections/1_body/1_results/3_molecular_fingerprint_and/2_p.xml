<p id="Par11">After phylogenetic analysis, polymorphic sites that allowed subclade grouping were found into the strains from America and the Caribbean Islands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). It was observed that the strains of CAC had 8 polymorphic sites; those modifications were different from the ancestral Asiatic strains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Within the CAC, some polymorphisms allowed differentiation into sub-clades from different countries (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In the case of the Colombian strains and phylogenetically close ones (Nicaragua, Saint Barts, Panamá), it was observed that the mutations T3308C (aa. nsp2-Y543H), G3840C (aa. nsp2-G720A) and T5445C (aa. nsP3-L458P) were only present in the strains of Nicaragua, Risaralda, and Cauca. The mutations nsP3-A5356G, nsP4-C6676T, and capsid-G7787A (aa. capsid-R78Q) were present in 3 isolates from St. Barts, Bogotá and unknown Colombian strain with no geographic description in GenBank. The nsP3-G4324T mutation appeared in the strains of the Dominican Republic, USA (Florida and California), Puerto Rico, Honduras, Venezuela, Panama, the Colombian Caribbean, and Huila. Additionally, T2139C (aa. nsP2-A 153 V) and nsP2-C2305T mutations were detected in the strains of Panama (KR559486), Colombian Caribbean and Huila (Figs
