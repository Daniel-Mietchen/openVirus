<p id="Par13">When comparing the strains of Risaralda and Cauca with that of Nicaragua (KY703969), 18 unique mutations were detected, one of which produced a change in the amino acid sequence (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). 50% (n = 9/18) of the substitutions occurred in the non-structural proteins and 50% (n = 9/18) in the structural proteins. We found 3 polymorphic sites in nsP1 (2 ti + 1 tv), 2 in nsP2 (2ts), 4 in nsP4 (4 ts), 2 in E2 (2ts), 1 in 6 K (1 ts) and 6 in E1 (4 ts + 2 tv) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The strains of St. Barts and Colombia contained two polymorphisms (2ts + 2tv) of which one produced a change in the amino acid sequence (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).
