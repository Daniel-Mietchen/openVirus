<p id="Par12">When we compared the sequences with the closest phylogenetic strain, 40 variable sites were detected between the Panamanian strain (KR559486) and those from SJ-Mahates, Ovejas, Cartagena, Planeta Rica, Sincelejo and Huila (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Of the 40 sites, 37 were unique mutations, and 11 produced changes in the amino acid sequence (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). 72% (n = 29/40) of the substitutions occurred in the non-structural proteins and 28% (n = 11/40) in the structural proteins. We found 5 polymorphic sites in nsP1 (4 ti + 1 tv), 8 in nsP2 (7 ti + 1tv), 7 in nsP3 (5ti + 2tv), 9 in nsP4 (7ti + 2 tv), 4 in capsid (4 ts), 3 in E2 (3ts), and 4 in E1 (3 ts + 1 tv) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The strains with the most variable sites were those from the Planeta Rica (Córdoba) and Huila, with 12 and 9 polymorphisms, respectively.
