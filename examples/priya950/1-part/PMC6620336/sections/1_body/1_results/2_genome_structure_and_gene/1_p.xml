<p id="Par9">For each sequence, an average of 35,574,564 paired reads (32,021,178 and 40,904,884) and 3,602,990,602 read bases were obtained. The percentage of GC was 49%. The 16 genomes were assembled with an average length of 12062 (11,394 to 12,347) nucleotides. The average percentage value of the coding regions of the genome (ORF) of CHIKV was 28.8% adenine (A), 25.9% guanine (G), 20.6% thymine (T) and 24.7% cytosine (C). As reported for other CHIKVs, the sequences contained two open reading frames of 7410 nt and 3744 nt that encode the nonstructural polyprotein (2470 aa nsP1-nsP4) and the structural polyprotein (1248 aa E1-E3, 6 K, C), respectively. The length of genes of the strains and the percentage of homology concerns to reference genome LN898093 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Sixty polymorphic sites were detected among the Colombian sequences (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The 70% (n = 42) of the substitutions occurred in the non-structural proteins and 30% (n = 18) in the structural proteins. We found 8 polymorphic sites in Nsp1 (6 ti + 2 tv), 13 in Nsp2 (11 ti + 2tv), 9 in Nsp3 (6ti + 3tv), 12 in Nsp4 (10ti + 2 tv), 4 in capsid (4 ts), 4 in E2 (4ts), 1 in 6 K (1ts) and 9 in E1 (6 ts + 3 tv). Sixteen out of the 61 polymorphisms were non-synonymous substitutions, and of these, 4 were parsimoniously informative, and 12 were non-informative (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
