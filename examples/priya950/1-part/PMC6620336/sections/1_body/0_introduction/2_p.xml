<p id="Par3">The study of whole genome sequences of CHIKV isolates from different regions of the world has facilitated an understanding of the evolutionary history of this virus
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. The first phylogenetic studies of CHIKV identified three geographically associated genotypes: West Africa (WA), East/Central/South Africa (ECSA) and Asia (AS)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. However, in the years 2005–2006 a new descendant from the ECSA, the Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) was described
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. IOL developed a higher affinity for the 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> vector, resulting from the E1-A226V, E2-I211T, E1-T98A and E2-L210Q mutations
 <sup>

 </sup>, and was associated with the massive epidemics of 2005–2006 in the Indian Ocean Islands and the Indian subcontinent
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. Since the outbreaks in India and the Indian Ocean, CHIKV has spread worldwide, and the locations of epidemics have changed drastically
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. In 2007, the first outbreak of transmission in Europe was reported in Italy and in 2013, the first cases in the Caribbean island of Saint Martin
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. In January 2015 CHIKV was disseminated to 42 countries or territories in the Caribbean, Latin America and North America (Florida)
