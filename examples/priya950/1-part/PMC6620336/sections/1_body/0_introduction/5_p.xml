There is evidence that some Asian strains in the Colombian Caribbean are already exhibiting nucleotide substitutions in proteins nsP1 and E2 20, but it is unknown if there are variations in other regions of the viral genome that are associated with autochthonous vectors or the clinical manifestations of patients.
