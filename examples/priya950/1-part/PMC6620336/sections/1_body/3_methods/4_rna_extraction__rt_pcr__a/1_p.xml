<p id="Par30">The RNA was obtained from 140 μl of the supernatant of the cell cultures using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, France), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. For the synthesis of cDNA, M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (200 U/μl, Promega) and Random Primers (0.5 μg/μl, Promega) were used. For the confirmation of CHIKV in viral cultures, TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (2X) (Applied Biosystems) was used. For each reaction, 10 µl of 2X buffer were added; 0.18 µl of forward primer (final concentration 0.9 µM); 0.18 µl of reverse primer (final concentration 0.9 μM); 0.1 µl of probe (final concentration 0.25 μM); 4.54 µl of RNase-free water and 5 µl of cDNA. As positive controls, a culture of CHIKV confirmed by conventional PCR was used; ultra-pure water served as a negative control. Samples with a Ct less than or equal to 38 were considered positive</p>
