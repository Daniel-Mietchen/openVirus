<p id="Par29">The 57 sera were cultured onto C6/36 and Vero cells, maintained in 12.5 cm2 flasks, in Leibovitz 15 and DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) media respectively. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 2 µg amphotericin B. C6/36 cells were incubated at 28 °C and Vero cells 37 °C under 5% CO2. For viral isolation, 40 µl of serum were added to confluent monolayers of C6/36 or Vero cells and incubated for 1 hour at 28 °C and 37 °C respectively. After viral adsorption, the sample was removed, and 3 ml of medium supplemented with 2% FBS was added and incubated at 28 °C or 37 °C according to the cell line. At the end of 14 day or following early recognition of the cytopathic effect (CPE), the cellular supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C. All the cell culture procedures were carried out at Biological Research Institute of the Tropic of the University of Cordoba with equipment’s and efficient practices of a level of biosafety II, that involve infectious or potentially infectious material.</p>
