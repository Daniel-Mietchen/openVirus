<p id="Par31">16 viral isolates of CHIKV were selected based on their geographical origin: Cartagena n = 7, San Joaquin-Mahates = 1, (Department of Bolivar), Ovejas n = 4 (Department of Sucre), Planeta Rica n = 1 (Department of Cordoba), Department of Risaralda n = 1, Department of Cauca n = 1, Department of Huila n = 1 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For amplification of the CHIKV genome, twelve sets of primers previously reported by Stapleford 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The primers amplified overlapping regions of the retrotranscribed genomes. The PCR reaction was carried out with the Exact Taq PLUS 2X Mastermix. The amplified products were verified by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel using SYBR safe DNA Gel Stain. The amplicons of each sample were mixed in equimolar concentration, to avoid unequal distribution of data in the steps of library preparation and sequencing.
