<p>We addressed these questions through an in‐depth quantitative assessment of a standardized and systematically assembled database of 2,542 HCV antibody prevalence studies on more than 49 million individuals across 24 countries, which to our knowledge is the largest HCV epidemiology database worldwide. Our overarching aim was to provide the scientific evidence necessary to inform policy and strategic prioritization and resource allocation of programming across MENA countries, the majority of which fall under the umbrella of LMICs. The criticality of this analysis arises from the fact that ill‐informed and inefficient testing could have a serious and crippling budgetary impact and may diminish the political enthusiasm to scale up testing and treatment.
