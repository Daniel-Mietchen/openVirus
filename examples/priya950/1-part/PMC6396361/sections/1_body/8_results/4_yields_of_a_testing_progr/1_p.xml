<p>The yields in a testing program, i.e., the number of individuals needed to be tested to identify one chronically infected individual, are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="hep41310-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref> for each population epidemiologic category for each country. For PWID, the number needed to be tested to identify one case ranged from 1.4 in Libya to 5.3 in Lebanon, with a median of 2.5. For countries with a generalized epidemic, it was 2.5, and for those with a concentrated epidemic, it was 2.8. For the MENA region as a whole, it was 2.7.
