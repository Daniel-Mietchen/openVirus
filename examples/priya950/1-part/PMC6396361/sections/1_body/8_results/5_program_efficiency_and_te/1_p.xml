<p>The efficiency of the testing program is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="hep41310-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. For countries with a generalized epidemic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="hep41310-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A), the highest program efficiency was achieved by targeting populations with liver conditions, where only two individuals needed to be tested to identify one chronically infected individual. The expansion path curve was also largely flat by expanding the program to include PWID, populations with high‚Äêrisk health care exposures, and special clinical populations; only two to four tests would be needed to identify one chronic infection. However, the curve edged upward with expansion of the program to include populations at intermediate risk and general populations, indicating diminishing returns, although still only 10 to 15 tests would be needed to identify one chronic infection.
