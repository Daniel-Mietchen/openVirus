<p>In conclusion, population risk of exposure depends on whether the type of epidemic is generalized or concentrated. Risk of exposure varies immensely by population and shows a distinctive hierarchy in concentrated epidemics, but a less distinctive hierarchy in generalized epidemics. These findings indicate different test‐and‐treat strategies by epidemic type. In all countries, however, testing strategy should be targeted with prioritization determined by risk of exposure. Populations with liver conditions, clinical populations, and PWID should be at the core of every testing strategy. These findings inform the development of testing guidelines at the country and regional levels, thereby attending to the GHSS strategic directions to ensure program efficiency and sustainability of HCV programs.</p>
