<p>Based on analyses of a massive and systematic database of prevalence measures, we estimated the risk of exposure to HCV in the MENA region, quantified the yields of testing, and furnished a roadmap for efficiently rolling out testing programs, all for the purpose of expanding treatment coverage. The results demonstrated that major gains can be attained through a targeted approach that factors in epidemic type and is tailored to each country, thereby optimizing testing and treatment within budgetary constraints. Such a targeted approach has an additional indirect benefit of effectively curtailing transmission, as populations with a higher risk of exposure are also the same populations that are more likely to pass the infection to uninfected persons. Although the analyses are specific to MENA countries, the results are probably generalizable to other LMICs and regions with similar epidemic patterns.</p>
