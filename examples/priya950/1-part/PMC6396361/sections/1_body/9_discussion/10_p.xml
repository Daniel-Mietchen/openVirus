<p>The provided strategies for testing are based on an epidemiologic perspective. However, other considerations can affect implementation of testing programs. Testing prioritization policies should follow treatment policies and take into consideration the availability of treatment for HCV. Testing strategies also need to factor in the ease of identifying populations at different risks of exposure as some populations may be difficult to identify and target. The size of each target population also needs to be considered. The size of the target population is an important factor; for instance, the size of PWID in a specific country may be too small relative to the overall size of the infected population, thereby affecting consideration, optimization, and logistics of resource allocation.</p>
