<p>The inverse variance weighting method was used when estimating pooled HCV prevalence. However, sensitivity analysis adding country population size for weighting data had no impact on our estimates for the pooled prevalence or related measures (yields of a testing program and RRs). Another method for weighting data, such as by time, could have also been considered. Yet, epidemic time‐trend data were too limited for most countries to inform weighting that factors the epidemic’s temporal evolution. Overall, data were most complete only for Egypt and Pakistan, the two countries with generalized yet strikingly different epidemics.
