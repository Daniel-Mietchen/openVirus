<p>Targeted facility‚Äêbased testing may be gradually introduced to identify clinical populations most at risk (such as dialysis or transfusion patients). Testing can later be extended to other clinical populations (such as hospital inpatients) as resources become available. Of note is that populations with liver conditions also had a high risk of exposure. Despite the variability in risk by epidemic type, this testifies to the role of HCV in liver disease in the MENA region.</p>
