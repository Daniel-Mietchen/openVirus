<p>With the identification of those infected becoming probably the leading challenge for HCV response in the MENA region and elsewhere, we aimed to address who should be tested for HCV so that test and treat programs could be scaled up efficiently and effectively, targeting those most likely to be carriers. Against a dearth of studies on HCV testing in LMICs,

 <xref rid="hep41310-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> we addressed specific questions for the MENA region: (1) Which populations are at higher risk of having been exposed and therefore should be tested? (2) What are the yields of a testing program targeting different populations? (3) How can testing programs be efficiently expanded? The yield of a testing program is defined here as the number of individuals needed to be tested to identify one chronically infected individual.
