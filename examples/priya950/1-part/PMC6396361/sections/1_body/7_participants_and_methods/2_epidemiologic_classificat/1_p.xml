<p>Prevalence studies were classified into six epidemiologic population categories based on an established population classification for the perceived risk of being exposed to HCV infection

 <xref rid="hep41310-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> Based on this classification, prisoners were considered a population at intermediate risk because they can be exposed to HCV through practices such as tattooing, piercing, or anal sex. Importantly, a proportion of prisoners also could be people who inject drugs (PWID), with this proportion varying immensely from one setting to another.

 <xref rid="hep41310-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> Patients with HIV were classified based on the status of the HIV epidemic in each country. Specifically, they were considered at high risk whenever the epidemic was dominated by iatrogenic transmission (injecting drug networks, such as in Iran, Libya, and Pakistan)
 <xref rid="hep41310-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> and at intermediate risk whenever the epidemic was dominated by sexual transmission.
