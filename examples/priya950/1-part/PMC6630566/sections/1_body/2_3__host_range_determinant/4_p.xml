<p>The viral HA is synthesized as a polyprotein called HA0 that is cleaved into HA1 and HA2 domains at a conserved arginine residue; this cleavage is required for infectivity. The HAs of human and most avian IAVs are cleaved by trypsin-like proteases that are present in the respiratory tract of humans and GI tract of birds and this determines the tissue tropism of IAVs in these species. Some H5 and H7 avian IAVs acquire a motif of several basic amino acids in the HA cleavage site (multibasic cleavage site, MBCS), resulting in a HA that can be cleaved by non-trypsin like proteases and furins that are present in a much wider range of tissues [

Viruses bearing highly cleavable HAs cause a rapidly fatal, multi-system infection in poultry that is called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Avian IAVs that lack the MCBS are referred to as low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses [
