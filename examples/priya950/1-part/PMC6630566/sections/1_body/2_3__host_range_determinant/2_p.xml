<p>The viral haemagglutinin (HA) plays several important roles in IAV infection. First, it is the attachment protein of the virus and secondly, it has to be cleaved by tissue proteases for infectivity. The HA binds to its receptor, sialic acid (SA), on the surface of the host cell to initiate viral entry. The HAs of avian IAVs preferentially bind SAs linked to galactose by an α2,3 linkage while HAs of human IAVs preferentially bind α2,6-linked SA [
