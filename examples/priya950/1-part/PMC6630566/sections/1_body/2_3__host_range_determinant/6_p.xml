<p>The virally encoded polymerase complex, a heterotrimer of three polymerase proteins (PB2, PB1 and PA) is responsible for the replication of the viral genome. Key host-range determinants have been identified in the PB2 protein, notably at amino acids 627 and 701 in PB2 in avian origin viruses [

 <xref rid="B19-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and importin-Î± proteins that are involved in nuclear transport of many cellular proteins are examples of host factors that play an important role in determining species specificity of IAVs [

Furthermore, erroneous polymerase activity during viral RNA replication of some influenza viruses can lead to the production of short aberrant RNAs, referred to as mini viral RNAs that can act as innate immune agonists and trigger cytokine dysregulation [
