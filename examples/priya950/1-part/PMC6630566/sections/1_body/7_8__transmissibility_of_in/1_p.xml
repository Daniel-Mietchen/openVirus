<p>The molecular determinants of the transmissibility of influenza viruses are not well understood. Epidemiologically successful IAVs, e.g., seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, transmit efficiently from person to person while those that fail to do so cause sporadic infections. Ferrets and guinea pigs are the two animal models that are most widely used to evaluate the transmissibility of IAVs. Typically, the ability of IAVs to be transmitted to a naïve cage-mate (contact transmission) and to a naïve animal in an adjacent cage separated from physical contact with the infected animal by a mesh (airborne transmission) are assessed. While seasonal influenza A viruses transmit by contact and airborne transmission, avian H5N1 and H9N2 viruses fail to transmit by the airborne route [
