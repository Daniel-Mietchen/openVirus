<p>Studies on reverse genetics-derived viruses have led to the identification of specific residues and/or gene segments that play a role in transmissibility. The presence of Î±2,6 SA binding in the HA and lysine at residue 627 in the PB2 protein were critical determinants of transmissibility in the 1918 H1N1 virus [

 <xref rid="B38-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] contributed to the transmissibility of the H1N1pdm09 virus. The HPAI H5N1 virus has not been seen to transmit from person to person in nature and is not transmissible in the ferret model. In separate studies, Imai [

 <xref rid="B40-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] demonstrated that H5N1 viruses that became transmissible after passage in ferrets had acquired mutations in the HA that enhanced the thermal and acid stability of the protein. It is possible that the phenotype of transmissibility may be achieved by different mutations in different IAVs.
