<p>In summary, there is a large, diverse reservoir of IAVs in nature, from which, on rare occasions, novel viruses are introduced into humans. In most instances, these cross-species incursions cause sporadic infections that range in severity from mild to severe and fatal. On four occasions in the last 100 years, a novel IAV derived from a bird or pig infected humans and spread efficiently from person to person to cause an influenza pandemic. The global impact of influenza pandemics drives scientific efforts to understand the barriers to interspecies transmission at the level of the virus and the host. It is important to elucidate how some IAVs cross the species barrier and, furthermore, why a small subset of those are able to go on to cause a pandemic. </p>
