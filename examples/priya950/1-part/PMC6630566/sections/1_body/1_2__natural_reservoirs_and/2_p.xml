<p>The IAV genome is comprised of eight gene segments of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA. The enormous genetic diversity of influenza viruses in nature is a result of an error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that lacks proof-reading function, and genetic reassortment, whereby progeny viruses can acquire one or more novel gene segments when a host cell is co-infected by two different IAVs. These processes lead to antigenic drift and antigenic shift in IAVs, both of which occur continuously in nature.</p>
