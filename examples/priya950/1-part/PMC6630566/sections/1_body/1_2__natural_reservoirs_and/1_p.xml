<p>Influenza A viruses infect many different species in nature, including water fowl and shorebirds, wild birds, chicken, turkeys, pigs, horses, dogs, cats, bats and humans [

 <xref rid="B3-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Waterfowl and shorebirds are believed to be the natural reservoir of IAVs, because (i) viruses of many subtypes (16 HA and 9 NA subtypes) have been isolated from them, (ii) infection is usually asymptomatic and (iii) viruses are generally in ecological stasis in these species [
 <xref rid="B5-tropicalmed-04-00072" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast to avian hosts, other species including pigs, horses and humans are infected by relatively few IAV subtypes. For example, classical swine influenza (which refers to H1N1 virus infection in pigs), H1N1pdm09 and H3 viruses infect pigs, H3 and H7 subtypes have caused equine influenza and sustained epidemics in humans have only been caused by H1, H2 and H3 IAV.
