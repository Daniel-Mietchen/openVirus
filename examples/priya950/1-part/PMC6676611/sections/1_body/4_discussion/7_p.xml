<p id="Par38">There are some limitations in this study. First, molecular typing was done in only 24 and 30% of all HAdV isolates, in 2011 and 2014 respectively through random sampling. But, the number of viral isolates chosen for further genotype in each epidemic is relative large compared with all other studies conducted in Taiwan during the same period of time. Also, our genotype distribution result is compatible with other epidemiological studies in Taiwan in 2011 [

Although viral culture had been replaced by nucleic acid detection using multiplex PCR in many developed countries, it is more expensive and not yet covered by Taiwanâ€™s health insurance system.
