<p id="Par18">Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are double stranded non-enveloped DNA viruses which cause a wide range of illnesses including acute respiratory infections (ARIs), gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and meningoencephalitis. HAdV infection accounts for 5–7% of respiratory illnesses in children and infants [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. HAdV-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) may be severe and lead to long term respiratory sequelae, such as bronchiolitis obliterans or bronchiectasis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. HAdVs were an important cause of acute respiratory tract infections in Taiwan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that the most susceptible populations were children &lt; 5 years old, close-quartered populations such as schools and military training camps, and immunocompromised individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Currently, there are more than 60 serotypes of HAdVs, classified into 7 species (A-G). Molecular typing of HAdVs is based on PCR-based direct sequencing of the HAdV hexon gene which contains 7 hypervariable regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Different serotypes were associated with different clinical manifestations and various degrees of disease severity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Serotypes 3, 4, 7 and 21 have been reported to be associated with severe disease, and HAdV7 was related to post-infectious pulmonary sequelae, such as bronchiolitis obliterans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Molecular genotyping of HAdV was used to analyze the dynamic changes in epidemiology and the association with disease manifestations [
