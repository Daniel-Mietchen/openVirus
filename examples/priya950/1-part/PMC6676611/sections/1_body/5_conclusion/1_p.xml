<p id="Par39">We found co-circulation and emergence of different HAdV genotypes in the 2011 and 2014 epidemics. The 2011 epidemic was mainly caused by HAdV genotype 3 and 7 and had more gastrointestinal symptoms, while the 2014 epidemic was caused by genotype 1, 2, 3, and 7 and had more upper respiratory tract infections. Underlying disease and high CRP levels were independent risk factors of hospitalization in both epidemics. Understanding the changes in epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HAdV epidemics is important from a public health perspective.</p>
