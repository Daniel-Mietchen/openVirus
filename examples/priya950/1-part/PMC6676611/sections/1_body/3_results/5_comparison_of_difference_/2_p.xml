<p id="Par31">There were 29 patients diagnosed with HAdV pneumonia in the two epidemics. We compared the demographics and clinical characteristics of these 29 patients with non-pneumonia patients (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). There were no significant differences in age or gender between these two groups. However, a significantly higher percentage of pneumonia patients had co-infections compared to non-pneumonia patients (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012). Among the co-infections, viral infection (75%) was more predominant than bacterial infection in the pneumonia group. Pneumonia patients had significantly higher mean WBC counts (11,334.8 vs. 7515.1 cells/μL, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and CRP levels (98.9 vs. 62.2 mg/L, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.046), but lower mean ALC (1697.9 vs. 2484.7 cells/μL, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) compared to non-pneumonia patients. There was no significant difference in genotype distribution between pneumonia patients and non-pneumonia patients.
