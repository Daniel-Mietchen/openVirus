<p id="Par29">Multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify the risk factors associated with each epidemic was listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. In the 2011 epidemic, the risk of hospitalization was significantly increased in patients with underlying disease (OR = 2.747, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.015), cough (OR = 1.959, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.017), and increased CRP values (OR = 1.015, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In the 2014 epidemic, the risk of hospitalization was significantly increased in patients with co-infections (OR = 5.944, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.011), bronchiolitis/ bronchopneumonia (OR = 2.505, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.024), underlying disease (OR = 18.187, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), diarrhea (OR = 2.056, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.037), vomiting (OR = 2.413, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003), increased WBC counts (OR = 1.00006, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.018) and increased CRP values (OR = 1.007, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007). Using a cutoff value of CRP = 60 in univariate logistic regression analysis, in the 2011 and 2014 epidemics, the risk of hospitalization was significantly increased in patients with CRP values &gt; 60 (supplementary Table S1; OR = 2.333 and 2.833, respectively, all 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Underlying disease and elevated CRP level were independent risk factors for hospitalization in both epidemics.
