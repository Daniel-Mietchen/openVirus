<p id="Par21">This study retrospectively enrolled pediatric patients with virologically-confirmed HAdV infection who presented at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH), a national university-affiliated, 1200 bed teaching hospital, which is also the major tertiary referral center in southern Taiwan. This study enrolled patients (&lt; 18 years old) who were diagnosed with HAdV between Nov. 2010 to Dec. 2015. HAdV infection is defined based on the presence of HAdV isolated from clinical specimens, including nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat or nasal swabs. The patient list of HAdV infections was abstracted from the hospital-based administrative electronic data. Patients without complete clinical information available for analysis and adult patients were excluded. The NCKUH virology laboratory is one of the contracted laboratories of the nationwide viral surveillance system of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Taiwan. HAdV epidemics are defined as HAdV-positive rate above 7.0% for six consecutive weeks according to baseline epidemiological surveys [
