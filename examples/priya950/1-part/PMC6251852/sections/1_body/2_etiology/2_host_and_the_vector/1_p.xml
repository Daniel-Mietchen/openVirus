<p id="Par11">Two different transmission cycles exist for the CHIKV, namely the sylvatic cycle seen mainly in Africa and the urban cycle that was initially seen in Asia but is also now found in Africa. CHIKV is maintained in nature by the sylvatic cycle, with monkeys, rodents, baboons and birds serving as reservoir hosts. Human beings replace these wild animals as reservoirs during periods of epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] The most effective vector for human transmission is 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], while 
 <italic>Ae. furcifor</italic>-
 <italic>taylori</italic> is the predominant species for transmission in animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is readily infected by CHIKV, its transmissibility is low [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However a mutation found in the E1 protein of CHIKV (A226V) has enabled this virus to eliminate its cholesterol dependence, thereby achieving better viral uptake, replication and transmission by 
 <italic>Ae.. albopictus</italic>, which has a wider geographical distribution than 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. This led to an explosive outbreak of CHIK in the Indian Subcontinent post 2006 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The vector competency of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has also been enhanced by adaptive mutations in CHIKV involving E2 and E3 substitutions which enhance the initial infection of the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> midgut by CHIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].
