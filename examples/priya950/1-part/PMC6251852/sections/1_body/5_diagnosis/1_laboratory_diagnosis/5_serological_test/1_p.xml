<p id="Par26">Sero-diagnosis relies on the ability to demonstrate a fourfold increase in CHIK IgG titre between the acute and convalescent phase sera or to detect IgM anti CHIKV antibodies in acute phase sera, in the absence of concurrent circulation of other agents producing a similar disease syndrome (in which case CHIKV infection would have occurred up to months earlier and another infection may be the current infection). IgM anti-CHIKV antibodies are elevated in the blood of infected patients as early as at 5 days of infection and they remain elevated for 3–6 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Anti-CHIKV IgG is detectable only after 2 weeks of infection and remains elevated for 6 months.
