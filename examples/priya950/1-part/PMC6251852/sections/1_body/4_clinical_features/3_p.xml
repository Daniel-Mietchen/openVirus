<p id="Par17">Polyarthralgia begins 2–5 days after the onset of fever and is mostly symmetrical, involving predominantly the distal joints including wrists, ankles and small joints of hands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Arthritis may sometimes involve the large joints, such as the knee and shoulder. CHIK arthritis has also a predilection to affect both early and more severely those joints previously damaged due to trauma or degeneration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The joint pain is particularly devastating in terms of severity, almost immobilizing the patient and at times even preventing sleep during the first few days of the illness. The severe pain leads to the characteristic stooped posture from which the disease derives its name. Joints are extremely tender to touch in many patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The arthritis persists for varying periods of time. In the pervious study conducted by the authors, the arthritis resolved within 1 week in 25% of patients and within 1 month in 60% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The most common joints affected in that patient population were the ankle (98%) and small joints of hands (93%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Periarticular soft tissue swelling with or without tenderness is a common feature of CHIK arthritis and close to 90% patients in the authors’ study had this manifestation; spine and sacroiliac joints were rarely involved although 21% patients had history of low back ache at disease onset [
