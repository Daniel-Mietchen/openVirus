<p id="Par27">Because of the high volume of blood needed and difficulties in blood transportation to remote areas, as well as quickly-spread and large-scale of Zika virus epidemics, it is not practical to import blood from low-risk regions to supply most endemic areas. So, safe and cost-effective technology was urgently needed to guard blood supply safety. The existing blood donor-screening ZIKV NAT assays demonstrate excellent sensitivity [

Fortunately, many studies have shown that amustaline/glutathione treatment for red blood cells can effectively inactivate Zika [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], Dengue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and Chikungunya virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and other methods aimed at red blood cells were under clinical trials and promising to be applied in the future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Cost of screening and PRT assays is another crucial concern before carrying out a policy. Although the screening assays are high-cost, the adoption of a new system could be effective for many viruses and thus eliminating other existing tests along with their costs, so that the total costs would not be increased greatly. Blood donations NAT screening and PRT were strongly suggested in Zika virus-endemic areas. Given 39% of asymptomatic donors showed symptoms postdonation, it will be helpful to develop follow-ups after blood collection. Areas with no capacity to provide screening assays to all blood donations and non-endemic areas should strengthen general inspection measures, such as detailed questionnaire survey before donation and screening tests should focus on at-risk recipients, such as pregnant women.
