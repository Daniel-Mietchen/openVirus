<p id="Par25">Through this meta-analysis, we concluded the overall prevalence of ZIKV in blood donations was 1.02%, which is higher than DENV RNA (around 0.19% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]~ 0.4% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]) and CHIKV RNA (0.36–0.42% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]) detected in blood donors, and much higher than the rates of window period infections detected by NAT screening for HIV, HCV and HBV over the past two decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) have categorized dengue as high priority agents in terms of threats to US transfusion recipient safety [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Zika virus should also be classified as high-risk agent according to the criteria and even severer than dengue for its possible permanent neurological damage. Routine nucleic acid testing for WNV was performed for all US donations in 2003 and prevented thousands of WNV transfusion-transmissions, more than 27 million donations were tested during transmission periods with 1576 WNV RNA-positive donations identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], which is much lower than the rate of ZIKV prevalence in blood donations we summarized here. The virus load of ZIKV in blood donations in included studies ranged from 10
 <sup>2</sup>~10
 <sup>7</sup> copies/ml, even though the dose required to cause infection in a recipient is unknown due to few recipients were investigated and the difficulty to confirm a TT case excluding vectorial transmission, the virus load is much higher than WNV screened in blood donations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Thus, since routine blood screening test was already implemented for WNV, ZIKV should also be taken into consideration, especially in ZIKV-endemic areas.
