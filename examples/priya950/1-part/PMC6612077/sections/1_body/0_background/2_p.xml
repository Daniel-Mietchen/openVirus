<p id="Par10">ZIKV is transmitted to humans mainly through Aedes mosquitoes bite, but it can also be spread by sexual activities, maternal-fetal pathway, physical contact and blood transfusion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. ZIKV RNA has been detected in blood, semen, saliva, urine and other biofluids samples, but the viremia period of ZIKV is not definite. It was estimated that the median incubation period for the infection was 5.9 days and the virus was detectable in blood for 9.9 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Notably, ZIKV RNA can persist in serum up to 54 days in some cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. So, asymptomatic infectors in viremia period can be a nonnegligible source of ZIKV transmission and largely increase the risk that blood donations were already contaminated before collection.
