  <title>In order to ascertain if the other properties of the bait affected the affinity of the baits and fragments, we performed a principle component analysis (PCA) with the baits’ GC content, melting temperature (Tm), Gibbs free energy, sequence identity between bait and genome, and bait pull down efficiency measured by mean genome coverage.</title>
  <p>The samples from DENV1 (n = 143), DENV-4 (n = 27), and ZIKV (n = 162) cohort was used for this analysis. The first PCA component contains baits‘ GC and Tm, which are highly correlated (loading score of -0.659 and -0.663, respectively). The second PC component contains sequence identity and mean genome coverage that are highly correlated (loading score of 0.723 and 0.673, respectively). This suggests that the bait’s pull-down efficacy in term of mean genome coverage depends only on the bait’s sequence identity with the target genome.</p>
