   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007184.g002">Fig 2</xref> (consisting of DENV1, 2, 3 and 4, CHIKV and ZIKV) was used to group the baits and genome targets based on their nucleotide identity: A) &gt;95% identity (n = 111), B) 90–95% identity (n = 32), C) 85–90% identity (n = 10) and D) 80–85% identity (n = 25). The x-axis represents a 480 nt window of the genome with the bait at the center and the y-axis represents the stacked depth of coverage. Baits designed for DENV1-4 are represented as D1, D2, D3 and D4. The 95–100% identity group has a symmetric, Gaussian distribution when compared to the rest of the groups. In contrast, at 80–85% identity, the baits do not as effectively pull down their target region which is evident by the skew in distribution away from the center of the bait. This skew in the distribution of reads depth around the bait is likely due to the influence of a neighboring bait with a higher percent identity to its target region. For example, in the DENV2 sample at the genomic region between 8800 and 9100, the Bait-018-D2 bait hybridizes with 97.5% identity and zika_bait-43 (bait designed for ZIKV) binds with 81.2% identity and they overlap by 20 nt. Hence, for the 80–85% identity group, which includes the DENV2 genomic region enriched by zika_bait-43, has a skew towards the neighboring bait (Bait-018-D2) as it has higher binding identity. It should be noted however, that although the ZIKV bait binds at a lower efficiency, it is contributing to the coverage of DENV.
