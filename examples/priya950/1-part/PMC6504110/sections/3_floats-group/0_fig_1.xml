  <title>Overview of BaitMaker.</title>
  <p>BaitMaker has two modes, Conserved and Exhaustive mode to design 120 nucleotide (nt) baits for targeted genome enrichment methodology. (i) Conserved Mode: To generate conserved baits, complete or nearly complete viral genomes sequences were download from NCBI database. The mode generates baits for virus species at the region that is most conserved at species-level and present across the different strains. These conserved baits were identified by k-mer based search and clustering algorithm (PriMux) with the allowed number of six mismatches for bait hybridization. The baits were prioritized if the bait can target at least 70% of the sequences from NCBI. Assuming the sequencing library size is 300 nt, the overlapping baits within 500 nt were removed to get non-redundant conserved baits. For DENV, 65 conserved baits were generated. (ii) Exhaustive Mode: To generate exhaustive baits, viral sequences greater than 1000 nt were download from NCBI database. This mode generates all possible baits targeting all the sequences in the viral database and thus contains baits targeting all the different viral strains. Similar to the conserved mode, the overlapping baits and baits within 500 nt were removed. Then iteratively new baits were designed for the regions with no baits giving an exhaustive list of baits targeting all the genomic variation across different strains.</p>
