<p>One particularly important benefit of utilizing a targeted enrichment approach over a Sanger sequencing or an unbiased metagenomic approach, is the number of reads specific to the viral genome are substantially increased and thus allows for assessment of intra-host genetic diversity. These data are particularly important for the analysis of low-frequency variants that may represent precursors to a change in overall pathogenicity [
