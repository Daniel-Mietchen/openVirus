<p>Targeted viral genome enrichment followed by high-throughput sequencing is an approach to enrich viral genomes present in meager quantities in clinical samples. The targeted-enrichment methodology uses biotinylated DNA baits, 120 nucleotides (nt) in length that are complementary to the viral genome. Commonly used algorithms to design baits generate tiled, overlapping baits across conserved genomic regions selected by multiple sequence alignment [

While effective, these methodologies can generate redundant and overlapping baits, which serves to increase the cost of the methodology in practice. In order to minimize the number of baits necessary to capture a target viral genome, we developed a new computational method called BaitMaker. BaitMaker generates non-overlapping baits at an interval of 500 nt in the viral genome. This interval was chosen under the assumption that an average deep sequencing library size ~300 nt and one bait can pull down two overlapping 300 nt DNA fragments. Hence, our approach differs from similar methodologies where placements of baits are tiled across the target genome [

In order to ameliorate the potential impact of reducing the number of baits available for capturing a targeted viral genome, BaitMaker incorporates a k-mer based pattern search and clustering strategy against a viral strain database (e.g. NCBI) to identify both conserved and diverse regions in the viral genome. BaitMaker then utilizes this information in one of two modes to design baits: (i) In ‘Conserved mode’, BaitMaker designs baits targeted to the species-level conserved regions whereas in (ii) ‘Exhaustive mode’, BaitMaker designs baits for both the conserved regions as well as regions with strain level variations.
