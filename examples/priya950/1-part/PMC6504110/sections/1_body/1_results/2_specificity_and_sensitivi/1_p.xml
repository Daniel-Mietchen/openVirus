<p>To create a virus capture panel targeting DENV1-4, CHIKV and ZIKV simultaneously, we pooled the 87 baits (65 targeting the conserved regions, 22 targeting the variable regions) specific to DENV1-4, the 67 baits specific to ZIKV and the 53 baits specific to CHIKV for a total of 207 baits. To assess whether we could effectively capture the targeted viral genomes in the context of high host background, we infected HuH7 cells with DENV1, 2, 3 or 4, Vero cells with ZIKV and BHK-21 cells with CHIKV. To simulate a higher level of host contamination that would potentially be found in clinical samples, the supernatant was discarded from these cultures and total RNA was extracted from the infected cell monolayers and Illumina libraries were constructed from the total RNA. These libraries were then divided in half where the first half was sequenced directly, and the second half was enriched with our bait panel prior to sequencing. The resulting sequencing reads from both conditions were then mapped against the reference genome for each respective strain. Overall, we observed an average 2-log increase in percentage of sequencing reads mapped to the viral genome following enrichment in the DENV1-4, CHIKV and ZIKV samples (
