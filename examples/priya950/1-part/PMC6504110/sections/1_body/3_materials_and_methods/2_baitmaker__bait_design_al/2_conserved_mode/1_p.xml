<p>We downloaded available DENV1-4 sequences using the keyword search "txid12637 [Organism:exp] AND 1000:12000 [slen] NOT clone NOT cloning NOT vector NOT chimeric" and retrieved 11,152 sequences from NCBI. In order to retrieve full or nearly full genomes, we sub-selected the sequences with sequence length greater than 3/4
 <sup>th</sup> of the maximum sequence length found for DENV in NCBI database. Some of the sequences deposited in NCBI are redundant and this may lead to overrepresentation of a specific sequence in our sub selected dataset. Hence, in order to get a diverse set of sequences representing DENV, we selected the sequences with at least two different values out of the seven metadata terms (sequence length, host, strain name, collection date, isolate name, country, strain taxonomic ID) to design baits. We then designed baits targeting the conserved regions using the PriMux software [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], a k-mer based search and clustering method to generate all possible overlapping 120 mers with a one nucleotide sliding window for the set of sequences within each DENV serotype. This k-mer approach ensures that for identical 120 mers present in different genome sequences, these 120 mers are grouped and a common 120 nt bait is designed to target them. As the hybridization process between the bait and viral DNA fragment is tolerant to mismatches, we permitted six mismatches out of 120 nt in the bait’s design. In NCBI, sequences less than full-genome length represent most of the known virus diversity, therefore, we prioritized the selection of the k-mers if it could target at least 70% of the NCBI sequences with at most six mismatches (95% identity). To further reduce redundancy in our bait design, we removed the 120 mers that overlapped or were within a 500 nt distance. This is based on the assumption that with an average library size of 300–500 nt, a 120 nt bait would be able to pull down at least two fragments of length 300 nt overhanging the 120 nt bait (300 nt + 300 nt -120 nt = 480 nt). Thereby, we designed 14 conserved baits for DENV1, 16 for DENV2, 19 for DENV3 and 16 for DENV4. However, few regions in DENV genome were highly variable, and therefore we designed 22 baits explicitly targeting a selected reference genome from South East Asian DENV cohort.
