<p>To capture regions of greater diversity in the viral strains that cannot be captured by conserved baits, we developed “Exhaustive mode” to design baits targeting all the sequences in NCBI. We used the virus name and a minimum sequence length of 1000 nt to extract sequences from NCBI. In addition, we also removed sequence with these terms (clone, cloning, vector or chimeric) in the sequences’ metadata to ensure that the baits are not designed against vector sequence. For CHIKV and ZIKV, we designed baits such that they would capture all the known variations present in the viral strains, inclusive of partial genome sequences deposited in NCBI. The Exhaustive mode of BaitMaker is an iterative process; first, 120 nt baits complementary to genome spaced at a distance of 500 nt for each NCBI sequence are generated. After the initial baits are designed, CD-HIT [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], is employed to cluster and remove redundant baits. As hybridization remains efficient with even with a degree of mismatching between the bait and target sequences, we clustered the baits within a mismatch threshold of 18 nucleotides (85% identity) and 12 nucleotides (90% identity) for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively. For remaining regions with no baits, the process was iteratively repeated until all regions within each target sequence was covered. A final pass of CD-HIT is then run to remove any redundancy in the bait panel.
