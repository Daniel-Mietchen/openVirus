<p id="Par22">We described incidence of ICU SARI admissions during complete season-years and we described ICU SARI characteristics during defined influenza epidemics: incidence (cumulated over the epidemic weeks), rate (per 10,000 inhabitants), the contribution of the separate diagnoses to the syndrome, mean APACHE IV score, in-ICU SARI mortality, ICU SARI peak incidence (i.e. the highest registered weekly SARI incidence during an influenza epidemic), and the SARI/ILI ratio (the number of SARI per ILI case). All of these variables except for the APACHE score are proposed by the WHO. Characteristics were also stratified by age groups (15–44, 45–59, 60–64, and 65+ years). As the coverage increased over time, for comparison, we standardized the SARI incidences to the total number of medical ICU admissions in 2015/2016, when the NICE registry had near-complete national coverage. This was done by multiplying ICU SARI cases by the factor required to adjust the total number of medical admissions in each respective year to the total number of medical admissions observed in 2015/2016. The incidence of ILI was standardized to the size of the covered sentinel population of 2015/2016 (yearly coverage approximates 0.7% of the Dutch population, fluctuating slightly from year to year [

Due to the near-total coverage of the adult ICUs in 2015/2016 we used the standardized incidence and Dutch population-size data to calculate ICU SARI rates in the Dutch population. We estimated the ILI rates in the total adult Dutch population by extrapolating the coverage (~ 0.7%) to the total Dutch population size (yearly). Time series were depicted graphically and we calculated coefficients (Pearson chi-squared or Spearman’s rank where applicable) for correlation between time series.
