<p id="Par26">The diagnoses contributing most to SARI admissions were those registered as “Pneumonia, bacterial” (59% of SARI) and “sepsis, pulmonary” (25%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, with a figure of weekly trends per diagnosis shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) and proportions were slightly lower in 15–44-year-olds than in the older age groups. The distribution varied somewhat from season-year to season-year, most notably for “Pneumonia, viral” (1–11%) and for “Pneumonia, bacterial” (56–65%) and the proportions are shown in a table in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. The proportion of “Pneumonia, viral” increased with decreasing age (registered in 3.5% of people age 65+ up to 8.5% of 15–44-year-olds) and “Pneumonia, aspiration” was relatively more common in the youngest group (18% of 15–44-year-olds vs 11% overall, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
