<p id="Par32">During the eight different influenza epidemics, the proportion of in-ICU deaths among all medical ICU admissions was 14–18%. Among ICU SARI admissions the variation was slightly greater at between 13% (2010/2011 epidemic) and 20% (2007/2008 epidemic) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), and mortality usually increased with increasing age except in the 2007/2008 epidemic when mortality was higher in the 15–44 year age group (16%) than in the 45–59 and 60–64 year age-groups (12%). Within the age groups, ICU SARI mortality also varied by epidemic: 2–16% in 15–44-year-olds to 16–25% in the 65+ age group. There was hardly any correlation between the proportion of ICU SARI deaths and the duration of the influenza epidemic (
