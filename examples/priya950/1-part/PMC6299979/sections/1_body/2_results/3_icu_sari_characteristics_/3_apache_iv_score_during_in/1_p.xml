<p id="Par31">On average the mean score from the APACHE IV model (higher scores corresponding to more severe illness) varied between 71 and 78 between the epidemics and was usually higher with increasing age (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>) (note that age is factored into the score). The 2007/2008 epidemic was an exception, with the inverse being observed in the youngest three age-groups. The average APACHE IV score per influenza epidemic varied most in the youngest age group at 51–74 (2010/2011 and 2007/2008), and varied least in the 65+ age group at 77–82 (2013/2014 and 2009/2010 respectively) (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> for a table of these scores); the order by season mostly did not coincide in the different age groups.
