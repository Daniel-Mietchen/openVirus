<p id="Par15">The most important complication of influenza virus infection is pneumonia (primary viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While costs can be high, the precise burden remains a blind spot [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Such burden information is crucial for prevention and response considering that vaccination, the main control measure against influenza infection, is aimed at preventing complications. A severe influenza season may also lead to hospital capacity problems, especially in ICUs. In this study we analyze comprehensive retrospective ICU data to fill the current knowledge gap.
