<p id="Par35">Weekly medical ICU admissions were higher when SARI admissions were higher (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) indicating that pressure on ICUs is expected to be higher in respiratory seasons. During the eight influenza epidemics under study, ICU SARI peaked at (min, max) 101 up to 188 ICU admissions in one week in the Netherlands. This is an almost twofold difference in peak-incidence between some seasons. Preparedness for severe or unusual seasons or outbreaks includes ICU capacity preparedness. The current situation in the Netherlands relies on crisis management when hospitals are to be overwhelmed. Whether and how often this occurs is not known due to lack of SARI surveillance. A SARI surveillance system might provide better insight into the location of potential bottlenecks and provide potential time gain allowing capacity planning instead of on-the-spur crisis management.
