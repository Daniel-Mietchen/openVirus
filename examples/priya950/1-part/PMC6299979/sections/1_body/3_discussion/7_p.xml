<p id="Par39">As the most severe outcome of any disease, mortality data, if available, could provide an important indication of flu season severity. Mortality can be high in pneumonia hospitalizations, but to date the burden of influenza mortality remains uncertain and is estimated mostly from modeling studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Fatal outcome may be more prevalent in influenza-positive SARI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In our study, in-ICU mortality in patients with SARI during influenza epidemics varied between 13% and 20%. To what extent this reflects differing severities of influenza seasons is not entirely clear because SARI can be caused by different respiratory pathogens, patients may die after their ICU or total hospital stay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and shifts in afflicted age groups can impact mortality numbers. In a German study, mortality in hospitalized patients with SARI (thus not only in the ICU) was lower (5-year-average 11%), but also included non-flu weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Future exploration of a more comprehensive mortality measure than in-ICU deaths (i.e. 30-day mortality or survival to hospital discharge) would improve the estimate of influenza impact.
