<p id="Par37">In terms of the highest extremes, notable influenza epidemics are those of 2007/2008, 2012/2013, and 2014/2015 for different parameters. The 2014/2015 epidemic was the longest recorded (20 weeks) and corresponded with the highest ICU SARI and ILI incidence but not with highest values of other ICU SARI characteristics. The highest peak of ICU SARI (188 in one week, standardized) was in the 2012/13 epidemic (16-week-long epidemic). In contrast, the 2007/2008 epidemic was much shorter (8 weeks) but had the highest ICU SARI/ILI ratio as was also reported in the USA [
