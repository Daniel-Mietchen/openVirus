  <p>Framework of potential novel computational design. The summarized potential approaches combine the epidemiologic triad of infectious diseases. From host perspective, data on host characteristics are modeled to understand the susceptibility and immune response to influenza viruses by studying the host immunogenetics, for example, the antibody repertoire analysis or the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) structure analysis. From virus perspective, phylogenetic modeling is to understand the evolutionary history and patterns of viral genetic and phenotypic characteristics. Further, developing phylodynamic modeling, generalized linear model (GLM), and other more advanced models are critical to identify important epidemiological and ecological determinants that affect viral evolution and host immunity to influenza virus. In order to generate critical components for vaccine design and accurately predict viral evolvability, all three perspectives are combined to form a machine learning pipeline to incorporate information and learn from these data and models. Evidence from experimental tests on these components can be used into machine learning pipeline to improve outputs. Many iterations are needed with input of more information. The ultimate goal is to generate high-quality information and broad-reactive components for a universal vaccine of influenza viruses.</p>
