<p>Another way to identify potential broadly reactive antigens is ancestral sequence reconstruction, which is to computationally infer ancestral gene sequences and the translated ancestral protein sequence (

 <xref rid="B103-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Ancestral sequences can reveal conserved functions of the pathogen protein where the potential cross reactivity of the ancestral virus would also be evolutionarily conserved [

Phylogenetic evolutionary models have been used to infer influenza viral evolutionary history for decades with molecular data, including the analysis of large phylogenetic trees, complex evolutionary models for more accurate ancestral inference and detection of the imprints of selection pressure in molecular sequences [

 <xref rid="B106-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Phylogenetic algorithms have been developed to reconstruct ancestral sequences for broadly-reactive vaccine design [

 <xref rid="B107-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. This phylogenetic approach with marginal reconstruction yields the maximum likelihood at the site with a specific amino acid after comparing all probabilities of different amino acids at a site on an internal node [
 <xref rid="B107-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. It can more accurately account for sampling bias and the variability of substitution rates among sites that can affect the consensus approaches described above.
