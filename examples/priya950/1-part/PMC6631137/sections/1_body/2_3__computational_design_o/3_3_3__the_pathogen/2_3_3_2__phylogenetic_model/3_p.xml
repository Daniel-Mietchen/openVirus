<p>The functional and structural domains of pathogen protein can be under disparate immunologic pressures and thus have impacts on the evolutionary phylogeny [

 <xref rid="B112-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], may help to efficiently identify and select target antigens for universal vaccine design [
