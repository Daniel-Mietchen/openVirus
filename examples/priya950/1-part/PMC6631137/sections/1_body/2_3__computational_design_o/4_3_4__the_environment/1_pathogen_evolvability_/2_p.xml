<p>Furthermore, the complements between phylodynamic modeling and experimental testing can be integrated together to improve prediction on influenza virus evolvability. For example, experimental studies designed to assess viral evolvability [

 <xref rid="B127-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] demonstrated that a measured fitness score or estimated tolerance for mutations can be used in phylodynamic modeling to link phenotypes, genetic characteristics and other ecological factors, which can improve the prediction of viral evolvability for natural influenza virus strains [

 <xref rid="B108-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], and how to gather the current modeling factors to improve prediction of viral evolvability [
