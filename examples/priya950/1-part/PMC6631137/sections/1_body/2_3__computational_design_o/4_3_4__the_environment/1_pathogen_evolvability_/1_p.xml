<p>Uncovering the important ecological, immunological and environmental determinants on viral evolution is very important to make predictions of the viral emergence, fitness, transmissions and circulating potential after new substitution is introduced [

 <xref rid="B123-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. The zoonotic nature and complicated ecology of influenza viruses make evolvability more difficult to quantify and predict. But with the advances of phylogenetic algorithms, models can integrate and evaluate the impacts of environmental determinants. For example, an important development in phylogenetic modeling was the field of viral phylodynamics that was introduced in 2004 to study “how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape viral phylogenies” [

Dynamics of influenza virus infections and transmissions at individual-level (such as viral evolution within an infected host), population-level (individual hosts within a population), or ecology-level (entire populations of different host species) have been studied [
 <xref rid="B124-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Specially, phylodynamics have been used to study factors of interest on some viral phenotypes, including virulence, viral transmissibility, cell or tissue tropism, and antigenic phenotypes that can facilitate immune escape, etc. [
