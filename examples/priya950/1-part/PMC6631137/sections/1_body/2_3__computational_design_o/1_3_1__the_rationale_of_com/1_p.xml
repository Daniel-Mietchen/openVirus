<p>Traditional approaches have failed to produce stable and protective vaccines for hypervariable and rapidly-evolving viral pathogens, including influenza viruses [

 <xref rid="B31-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The reasons for this failure include inherent uncertainty in pathogen evolution [
 <xref rid="B32-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While global surveillance efforts and data sharing agreements have increased available information, vaccine design often ignores the underlying processes of the global influenza meta-population which generates diversity that allows the viral populations to escape vaccine-induced immune responses and anti-viral treatments. Furthermore, hemagglutination inhibition assay, central to vaccine strain selection, is a poor approximation for the average immune response that does not account for the heterogeneity of immune responses between hosts and pathogens, which cannot provide a full profile of pathogen immunogenic features [

 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], has resulted in major information gaps that can be addressed by existing computational approaches and a concerted effort to develop a unified framework. Individual immune response to a vaccine is an interplay of genetic, molecular and ecological factors from both host and pathogen populations on large tempo-spatial scales [
 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As a consequence, traditional design inefficiently captures few pathogen features based on a limited input that does not account for the high diversity of pathogen and high heterogeneity of hostâ€™s immune responses [
