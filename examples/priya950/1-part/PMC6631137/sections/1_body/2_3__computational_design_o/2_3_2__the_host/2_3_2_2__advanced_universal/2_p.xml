<p>FP-01.1 vaccine (also called as Flunisynâ„¢), comprises six different synthetic peptides (length: 35 amino acids) each conjugated to the fluorocarbon moiety C8F17(CH2)2-COOH. These epitopes were derived from the nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (M), and polymerase basic proteins (PB1 and PB2) and have high level conservancy across H1-H9 influenza A subtypes with wider population coverage. The phase I clinical trial [
