<p>Multimeric-001 (M-001), a universal influenza epitope-based vaccine, is currently at the pivotal phase III clinical trial to assess the safety and clinical efficacy as a standalone universal flu vaccine in participants with age of older than 50 for a two-year follow-up [

M-001 comprised with a single recombinant protein that contains nine linear, conserved and common epitopes from NP, M1, and HA of influenza A and B viruses to activate both humoral and cellular immune system to provide multi-strain protection from the seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B85-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The predicted population coverage of these selected epitopes is greater than 90%. The epitopes from the HA1 region which is hypervariable were not included in the M-001. At phase II clinical trial in 120 participants aged 65 years and older, M-001 was first administered to the study participants and three weeks later they were immunized with 2011-2012 seasonal trivalent inactivated vaccine. Results reported that M-001 alone elicited cellular responses and enhanced HA inhibition seroconversion to 2011/12 vaccine strains, and even to certain former vaccine strains [
