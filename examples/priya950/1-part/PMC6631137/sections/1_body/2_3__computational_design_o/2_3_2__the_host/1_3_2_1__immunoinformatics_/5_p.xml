<p>A major challenge in the design of epitope-based vaccines is to focus immune response onto multiple well-conserved epitopes in order to elicit broad protective/neutralizing immune responses. Epitope grafting or scaffolding, has been proposed as a solution for epitope-based vaccine design. In this method, minimal epitopes that are highly conserved in pathogen are grafted onto an appropriate heterologous-protein scaffold. Approaches for scaffold selection and design include single algorithm-based tools like MAMMOTH or meta-servers like TM-align and consensus-based designs [

Three main criteria have been proposed for the selection of scaffold that include size, where smaller-sized scaffolds help to focus immune responses to grafted epitopes while preventing unwanted responses to scaffold. Second criterion is the flexibility of scaffold with a possible positive correlation between flexibility and immunogenicity. The third criterion is the structural environment of the graft. A well-defined structural boundary between protein scaffold and epitopes enhances the specificity of immune responses [
