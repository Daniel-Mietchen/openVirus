<p>In this review, we aim to briefly summarize the currently applied approaches of seasonal and universal influenza vaccine design and their disadvantages (part 2), gather information on new or potential computational approaches and challenges (part 3), and to propose necessary resources and efforts needed for computational approaches of universal influenza vaccine candidates (part 4). We will explore the important role of computational vaccine design to improve the identification of pathogen antigens and key components for designing and evaluating a universal vaccine design. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential of incorporating interactions of virus-host-environment to develop models that allow for precise prediction for viral evolution and vaccine candidates. This review provides a framework to integrate computational advances that could help in restructuring the existing seasonal influenza vaccine design and contribute to the development of universal influenza vaccine.</p>
