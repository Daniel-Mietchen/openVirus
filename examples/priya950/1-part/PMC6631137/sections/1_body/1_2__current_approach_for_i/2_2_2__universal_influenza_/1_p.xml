<p>Seasonal vaccines offer a little or no protection to emerging zoonotic influenza viruses with pandemic potential, as many species, especially wild aquatic birds, are recognized as the natural reservoir of all subtypes of influenza A viruses and have the potential to occur spillover and infect humans directly [
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As with past pandemics, the surface glycoproteins, HA and neuraminidase (NA) are replaced through reassortments of zoonotic strains where the human population has no pre-existing immune protection and the vaccines in use are not cross-reactive with these new strains [

 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Experimentally-identified, conserved and immunogenic M2 protein antigens [
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and HA-stalk design [

 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] have the potential to elicit broadly protective antibodies against seasonal influenza strain. M2-based universal vaccine design focuses on the conserved antigens that have been experimentally identified on M2 protein. However, the low immunogenicity and epitope density by viral nature has been a fatal limit to make the cross-protection from M2 being effectively applied into vaccine design [
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To solve this issue, many approaches have been developed to improve M2 immunogenicity, details of which can be found in this review by Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similar with M2-based design, HA-stalk design tries to elicit the conserved and cross-reactive protection from the membrane-proximal stalk domain [
 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While the stalk domain is conserved across multiple influenza subtypes, it is shielded by the immune-dominant head domain. To amplify the broad protection from stalk domain, truncated HA without head domain, concentrated short peptides from stalk domain or recombinant chimeric HA proteins have been employed [

 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Despite the potential for both M2 and HA-stalk design vaccines to elicit broadly reactive immune response, a number of challenges remain (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and [
 <xref rid="B27-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), including a limited understanding of the full repertoire of potential epitopes. More systematic computational approaches that go beyond circulating strain prediction and incorporate a full profile of antigens stimulating both humoral and cellular immune responses are needed for universal vaccine design [
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To overcome these challenges, computational approaches have been employed to rationally design promising vaccine candidates that can induce broadly (ideally universally) cross-protective and durable immunity for all seasonal and even emerging pre-pandemic strains [
