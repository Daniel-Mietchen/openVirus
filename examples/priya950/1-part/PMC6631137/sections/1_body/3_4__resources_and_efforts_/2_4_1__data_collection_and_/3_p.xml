<p>The affiliated sequence meta-data records have been improved with samples from recent years; however, the epidemiological information, viral phenotypic characteristics and host characteristics are not sufficiently recorded. With no accurate information on geographical region, host species and migratory pathways and viral characteristics, we do lose lots of power in our model inference [
 <xref rid="B135-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>], not to say improving the prediction of viral evolvability. GISAID [

 <xref rid="B36-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], these open access database platforms have facilitated the accessibility and sharing of influenza sequence data to the science community. Despite the availability of these platforms, the sharing of viral sequence data is often long after the outbreaks and records are frequently incomplete [
 <xref rid="B136-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Therefore, a standardized protocol on how to record collected samples and what information is needed to report should be established for sharing more complete viral and host-related information.
