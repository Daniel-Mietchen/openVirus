<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00045-f002">Figure 2</xref>, computational models that fully integrate multiple sources of information, including experimental evidence, could aid in the identification of critical components for vaccine design. However, we cannot solely rely on computational design, where computed antigens have uncertain biological effects. Experimental evidence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00045-f001">Figure 1</xref>) from animal models or approved human clinical trials are valuable to be incorporated into computational design. The experimental data on pathogen immunogenicity and host immune system can first provide preliminary evidence on natural or computed antigens and further amplify the usage of this new evidence to the computational procedure for more accurate prediction and evaluation [
