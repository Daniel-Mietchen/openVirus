<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science, which usually uses statistical techniques and mathematical models to make computers “learn” with data without being explicitly programmed, that is, performance on a specific task progressively improves [
 <xref rid="B141-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Machine learning algorithms discover patterns in data and construct mathematical models using these prior discoveries. One advantage of machine learning is that the models can be used to make predictions on future data by cumulating from previous evidence and improving on forecasting algorithms [

 <xref rid="B144-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Though still in an early phase of implementation, the concept of machine learning has been used in viral evolutionary modeling and has been a rapid way to gather and update information based on known information [

 <xref rid="B146-vaccines-07-00045" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Machine learning can incorporate different modeling steps and all available surveillance, genetic and experimental data to keep updating information and make predictions for computational vaccine design (

For example, the model of conserved epitope prediction mentioned in previous sections can also be incorporated into the platform with host and environmental factors to make prediction on currently circulating viruses, where broad-reactive vaccine candidates can be rapidly computed and tested.
