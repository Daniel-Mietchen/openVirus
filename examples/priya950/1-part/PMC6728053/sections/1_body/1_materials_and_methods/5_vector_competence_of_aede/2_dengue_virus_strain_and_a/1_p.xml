<p>The DENV-2 strain used in this study (Sample number: 008/01/2012) was isolated during the 2012 outbreak in Mandera, Kenya. The virus had been passaged twice on C6/36 cells and twice on Vero E6 cells grown in cell culture media consisting of Minimum Essential Media-MEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), with Earle's salts and reduced NaHCO3, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich), 2% L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2% antibiotic/antimycotic solution with 10,000 units penicillin, 10 mg streptomycin and 25μg amphotericin B per ml (Sigma- Aldrich) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007686.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This virus stock, with a titer of 10
 <sup>4.3</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml, was kept frozen at -80°C. To produce infectious virus for the vector competence study, a vial of this stock virus was used to inoculate freshly grown Vero E6 cells in a T-25 cell culture flask (Corning Incorporated, USA). Virus adsorption was achieved by incubating the cells at 37°C for 1 hour. The cells were overlaid with maintenance media (MEM supplemented with 2% FBS), and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Cells were observed daily for peak viral levels and harvested by day 7, after observing 80% cythopathic effect (CPE). The DENV-2 media suspension was harvested for direct use, without freezing, in the mosquito infectious blood meal trials.
