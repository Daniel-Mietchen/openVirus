<p>We tested

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from Mombasa, Kisumu, and Nairobi for their susceptibility to DENV-2. These mosquitoes were collected as immatures from water holding containers in and around houses between October-December 2016. Immature mosquitoes were reared to F
 <sub>0</sub> adults in a BSL-2 insectary at 
 <italic>icipe</italic>, maintained at 28Â°C and a 12:12 (L:D) photoperiod [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007686.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. After the identity of the adult mosquitoes was confirmed as 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, they were blood-fed on laboratory mice (Kenya Medical Research Institute, Animal house) to provide eggs. The eggs were hatched in dechlorinated tap water, and the emerging larvae were fed once a day on Tetramin fish food (Tetra, USA). To obtain F
 <sub>2</sub> mosquitoes, the same procedure was repeated for the emerging F
 <sub>1</sub> adults. The F
 <sub>2</sub> mosquito generation was used in the vector competence study for all three cities.
