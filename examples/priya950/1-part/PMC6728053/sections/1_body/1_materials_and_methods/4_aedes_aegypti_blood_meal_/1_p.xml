<p>In addition to mosquito collection conducted using the BG-Sentinel traps, we also attempted to collect blood-fed mosquitoes using a prokopack aspirator indoors, outdoors, and on the nearby vegetation from 150 houses per city (50 per season). As no blood-fed

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes collected using BG-Sentinel traps, only. The abdomen of individual mosquitoes was cut using a scalpel, sterilized with 70% ethanol between specimens to prevent cross contamination of samples. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood contained in individual mosquito abdomens using the DNeasy blood and tissue Kit (Qiagen, GmbH-Hilden, Germany) as per the manufacturerâ€™s recommendation. The extracted DNA was used as a template for amplification of a 500 bp fragment of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene (

Unidirectional sequencing (forward strand) was outsourced to a commercial company (Inqaba biotec, Pretoria, South Africa). Sequences were evaluated through BLAST nucleotide searches against the Genbank database (
