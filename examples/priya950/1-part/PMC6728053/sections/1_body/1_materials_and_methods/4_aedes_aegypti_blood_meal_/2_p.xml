<p>To increase the sample size of blood fed mosquitoes, an additional sampling was done using the BG-Sentinel traps for 7 consecutive days (12 traps per day) during the long-rain season (April-June) in 2018, for the three cities. These mosquitoes, which were used for host blood meal determination alone, were processed for blood meal identification in the same manner as the blood-fed mosquitoes collected during 2014â€“2016.</p>
