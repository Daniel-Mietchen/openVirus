<p>Scientific and ethical approval was obtained from Kenya Medical Research Institute Scientific and Ethics Review Unit (KEMRI-SERU) (Project Number SERU 2787). We sought permission from household heads through oral informed consent to allow their residences to be surveyed for mosquitoes. The animal use component was reviewed and approved by the KEMRI Animal care and use committee (KEMRI ACUC) (approval number KEMRI/ACUC/ 03.03.14) through the KEMRI-SERU review process. The KEMRI ACUC ensures adherence to national guidelines on the care and use of animals in research and education in Kenya enforced by National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation (NACOSTI). The Institute has a foreign assurance identification number F16-00211 (A5879-01) from the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare under the Public Health Service and commits to the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals.</p>
