<p>Overall, the DENV-2 transmission rates were generally low in all three populations. This may be explained by the fact that we used the capillary tube method to estimate DENV-2 transmission. Methods collecting mosquito saliva may underestimate virus transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007686.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, there are currently no suitable animal models to estimate DENV transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007686.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Because the methods of virus exposure and transmission determination were the same for all three mosquito populations, our transmission rate estimates would not be significantly affected should transmission rates increase under field conditions. As a limitation, our study only focused on DENV-2, one of the most prevalent serotype, and further studies on the other DENV serotypes (DENV-1 and -3) circulating in Kenya [
