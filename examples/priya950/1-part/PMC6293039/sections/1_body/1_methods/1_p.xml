<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma samples were collected from the patient 2 weeks after onset of symptoms at the Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, and stored at −80°C. Viral metagenomic sequencing was performed on the CSF and plasma samples. Viral sequences were extended by genome walking, and the resulting contigs were used to infer an amino acid phylogeny and identity matrix. A reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was developed, and the virus was quantified in CSF and plasma. Inflammatory biomarkers were measured in CSF and plasma using a Luminex panel. Details of the assays are provided in the
