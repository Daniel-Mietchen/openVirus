<p>For CSF, an insufficient availability of sample material of reference cases restricted similar comparisons of biomarker profiles, as described above for plasma. Therefore, the individual inflammatory biomarker concentrations were compared to reference ranges (

 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Elevated inflammatory biomarker concentrations were found for interleukin (IL) 4, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, monokine induced by γ-interferon, and tumor necrosis factor α. These concentrations are in line with what is generally seen in viral encephalitis, and make another cause (eg, an auto-immune cause) highly unlikely [
