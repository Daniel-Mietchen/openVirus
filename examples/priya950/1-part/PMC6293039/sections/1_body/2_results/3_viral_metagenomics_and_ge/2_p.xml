<p>To acquire additional sequence information and also confirm that no other viral infection occurred in this patient, 2 Illumina MiSeq libraries were subsequently prepared on separate CSF and plasma samples. Among the total of 4.5 million reads, no known virus was found, yet several sequences of the M and S segments of the novel virus were found. Consequently, sequence information from all 3 orthobunyavirus segments was obtained. All showed large genetic variations to their closest relative, the Tataguine virus (
