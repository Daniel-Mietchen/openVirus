<p>To test for an unexpected or unknown virus, a viral metagenomics assay was performed on CSF and plasma, which initially generated 6,947 sequence reads. No known viruses were identified, yet 2 sequence reads (partially overlapping) showed some, although low, amino acid identities (the percentage of matching amino acids) to several orthobunyavirus L-segments. Using genome walking, the L-segment sequence was extended to 936 nucleotides. A PCR developed to target this sequence confirmed the presence of this sequence in both CSF and plasma of the patient.</p>
