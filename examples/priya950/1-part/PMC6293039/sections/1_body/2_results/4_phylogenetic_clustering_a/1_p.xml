<p>To determine the phylogenetic clustering of Ntwetwe virus with known orthobunyaviruses, reference sequences from related serogroups were used (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). For all segments, Ntwetwe virus clustered within the Anopheles-Tataguine clade (containing the Anopheles A and B serogroups and unclassified Tataguine virus) and related most closely to Tataguine virus. Phylogenetic analysis was also done on the nucleotide level, and yielded similar clustering. The amino acid identity to the closest relative for the S-segment was 59% (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Table 2</xref> for a complete S-segment amino acid identity matrix).
