<p>The clinical presentation and host response of the blood and CNS comparments of the described patient were highly suggestive of a viral encephalitis. The decorticate posturing and autonomic dysregulation were likely suggestive of a severe brain impairment that may have been caused by brainstem herniation or cerebral haemorrhaging, which both are known to occur during severe forms of encephalitis [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Alternatively, direct neuronal damage by the infection or immunopathology may have contributed to the severe encephalopathy. Because Ntwetwe virus was the only virus identified in this patient, a viral encephalitis, elicited by the Ntwetwe virus was the most likely cause of disease.
