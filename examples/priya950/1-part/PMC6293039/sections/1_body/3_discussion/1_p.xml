<p>Ntwetwe virus is a novel orthobunyavirus identified in the CSF of a Ugandan child with a suspected CNS infection for which, despite extensive conventional investigations, no known pathogen could be identified. Partial sequence information from all (S, M, and L) Ntwetwe virus segments was obtained, and showed considerable genetic distance to currently known viruses. According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the amino acid sequences of the nucleocapsid proteins differ by more than 10% for distinct orhobunyavirus species [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The Ntwetwe virus nucleocapsid protein, coded for by the S-segment, showed a 41% protein distance to its closes relative, Tataguine virus.
