<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, children often present to hospitals with fever and acute alterations of consciousness, yet causes remain unidentified in up to 75% of such cases [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recent insights have indicated that central nervous system (CNS) infections of viral origin are more prevalent than previously thought, and novel viruses may explain some of these unexplained CNS infections [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Uganda is considered a hotspot for zoonotic and vector-borne pathogens, where such novel viruses may emerge [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2016, a Ugandan girl presented to the hospital with a suspected CNS infection for which no pathogen could be identified using conventional diagnostics. Viral metagenomic sequencing was performed to find the causative agent and a novel orthobunyavirus was identified. Orthobunyaviruses are negative-sense RNA viruses consisting of 3 segments: large (L), medium (M), and small (S). They are commonly found in Uganda, are often zoonotic and vector-borne, and are known to cause human CNS infections [
