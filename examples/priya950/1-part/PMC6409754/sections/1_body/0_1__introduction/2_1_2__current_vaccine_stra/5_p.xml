<p>Currently, two IAV subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and two influenza B virus (IBV) lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) are co-circulating in humans and they are responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics. The first LAIV (FluMist; MedImmune) that was approved for use in the US was a trivalent vaccine that contained antigens from both IAV H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes and one IBV lineage (either Victoria or Yamagata) [

In 2012, the FDA approved a quadrivalent vaccine formulation containing both IBV Yamagata and Victoria components, in order to provide protection against the two IBV lineages as well as the two IAV subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) circulating in humans [

In the quadrivalent LAIV (Flumist), two cold-adapted MDVs, A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2, and B/Ann Arbor/1/66, are used as backbone to generate four 6 + 2 reassortant viruses with the external HA and NA glycoproteins from the circulating IAVs (H1N1 and H3N2) and IBVs (Victoria and Yamagata lineages), respectively [
