<p>Three types of vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the human population: recombinant viral HAs, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIVs), and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The IIV, which was introduced and licensed in the 1940s, is the most common vaccine for the treatment of influenza virus infections. IIVs are produced by co-infection of embryonated chicken eggs with the strain annually recommended by the WHO (WHO candidate) and a high-growth virus, such as A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) (

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. At 2–3 days post-infection, the desired 6:2 reassortant virus, containing the HA and NA viral segments from the WHO recommended the circulating strain and the backbone of the high-grow virus, is selected by amplification in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the HA and NA of the high-growth virus (
