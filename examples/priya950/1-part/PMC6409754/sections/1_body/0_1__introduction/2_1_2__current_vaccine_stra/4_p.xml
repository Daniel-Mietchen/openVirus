<p>In contrast to IIVs, LAIVs are intranasally administrated and they mimic the natural route of influenza infection. They induce broader and more robust immune responses that resemble those induced during natural viral infection, including cellular and humoral responses in the mucosal [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Importantly, LAIVs can prime a specific T cell-mediated immune response in naive populations and provide cross-protection against heterosubtypic strains, including pandemic influenza viruses. This LAIV protection profile is a highly desirable requisite for effective influenza vaccine candidates [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The strategy to produce LAIVs is based on the co-infection of chicken embryonated eggs with the WHO candidate and a Master Donor Virus (MDV) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The segmented nature of the influenza virus genome allows for the generation of a reassortant virus containing the HA and NA of the selected WHO candidate and the six remaining internal segments from the MDV. The 6:2 reassortant virus is selected by passaging in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the surface glycoproteins of the MDV strain and at low temperature (25 °C) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The MDV that is used in the US to produce LAIVs for IAV is the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], which was generated after serial passages under gradually low temperatures of the parental A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 virus in primary chicken kidney (PCK) cells [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This process ensures that the selected MDV has a cold adapted (ca), temperature sensitive (ts) and attenuated (att) phenotype, which has been shown to be conferred by four mutations in two of the viral polymerase components PB2 (N265S) and PB1 (K391E, D581G, and A661T) and one in the viral NP (D34G) [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. As a result, the MDV displays limited replication at high (37 °C or 39 °C) temperatures, but it has efficient replication at lower (25 °C to 33 °C) temperatures [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This temperature restriction allows for the LAIV to efficiently replicate in the colder human upper respiratory tract, while avoiding viral replication in the warmer lower respiratory tract, where influenza virus infection causes diseases [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Due to the fact that the ca, ts, and att phenotype of the LAIV is conferred by five mutations in three different viral segments (PB2, PB1, and NP), it is not likely to revert to a virulent form, providing the LAIV with a high safety profile [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In any case, each strain that is incorporated into a LAIV is tested to ensure that the ca, ts, and att phenotype has been retained and clinically evaluated to assess its safety before final release for widespread use [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In addition, sublingual administration of the LAIV has been evaluated and compared to intranasal administration [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Intranasal administration of the LAIV could lead to virus invasion of olfactory bulbs, representing an important safety concern [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, sublingual administration could overcome this risk while also being equally effective in the protection against lethal viral infection [
