<p>When new viruses are introduced in the human population IAVs can also cause occasional pandemics of great consequences [

The World Health Organization (WHO) has the main role in surveillance across the world by using data obtained from more than 130 national influenza centers that are located in over 100 countries to identify the antigenicity and sequence of current circulating viruses and perform the correct update of the vaccine for the following influenza season [
