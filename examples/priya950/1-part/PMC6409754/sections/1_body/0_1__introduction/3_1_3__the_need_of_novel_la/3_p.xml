<p>Although the reason(s) of the reduced effectiveness of the LAIV has not been fully understood and multiple variables could be responsible for its low efficiency, the LAIV has several advantages over the IIV for the control of influenza viral infections. These include, among others, the intranasal route of administration of LAIV over the intramuscular administration of the IIV [

 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. For developing countries where a limited number of health care workers are available to administrate the vaccine in a short period of time, LAIVs are especially attractive because of the use of a single-dose and needle-free delivery system [

 <xref rid="B100-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. A recent phase IV clinical trial has also evaluated the feasibility of Flumist LAIV self-administration and demonstrates equally safe and immunogenic profile than when health care workers administer the LAIV [
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Therefore, new approaches are still urgently needed to develop and guarantee the ideal LAIV profile, which includes safety, efficacy, stability, ease of administration, and production for the treatment of seasonal and potential pandemic influenza viral infections in humans.
