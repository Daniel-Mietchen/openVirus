<p>In the past decades, influenza vaccine preparation has evolved to ensure effective protection against seasonal viral infections, while maintaining a good safety profile [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The degree of protection after vaccination is known to be dependent on the antigenic match between the vaccine strains and those that are circulating in the community, the age of the vaccine recipient, and the previous history of viral infection and/or vaccination [

 <xref rid="B75-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The continuous mutations that IAV undergoes in the viral HA and NA proteins directly affect the Antigenic match, which affects the recognition by vaccine-induced antibodies or by any preexisting immunity [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Vaccine effectiveness is annually evaluated mainly using data routinely acquired from individuals with influenza-like illness as an estimated percentage effectiveness adjusted for age, timing, and geography [

 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Historically, the LAIV has been shown to provide greater efficacy than the IIV in children, with absolute LAIV efficacy rates of 75–80% [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. However, different studies revealed low effectiveness among children of the quadrivalent LAIV during the 2013–2014 (18%), 2014–2015 (28%), and 2015–2016 (48%) seasons [

 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Based on this low effectiveness, the ACIP concluded that a preference for the quadrivalent LAIV over the IIV was no longer warranted and then recommended that the quadrivalent LAIV should not be used during the subsequent 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 influenza seasons [

 <xref rid="B86-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. However, for the 2018–2019 influenza season, the use of the LAIV has again been a recommended option, but with no preference over the IIV [
