<p>Several plasmid-based reverse genetics approaches have been developed to generate recombinant influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Currently, the most common method delivers eight ambisense and bidirectional plasmids for the simultaneous expression of the positive-stranded viral mRNAs and the negative-stranded vRNA in susceptible cells (

 <xref rid="B104-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. This reverse genetics system is based on a dual promoter concept in which a complementary (c)DNA copy of the vRNA is cloned in an ambisense plasmid carrying a RNA polymerase I (Pol I) promoter to direct the synthesis of vRNAs; and, in the opposite orientation, a RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter driving mRNA expression from the same cDNA (

 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The eight-ambisense plasmids are then co-transfected into FDA-approved cells and 3â€“4 days after transfection, viable virus can be recovered from the tissue culture supernatant of transfected cells and then amplified in either fresh FDA-approved cells or chicken embryonic eggs (

 <xref rid="B117-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Currently, the generation of recombinant viruses for the development of influenza vaccines for human use in the US and Europe is limited to a selected number of mammalian cells, such as MDCK or Vero cells [
