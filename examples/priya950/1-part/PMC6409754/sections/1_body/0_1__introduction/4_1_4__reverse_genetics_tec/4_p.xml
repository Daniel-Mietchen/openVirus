<p>Importantly, due to biosafety concerns and the inherent high lethality in chicken embryos, the classical approach of generating vaccine candidates cannot be used to produce vaccines for highly pathogenic IAV (HPAIV), such H5N1 [

Reverse genetic approaches represent an excellent alternative to the traditional method for influenza vaccine production and it might become the method of choice for developing candidate vaccine in global efforts that are directed towards pandemic preparedness [
