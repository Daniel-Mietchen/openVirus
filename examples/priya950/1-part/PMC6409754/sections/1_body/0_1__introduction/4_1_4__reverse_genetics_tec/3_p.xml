<p>Although the FDA approved the cell-based production method of influenza vaccines in 2012, the global-scale infrastructure for manufacturing the required amount of cell-based influenza vaccines does not currently exist [

 <xref rid="B124-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. One of the reasons why the traditional method for influenza vaccine production by co-infection of using chicken embryonated eggs (
