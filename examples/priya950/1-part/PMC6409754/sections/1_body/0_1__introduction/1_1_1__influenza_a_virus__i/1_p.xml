<p>IAV belongs to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family of enveloped negative sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with a segmented genome [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f001">Figure 1</xref>). IAVs are classified based on the antigenic properties of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) viral surface glycoproteins into 18 HA (H1 to H18) and 11 NA (N1 to N11) subtypes [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Both the HA and NA glycoproteins are the most abundant proteins in the viral envelope, followed by the matrix 2 (M2) protein (

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Under the viral membrane, the inner surface envelope matrix 1 (M1) protein encloses the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. These vRNPs present the core of the virion and consist of the viral (v)RNA segments that are coated with viral nucleoprotein (NP), and one single copy of the viral heterotrimeric polymerase complex that is made up of the polymerase acidic (PA) and basic 1 and 2 (PB1, PB2) proteins [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The eight vRNA segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS) contain long central coding regions that are flanked at both termini by non-coding regions (NCRs) that are critical for vRNA genome replication and gene transcription (

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the most external 3′ and 5′ ends of each vRNA segment, packaging signals are located and needed for virus assembly [
