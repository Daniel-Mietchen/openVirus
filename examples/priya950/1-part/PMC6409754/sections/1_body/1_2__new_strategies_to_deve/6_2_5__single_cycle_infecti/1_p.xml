<p>SciIAVs can be generated by the mutation, deletion, or substitution of viral components using molecular biology techniques. These viruses can be defective in viral genome synthesis, assembly, or release of viral particles, and thus lack the ability to spread after initial infection [

 <xref rid="B192-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. In non-complementing cells lines, primary infection occurs, but no infectious viral progeny will be produced. For in vivo studies, animals expressing complementing proteins in tissues could be used to allow for infection and progeny production of sciIAVs. In this way, transgenic mice infected with a sciIAV could show pathogenesis but they should not be able to transmit infection to WT mice [
