<p>The potential of a sciIAV ΔNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f009">Figure 9</xref>D) as an LAIV was firstly evaluated by Shinya et al. [
 <xref rid="B210-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. They generated a sciIAV ΔNA in the backbone of WSN by inserting the ORF of GFP between the first 183 (3’ end) and the last 157 (5’ end) nucleotides of the NA vRNA. This virus was attenuated in parental cell cultures, yet it grew efficiently in cell lines expressing reduced levels of sialic acids. The GFP-expressing sciIAV ΔNA was attenuated in mice and it could induce complete protection against a lethal dose of WT WSN. Since the deletion of NA could allow the insertion of a gene encoding a protein antigen from another pathogen, Masic et al. generated a swine influenza virus (SIV) by fusing the H3 HA ectodomain from A/Swine/Texas/4199-2/98 H3N2 to the cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, and stalk region of NA from A/Swine/Saskatchewan/18789/02 H1N1 SIV [
