<p>A PR8 sciIAV ΔPB2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f009">Figure 9</xref>A) expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) between the NCR and coding 120 nucleotides at both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the PB2 gene was used as vaccine candidate by Victor et al. [
 <xref rid="B201-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. This vaccine was shown to be safe in mice and it elicited antibodies against viral proteins as well as GFP, suggesting that the sciIAV ΔPB2 might serve as a LAIV and also as a vaccine vector to deliver antigens from other pathogens in order to develop bivalent vaccines. Although the authors did not find an improvement in protection efficacy of PR8 sciIAVΔPB2 as compared to inactivated WT PR8, they proved that this sciIAV represents a reliable, safe, and efficacious LAIV candidate. Uraki et al. generated a bivalent vaccine by using the PR8 sciIAV ΔPB2 backbone as viral vector and by replacing PB2 with a heterologous IAV HA from either pH1N1 or A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 [

The resultant viruses were immunogenic and protected mice from lethal challenge with PR8, and also the IAV from which the foreign HA originated. Similar results were obtained by other authors who replaced the PB2 vRNA by antigens from different pathogens, such as human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) [
 <xref rid="B203-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>] or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [
 <xref rid="B204-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>], suggesting that this platform can be used to develop both monovalent and/or bivalent vaccines against influenza strains or different respiratory pathogens.
