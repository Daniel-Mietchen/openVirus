<p>Mutations in the HA cleavage site have also been used as an approach to develop sciIAVs as LAIV candidates [
 <xref rid="B208-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. Katsura et al. engineered a reassortment between pH1N1 and PR8 viruses using the HA and NA from pH1N1 and the remaining six segments from PR8. The arginine (R) at the cleavage site of HA1 (position 325), which is critical for HA cleavage by trypsin-like protease, was changed to threonine (T). Since this HA could not be processed into HA1-HA2, which is essential for membrane fusion, the virus was unable to complete its replication cycle. Thus, the MDCK cells that constitutively expressed HA from pH1N1 were used to propagate the virus (

 <sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were more efficiently induced than in mice immunized with the formalin-inactivated IIV. Moreover, mice that were immunized with the uncleavable HA sciIAV survived the lethal WT pH1N1 challenge, while mice immunized with IIV did not.
