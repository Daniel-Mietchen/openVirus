 <bold>b</bold>) SciIAV based on mutations of a viral component: The mutation of certain viral components that results in a loss of functionality, expression, or processing is other strategy that is used to develop sciIAVs, without needing to delete or substitute a complete viral gene [

Powell et al. modified the HA sequence that was derived from a PR8 strain (Cambridge) that is particularly virulent for mice by replacing the original ATG start codon with a TAG stop codon to suppress the translation of the signal sequence [
 <xref rid="B207-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. In addition, they removed a single nucleotide at the end of the signal sequence to ensure that, if the original ATG was reconstituted from the mutated TAG stop codon, then the sequence would read out of frame. Finally, as a further safety, the HA cleavage site was also inactivated [
