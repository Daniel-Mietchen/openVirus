<p>During the last few decades, considerable improvements have been accomplished in the development of LAIVs. However, vaccine manufacturing is still a slow process that allows for the emergence of mutations of the selected IAV while the vaccine is being manufactured, leading to less effectiveness than expected [

In the past few years, numerous strategies for the generation of LAIV candidates have been developed using reverse techniques approaches by different research groups. Many of the strategies have provided promising candidates that could be tested and implemented as LAIVs in the near future, and we will discuss the most promising in this review.
