<p>More recently, Harding et al. generated a PR8 virus containing two HAs (H1 and H3) [
 <xref rid="B187-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. The authors modified segment 4 (HA) of WT PR8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f007">Figure 7</xref>C) to encode PR8 NA, followed by a furin cleavage site and the porcine teschovirus 1 (PTV1) 2A cleavage site, allowing for co-linear expression but individual translation of both viral proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f007">Figure 7</xref>D). Likewise, segment 6, where NA is encoded (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f007">Figure 7</xref>C), was modified to encode a different viral HA from an H3 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f007">Figure 7</xref>D). First, they assayed the ability of this technology to allow for the incorporation of both H1 and H3 subtypes in the same virion by using the HA from A/Hong Kong/1968 H3N2. Importantly, dual-HA H1/H3 virions packaged similar levels of both the H1 and H3 glycoproteins as the single HA parent PR8 virus. However, a delay was observed in the growth kinetics profile of the dual-HA when compared to the WT PR8, suggesting that the increased genome size could lead to viral attenuation. This dual-HA H1/H3 virus was attenuated in mice and it elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies that were able to neutralize virus at similar levels as those elicited from the parental PR8 infection. Vaccination with the inactivated dual-HA virus fully protected mice from challenge that are associated with either PR8 or X31, demonstrating that those antibodies generated after dual-HA H1/H3 virus vaccination were protective.
