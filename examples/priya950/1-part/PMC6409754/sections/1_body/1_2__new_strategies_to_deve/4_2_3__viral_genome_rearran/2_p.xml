<p>The genome rearrangement strategy has been used for developing LAIVs against H9N2 and H5N1 HPAIV, which carry pandemic potential [

 <xref rid="B185-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. To that end, A/Guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/1999 H9N2 was modified to express a second HA from A/Vietnam/120320/04 H5N1 [
 <xref rid="B186-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. The authors employed the viral NS segment for the stable expression of H9N2 NS1 and H5N1 HA protein, which were separated using the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A autocleavage site, allowing for individual expression of both viral proteins (

When the H9N2-H5 virus was administrated as a LAIV into mice and ferrets, it provided protection against a lethal challenge with A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 and a pH1N1 reassortant virus expressing H9 [
