<p>IAVs carrying rearranged genomes have shown to serve as LAIV candidates offering several advantages over other LAIV approaches: (i) because of the reorganization of the genome, it is unlikely, if not impossible, for the virus to revert to WT; (ii) foreign genes could be expressed by altering the viral genome organization without altering protein expression; (iii) the reorganization of the viral genome does not affect the antigenicity of viral proteins; and, (iv) rearranged viruses expressing additional HA and/or NA could be used as bivalent LAIVs to protect against multiple strains.</p>
