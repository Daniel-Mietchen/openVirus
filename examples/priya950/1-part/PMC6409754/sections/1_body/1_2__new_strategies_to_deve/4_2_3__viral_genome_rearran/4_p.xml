<p>Although the overall aim of the authors in this study was to develop a platform to allow for the efficient growth of influenza H3 subtypes in eggs, the authors also generated viruses carrying HA segments from currently circulating IAV vaccine strains (H1N1 and H3N2), as well as IBV from Victoria and Yamagata lineages. They observed robust growth for all of the recombinant viruses, indicating that there was no functional interference between the two HA proteins, with no emerging mutations being observed after several rounds of growth in eggs. Finally, they evaluated the antigenic stability of an H3 protein that is normally unstable during growth in embryonated chicken eggs (A/Fujian/411/2002 H3N2) [
 <xref rid="B188-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. The coexistence of this H3 protein with H1 PR8 in the virion lead to an increase (~4 orders of magnitude) in growth titer in embryonated chicken eggs as compared to the standard 6:2 reassortant in the PR8 background with the glycoproteins of A/Fujian/411/2002 H3N2. In addition, no mutations in HA were observed after passaging in eggs, suggesting that this approach allows for antigenically stable growth of essentially any clinically relevant IAV strain. Overall, the authors showed that this rearrangement technology is compatible with current vaccine production practices and it can be used to allow the rapid production of more effective LAIVs. However, further studies should be performed to assess not only the stability and immunogenicity, but also the dual protection efficacy of all vaccine candidates for their safe implementation as immunogenic and protective influenza vaccines.
