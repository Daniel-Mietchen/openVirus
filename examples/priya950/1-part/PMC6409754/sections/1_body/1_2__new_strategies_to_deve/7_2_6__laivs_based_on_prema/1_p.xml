<p>Live but replication-incompetent IAV vaccines have recently been generated that are based on the generation of a premature termination codon (PTC) [
 <xref rid="B222-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. Normally, the ribosome translates genome sequences into a polypeptide by complementing triplet-codons with matching aminoacylated tRNAs. The triplet UAG (amber codon) does not code for an amino acid and it is usually a translation termination signal or stop codon, resulting in the termination of the synthesis of the nascent polypeptide. However, in certain species, the amber codon corresponds to a tRNA anticodon (tRNA
 <sup>CUA</sup>), which is able to introduce an unnatural amino acid (UAA) at a stop codon. These UAG-tRNAs have been successfully used in research to introduce UAAs into proteins. In this case, a complementary amber tRNA
 <sup>CUA</sup> is aminoacylated by an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that is designed to only accept UAAs [
 <xref rid="B223-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. Longlong Si et al. generated a LAIV using a transgenic human embryonic kidney 293T cell line that contained the orthogonal translation machinery [
 <xref rid="B222-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. Transgenic cells contained integrated cassettes for the expression of the 
 <italic>Methanosarcina barkeri</italic> MS pyrrolysyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA
 <sup>CUA</sup> pair (pylRS/tRNA
 <sub>CUA</sub>), the orthogonal UAA N
 <sup>Îµ</sup>-2-azidoethyloxycarbonylL-lysine, and a gene encoding an amber codon-containing GFP (GFP
 <sup>39TAG</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f010">Figure 10</xref>). GFP expression in the presence of UAAs was used to select genetically stable cells lines after 200 passages. The ability of the resultant transgenic cells (HEK293T-tRNA/pylRS/ GFP
 <sup>39TAG</sup>) to propagate a WT WSN virus was tested in parallel with parental HEK293T cells. Subsequently, different PTC viruses were generated, harboring amber codons in different viral segments, although a PTC virus harboring four stop codons in PA, PB2, PB1, and NP (PTC-4;) segments was used, since it maintained the intact surface antigens HA and NA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f010">Figure 10</xref>A). All of the PTC viruses were generated in transgenic cells expressing pylRS/tRNA
 <sub>CUA</sub>, which were able to introduce UAA at each stop codon position (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f010">Figure 10</xref>B). The generation and stepwise production of PTC viruses were only possible in the transgenic cells in the presence of UAAs and not in the parental HEK293T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f010">Figure 10</xref>C), suggesting a high level of safety for this technology as LAIV. The safety of PTC-4 virus was evaluated by intranasally infecting mice, ferrets, and guinea pigs. The results that were obtained from the three animal models indicated that PTC-4 virus was attenuated and reversion did not occur in vivo. Moreover, the PTC-4 virus induced a robust mucosal, humoral, and cell-mediated immunity that conferred protection against homologous WT challenge in the three animal models [
 <xref rid="B222-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. In addition, PTC-4 protected mice from a challenge with heterologous IAVs. Together, these results confirm that replication-incompetent viruses based on PTC technology can potentially be implemented as LAIV to confer protection against both homosubtypic and heterosubtypic IAV strains. Due to the simplicity of the technique, it can be adapted to almost any virus with a genome that can be manipulated and packaged in a cell line.
