<p>Both the IAV M and NS segments encode two polypeptides using an alternative splicing mechanism: M1 and M2; and, NS1 and NEP, respectively (

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Three reorganized PR8 viruses were constructed by Nogales et al. by splitting the overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) of the M1 and M2 (M split; Ms) (

When evaluating growth kinetics properties in MDCK cells at 33 °C, 37 °C, and 39 °C, the authors found that the NS virus grew at slightly lower titers than WT PR8. However, viruses containing the modified M segment (Ms and Ms/Ns) were severely impaired in replication at 37 °C and 39 °C, whereas high viral titers could be reached at 33 °C, suggesting that the M split segment was responsible for the ts phenotype. Importantly, PR8 viruses that contained the M split segment (Ms and Ms/Ns) were highly attenuated in vivo and they protected mice from a lethal homologous challenge with WT PR8 [

Notably, the LAIV candidates that were based on the reorganized M segment (Ms and Ms/Ns) were both more effective in inducing immunity and protecting mice against a lethal homologous challenge with PR8 WT than a PR8 LAIV containing the ts, ca, and att mutations (PB2 N265S; PB1 K391E, D581G, and A661T; NP D34G) of the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 used in the human LAIV [

 <xref rid="B189-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. These results showed that the rearrangement of the IAV M segment alone or in combination with the NS segment could be used as a feasible alternative for the generation of safe, immunogenic, and protective LAIV for the treatment of IAV infections.
