<p>More recently, a similar approach was used by Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B174-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>] and Broadbent et al. [
 <xref rid="B177-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>] to generate recombinant PR8 and A/California/7/2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) viruses, respectively, where the codon pairs in HA (PR8-HA
 <sup>Min</sup>), NA (PR8-NA
 <sup>Min</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B174-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>], or HA and NA (PR8 or pH1N1-HA/NA
 <sup>Min</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B174-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>,
 <xref rid="B177-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>] were deoptimized (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f006">Figure 6</xref>D, bottom). In both studies, all of the variants (PR8 and pH1N1) were efficiently replicated in MDCK cells, although a reduction in HA and/or NA protein expression was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f006">Figure 6</xref>D, bottom). PR8-HA/NA
 <sup>Min</sup> was evaluated in mice and it displayed severe attenuation while protecting against homologous PR8 and heterologous (A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2 or A/Victoria/3/75 H3N2) viral challenges, which is likely due to the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses [
 <xref rid="B174-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Likewise, attenuation, immunogenicity, and protection efficacy of pH1N1-HA/NA
 <sup>Min</sup> were evaluated in ferrets [
 <xref rid="B177-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. Although this virus was attenuated, it was able to induce a humoral immune response that protected against homologous challenge. In summary, both of the authors demonstrated that, although the expression of HA and NA glycoproteins is reduced by deoptimization of codon pairs, modified viruses are still immunogenic and able to induce a protective immune response. Likely, a combination or individual use of either strategy—codon usage and codon-pair bias—might be considered to be a feasible approach for the development of safe, immunogenic, and protective LAIV in the future.
