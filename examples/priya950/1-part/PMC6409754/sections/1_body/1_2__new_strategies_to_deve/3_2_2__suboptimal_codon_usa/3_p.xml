<p>IAVs circulating in different hosts have been found to have distinct codon usage patterns, which may reflect host adaptation [
 <xref rid="B168-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Fan et al. have described that it is feasible to generate a human seasonal IAV that is specifically attenuated in human cells, but not in eggs, by converting its codon usage to that present in avian IAVs [
 <xref rid="B176-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. In this work, the authors introduced over 300 mutations into the genome of the seasonal A/Brisbane/59/2007 H1N1 [
 <xref rid="B176-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. Corroborating the hypothesis of the authors, the resultant virus was attenuated in mammal cells and mice, being important for its safe implementation as an LAIV, while displaying efficient growth in eggs, which is important for vaccine production. Remarkably, in mice, this virus elicited a strong immune response and conferred protection against both homologous and heterologous IAV challenges. They also demonstrated the potential use as LAIV of the deoptimized H1N1 IAV containing the HA and NA from other IAVs, suggesting that it could be used as new MDV to generate future LAIVs [
