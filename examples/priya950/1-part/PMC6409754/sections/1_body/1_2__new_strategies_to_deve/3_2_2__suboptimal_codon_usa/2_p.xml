<p>By taking advantage of virus and host codon usage and new technologies that allow for 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of modified viral genes, researchers have implemented a new concept for the development of LAIVs by using suboptimal codon usage in viral proteins [

 <xref rid="B180-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. This strategy has been implemented as a mechanism of viral attenuation by incorporating hundreds of synonymous mutations into single or multiple IAV genes [
 <xref rid="B175-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. The use of codon deoptimized IAVs has several advantages over other strategies for their implementation as LAIV: i) they could be synthesized in a few weeks for any emerging IAV once its genome is known; ii) deoptimized IAVs contain the intact WT amino acid sequence and they therefore express an identical antigenic repertoire of T- and B-cell epitopes; iii) due to the large number of nucleotide changes introduced in one or several viral genes, the probability of reversion to a virulent WT phenotype is extremely unlikely, if possible at all; and, iv) they can efficiently replicate in vitro, important for vaccine production, while being highly attenuated in vivo, important for their safe implementation as LAIV [
