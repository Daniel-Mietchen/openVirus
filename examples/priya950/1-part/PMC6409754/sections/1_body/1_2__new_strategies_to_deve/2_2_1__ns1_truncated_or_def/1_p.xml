<p>The IAV non-structural 1 (NS1) protein is expressed early in infected host cells and it plays multiple roles during the life cycle of the virus [
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. NS1 is the main viral protein that is responsible for counteracting the antiviral response and it acts as an interferon (IFN) antagonist to suppress type I IFN production while promoting viral replication [

 <xref rid="B141-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Hence, recombinant IAVs with modified, truncated, or absent NS1 are likely to be reasonable alternatives to generate LAIVs, since they are attenuated in IFN-competent hosts [

 <xref rid="B144-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. NS1 is produced from the eight viral segment (NS), which encodes for two proteins through alternative splicing [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00190-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The primary transcript that is encoded by the IAV NS segment is NS1 and a weak 5Â´ splice site results in the expression of NEP, which is essential for the nuclear export of vRNAs and viral morphogenesis [

Therefore, NS1 mutant IAVs seem to be an excellent option for implementation as safe, immunogenic, and protective LAIVs for the treatment of multiple IAVs in different animal hosts. In fact, the safety and immunogenicity of a trivalent vaccine formulation containing NS1 deficient IAV H1N1 and H3N2 and IBV have been evaluated in phase I/II human clinical trials [
 <xref rid="B160-viruses-11-00190" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. The vaccine was shown to be safe and able to induce significant levels of antibodies in healthy adult (
