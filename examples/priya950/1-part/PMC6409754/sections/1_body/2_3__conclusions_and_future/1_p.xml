<p>Vaccination remains the primary and most cost-effective strategy to prevent and control influenza infections in human and animal populations. The continued evaluation of the safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines is needed to ensure low rates of influenza infection among children and adults. However, efforts should be made to improve the vaccine development process to allow for a shorter timeline from the initial identification of the WHO candidate to the final distribution of the vaccine. In general, LAIVs are more immunogenic and they provide better protection than their IIV counterparts. However, in past influenza seasons, a suboptimal protection was observed mainly against the pH1N1, leading the ACIP to revoke the LAIV recommendation in the following seasons. Although the LAIV was approved for use during the 2018â€“2019 influenza season, the reduced effectiveness of the quadrivalent LAIV remains unknown. This highlights the urgent and pressing medical need of new approaches to generate more effective LAIVs that are capable of preventing or ameliorating the effects of seasonal and/or pandemic influenza by providing broader and more long-lasting immune protection than that elicited by current vaccines. This need is reflected in the current priorities of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Centers of Excellence of Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS),, as exemplified by the strategic plan that was recently proposed for developing a universal influenza vaccine [
