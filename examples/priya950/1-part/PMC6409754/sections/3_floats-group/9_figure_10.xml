  <p>Generation of LAIV based on replication-incompetent viruses: (
   <bold>A</bold>) Introduction of premature termination codons (PTC) into the viral genome: IAV segments PB2, PB1, PA and NP containing four amber codon substitutions for the generation of replication-incompetent viruses are indicated. Packaging signals of each vRNAs located at 3’and 5’ ends are represented in white boxes. Lines at the end of each vRNA indicate the 3’and 5’ NCR. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Schematic representation of the orthogonal translation system: Schematic representation of ribosomal incorporation of the orthogonal unnatural amino acid (UAA) and the UAA-tRNA recruitment during the translational elongation event. An UAA is charged onto a tRNA with the required non-sense anticodon by an orthogonal tRNA synthetase. This tRNA then recognizes its corresponding mRNA non-sense codon in the ribosome, leading to the incorporation of the UAA into the protein of interest. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Establishment of a virion packaging system compatible with the orthogonal translation machinery: Generation of premature termination codon (PTC) viruses are characterized by replication incompetence in conventional cells (left) but efficient replication in cells that contain the cassettes for the expression of orthogonal tRNA (tRNA
   <sub>CUA</sub>), tRNA synthase (pylRS), and a gene encoding an amber codon–containing GFP (GFP
   <sup>39TAG</sup>), leading to viral production (right).
