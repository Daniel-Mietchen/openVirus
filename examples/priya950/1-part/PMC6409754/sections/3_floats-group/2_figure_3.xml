  <p>Generation of the live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV): The LAIV is produced by co-infection of 10–11 days old chicken embryonated eggs with the candidate virus recommended by the WHO (top, gray) and the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 (bottom, black) Master Donor Virus (MDV). After 2–3 days post-infection, the appropriate reassortant seed virus containing the six internal segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) derived from the MDV (black) and the two glycoprotein (HA and NA) segments from the recommended WHO circulating strain (gray) is selected by amplification at low temperatures in the presence of antibodies against the MDV, HA, and NA. The selected LAIV is then administrated intranasally (IN). Amino acid substitutions in the PB2 (N265S), PB1 (K391E, E581G, and A661T) and NP (D34G) viral segments responsible for the attenuated (att), temperature sensitive (ts), and cold-adapted (ca) phenotype of the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 are indicated at the bottom.</p>
