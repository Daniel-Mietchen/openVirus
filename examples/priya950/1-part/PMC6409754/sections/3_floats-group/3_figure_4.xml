  <p>IAV vRNA cloning into ambisense/bidirectional plasmids for the generation of recombinant viruses using plasmid-based reverse genetic approaches. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the ambisense/bidirectional rescue plasmid to generate recombinant IAV: Ambisense/bidirectional rescue plasmids containing the human polymerase I promoter (hPol-I, black arrow) and the mouse polymerase I terminator (T, black box) sequences that regulate the synthesis of the negative sense vRNAs are indicated. In the opposite direction to the Pol-I cassette, and from the same cDNA, the polymerase II dependent promoter (Pol-II, white arrow) and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation termination sequence (aBGH, white box) direct the synthesis of positive sense mRNA to produce viral proteins. Newly synthesized vRNAs generated from the Pol-I cassette are recognized by the viral RdRp subunits (PB2, PB1 and PA) that, together with the viral NP, lead to the formation of vRNP complexes responsible of viral genome replication and gene transcription. Transcription from newly synthesized vRNAs results in mRNA expression and the production of new viral proteins. Replication of newly synthesized vRNAs results in the formation of complementary (c)RNAs for the amplification and synthesis of new vRNAs that will be incorporated into the nascent virions as novel vRNP complexes. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Plasmid-based reverse genetics to generate recombinant IAV: FDA-approved cell lines for vaccine production are co-transfected with the eight (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS) ambisense/bidirectional IAV plasmids. Viable virus recovered from the tissue culture supernatants 3–4 days after transfection is amplified using fresh FDA-approved cell lines or 10–11 day-old embryonated chicken eggs.
