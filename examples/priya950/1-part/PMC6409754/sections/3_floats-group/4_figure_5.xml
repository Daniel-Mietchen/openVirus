  <p>LAIV based on truncations and/or deletion of the viral NS1: Schematic representation of wild-type, WT (
   <bold>A</bold>), NS1 truncated (
   <bold>B</bold>), or NS1 deficient (
   <bold>C</bold>) recombinant IAV. WT NS vRNA is represented in gray boxes. WT NS1 and NEP open reading frames (ORFs) are represented as dark and light gray boxes, respectively. Modified NS segments and truncated NS1 ORFs are indicated in black boxes. White lines represent stop codons. White boxes indicate the packaging signals located at the 3´and 5´ ends of the NS vRNA. Lines at the end of the NS vRNA indicate the 3´and 5´ NCR. Expression of WT NS1 protein (
   <bold>A</bold>) results in inhibition of interferon (IFN) induction and efficient viral replication. NS1 1–126 (top), 1–99 (middle), or 1–73 (bottom) truncations in the NS1 ORF (
   <bold>B</bold>) or deletion of the entire NS1 ORF (
   <bold>C</bold>) result in the higher induction of IFN and reduced levels of viral replication and, therefore, virus production.
