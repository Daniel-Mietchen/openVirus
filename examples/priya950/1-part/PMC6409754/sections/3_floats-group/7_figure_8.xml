  <p>Development of LAIV based on modification of the spliced viral RNA segments 7 (M) and 8 (NS): Schematic representation of WT (A) and modified (B) viral RNA segments 7 (Ms, top), 8 (NS, middle), or both 7 and 8 (Ms/NSs, bottom) in which the overlapping ORFs of the M1 and M2 proteins (Ms, top), NS1 and NEP proteins (NSs, middle), or both (Ms/NSs, bottom) are produced from the same transcript by using the PTV-1 2A autoproteolytic cleavage site. Viral products from the M (M1 and M2) and NS (NS1 and NEP) WT (
   <bold>A</bold>) or modified (
   <bold>B</bold>) viral segments are indicated in grey boxes. M2 ORF is shown as a lighter grey box. Black boxes (
   <bold>B</bold>) indicate the sequence of the PTV-1 2A autoproteolytic cleavage site. The packaging signals located at the 3´and 5´ ends of each vRNA are indicated with white boxes (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>). Lines at the end of each vRNA indicate the 3´and 5´ NCR in the M and NS viral segments (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>). During infection with WT virus, the optimal expression of M1 and M2 proteins (M segment), as well as NS1 and NEP (NS segment) from the spliced vRNA segments, results in efficient virus replication and production. Infection with a modified M segment (
   <bold>B</bold>, top) results in slightly reduction of virus replication and production at 33 °C; and significant reduction of viral production at high temperatures (37 °C or 39 °C). Modification of the NS vRNA segment (
   <bold>B</bold>, middle) results in a slight reduction in virus replication and production that is not temperature dependent. The recombinant virus containing both modified M and NS segments (Ms/NSs) (
   <bold>B</bold>, bottom) results in impaired viral replication and production, similar to the recombinant virus containing the modified M segment (Ms) at non permissive temperatures (37 °C or 39 °C).
