  <p>Production of the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV): To prepare IIV, 10–11 days old chicken embryonated eggs are infected with two IAVs: the candidate virus recommended by the WHO (top, gray) and a high-growth virus (bottom, black). Reassortant viruses are harvested from the allantoic fluid of infected eggs 2–3 days post-infection and the appropriate reassortant virus to be included in the IIV containing the HA and NA viral segments from the WHO candidate virus (gray) and the six internal segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and non-structural (NS)) of the high-growth virus (black) is selected by amplification in the presence of antibodies against the HA and NA glycoproteins of the high-growth virus. Genomic composition of the reassortant virus must be confirmed by sequencing. The selected virus to be used in the IIV is chemically inactivated with β-propiolactone (β-PL) or formalin, concentrated, purified for vaccine production, and then administrated intramuscularly (IM).</p>
