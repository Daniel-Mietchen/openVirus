  <p>Rearrangement of IAV genome for the generation of LAIV: (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) Schematic representation of WT (A) and rearranged viral segments 2 (PB1) and 8 (NS) (B): WT segments 2, 4, and 8 (A) or rearranged segment 2 (PB1 and NEP) and segment 8 (NS1) are indicated with dark gray boxes (B) The light gray box indicates the secondary H5 inserted in the NS segment. White boxes (A and B) indicate the packaging signals located at the 3´and 5´ ends of each vRNA. Black boxes (B) indicate the sequence of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A autoproteolytic cleavage site. Lines at the end of each vRNA (A and B) indicate the 3´and 5´ NCR. A white line in the NS segment (B) represents a stop codon in the NS1 resulting in a truncated (1-99 amino acids) NS1 protein (black box). Expression of NEP from a single polypeptide downstream of the modified PB1 viral segment results in a reduction on the activity of the PB1and an impaired growth of the rearranged virus (B). The expression of the H5 ORF from a modified segment 8 results in an LAIV expressing two different HA (H9, dark gray; and H5, light gray) and the induction of neutralizing antibodies against the two viral glycoproteins.

   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) Schematic representation of WT (C) and rearranged segment 4 (HA) and segment 6 (NA) viruses (D): WT (C) and rearranged segment 4 expressing NA-HA (D) are represented in dark gray boxes. Rearranged segment 6 expressing a secondary HA is represented in a light gray box (D). White boxes indicate the packaging signals located at the 3´and 5´ ends of each vRNA (C and D). Black boxes indicate the sequence of the porcine teschovirus (PTV-1)2A autoproteolytic cleavage site (D). Lines at the end of each vRNA indicate the 3´and 5´ NCRs (C and D). While WT virus expresses the HA and NA glycoproteins from the segment 4 and 6 respectively (C), the rearranged virus expresses both the subtype 1 HA and NA glycoproteins from the modified segment 4; and the subtype 3 HA from the modified segment 6, where NA is normally located (D). This rearrangement of the viral genome results in an attenuated recombinant virus able to induce neutralizing antibodies against the two viral glycoproteins (H1 and H3) (D).
