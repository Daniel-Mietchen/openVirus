  <p>Influenza A virus (IAV) virion structure and genome organization. A) Virion structure: IAV is an eight-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA enveloped virus surrounded by a lipid bilayer that contains three viral glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA), responsible for binding to sialic acid receptors, entry into the cell and fusion of the viral envelop with the endosome; neuraminidase (NA), which removes sialic acids, allowing for viral release from infected cells; and, the ion channel matrix 2 (M2) protein, which is responsible for the acidification of the virion following endocytosis, and viral assembly. Under the viral envelope, there is a protein layer that is made of the matrix 1 (M1) protein, which is involved in virion assembly and budding. The nuclear export protein (NEP) is found inside the viral particle and it is required for the nuclear export of the eight viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm at the late stages of viral replication. The vRNP complexes, which are present in the core of the virion, are made of the negative-sense, single-stranded viral (v)RNAs packed by the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and the three subunits (PB2, PB1, and PA) of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex that are responsible for viral RNA genome replication and gene transcription in the nuclei of infected cells. IAV proteins and their schematic representation are shown at the bottom. B) Genome organization: The IAV genome is made of eight single-stranded, negative-sense, vRNA segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS). White boxes represent packaging signals that are responsible for the selective packaging of each vRNA segment into the virion. Numbers represent the nucleotide lengths of each of the 3′ and 5′ packaging signals in each of the vRNAs. Each vRNA is flanked by the 3’and 5´ non-coding regions (NCRs, black lines) recognized by the viral RdRp for viral genome replication and gene transcription.</p>
