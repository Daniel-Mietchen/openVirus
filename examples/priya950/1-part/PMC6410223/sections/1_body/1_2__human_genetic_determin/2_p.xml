<p>SNPs in viral recognition receptors that elicit immune responses or aid in viral entry into host cells may also contribute to arboviral pathogenesis. Infection with CHIKV activates Toll-like receptors (TLR) that initiate the innate immune response, including inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs. Three SNPs in human TLR-7 (rs179010, rs5741880, rs3853839) and one in TLR-8 (rs3764879) were potentially associated with increased disease susceptibility, as well as the enhanced likelihood of developing fever, joint pains, and rash in those infected with CHIKV [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and this was substantiated by studies in Clec5a knockout out mouse [

The rs4804803 SNP (G) in the cluster of differentiation 209 (CD209) [(encodes Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN)) promoter region could contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Thai and Taiwanese populations [

 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The SNP (A to G in rs1801274 changes histidine to arginine) in immunoglobulin heavy chain receptor FcγRIIa was correlated to more severe dengue infection in Pakistani [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] populations. However, contrasting results were reported for the same SNPs in CD209 and FcγRIIa in Mexicans [
