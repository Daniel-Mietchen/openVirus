<p>The most common arboviruses that have caused recent epidemics are the flaviviruses, including yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Zika, and the Toga viruses, which include Chikungunya. The Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States estimates that yellow fever virus (YFV) causes 200,000 cases and 30,000 deaths globally each year, primarily in Africa [

ZIKV was present for decades prior to 2007 outbreaks in Asia, and was introduced to the Americas by 2014. Over half a million autochthonous and 3700 microcephaly cases had been reported by January 2018 according to the Pan American Health Organization. In the United States and its territories, over 40,000 symptomatic ZIKV infections were reported from 2015 through to October 2018 [
