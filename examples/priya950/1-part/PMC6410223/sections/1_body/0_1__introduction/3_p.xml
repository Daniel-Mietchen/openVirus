<p>There are a number of factors that may have contributed to the recent reemergence and spread of arboviral diseases. Increased episodes of DENV infections are rooted in global population growth, urbanization, lack of mosquito control measures, increased air travel, and decay in public health [

The mild illness in human was proposed to be associated with the maintenance of different endemic strains, which could give rise or co-circulate with the epidemic strains [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The strategy suggested for the prevention of disease is an integrated regional approach incorporating efficient surveillance, emergency response, and case management, as all these factors contribute to a persistent disease cycle [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Severity of the disease was also found to be greater with a prolonged interval between primary and secondary dengue infection in island outbreaks [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00150" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additional determinants of the re-emergence include travel and transport, environmental factors, ecological cycles of vectors, host genetic factors, viral evolution, human and mosquito population density, mosquito species, and vector competence (
