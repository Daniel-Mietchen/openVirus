<p>It is difficult to predict which arbovirus, and when and where it will resurge next because an outbreak depends on multiple factors. While factors such as climate, travel/transportation, human/vector population density, and vector competence are important, genetic changes in viruses are the most unpredictable element. These changes happen quickly and each season can present a new challenge. Development of vaccines has been hampered by immune interference between multiple circulating serotypes, genotype, limited animal models, and a lack of knowledge about immune responses to these viruses and the association between secondary infection and risk of severe diseases [

Although population genetics studies have revealed an association of many host factors/SNPs with infection outcomes, in-depth understanding of their mechanism of action and robust validation of these clinical results are still missing. This knowledge could allow us to take more precautious measures for those vulnerable populations. Similarly, functional validation of viral mutations in infectivity and disease pathogenesis following each epidemic will need significant research efforts and could help us develop broader and more efficacious vaccines and antiviral drugs.
