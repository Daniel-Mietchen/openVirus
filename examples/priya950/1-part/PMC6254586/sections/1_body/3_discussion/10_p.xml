<p>Shanghai is one of the least productive municipalities for poultry in China. Live poultry production in Shanghai gradually decreased from 2013 (26.41 million) to 2015 (19.43 million). Also, poultry consumption in Shanghai is approximately 130 million annually, of which 20% is from Shanghai municipality and 80% is mainly from Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, indicating that most of the poultry consumed in Shanghai is imported from other provinces.

The closure of LPMs may have facilitated the movement of LPAI A(H7N9) virus-infected poultry to the Shanghai district during the ban period. The poultry trade and transportation routes could facilitate the silent spread of LPAI A(H7N9) virus.
