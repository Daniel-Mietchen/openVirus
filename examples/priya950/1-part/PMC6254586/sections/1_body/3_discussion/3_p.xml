<p>It is important to note the phylogenetic subgroup consisting of SD015 and SD016, because the domestic duck could be a key intermediate host for viral reassortment and ultimately produce A(H7N9) virus. It was observed that SD015 and SD016 have different genetic characteristics that appeared in the third epidemic. A duck transferring H7N9 into its environment could potentially lead to the infection of domestic poultry.
