<p>The A(H7N9) virus that emerged in 2013 originated from the reassortment between the A(H7N3) virus HA gene in Zhejiang ducks and A(H7N9) virus NA gene in Korean wild birds, adopting six internal protein genes of the A(H9N2) virus in Beijing bramblings.
 <xref rid="b11-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> HA assists the virus in attaching to and penetrating the host cell via surface receptors, while NA catalyzes the cleavage of sialic acid residues on the surface receptor, which is believed to play important roles in influenza infection. It is noteworthy that a single amino acid mutation of the receptor binding site in HA may contribute to the change in receptor binding specificity.
 <xref rid="b22-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The HA protein harbored G186V and Q226L (H3 numbering) mutations and has previously been identified as being related to a switch in receptor specificity from poultry to human types.
 <xref rid="b23-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Through the tuning procedure of enhancing the affinity to human-type receptors, the virus acquired dual receptor binding capacity.
 <xref rid="b24-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A total of 50 and 51 viruses, including most of the poultry-derived strains, in this study had the G186V and Q226L mutations, respectively, in their HA segments, indicating that most of the Shanghai strain possessed human virus-like receptor preference.
