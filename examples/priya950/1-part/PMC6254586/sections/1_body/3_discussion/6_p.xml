<p>The polymerase enzyme complex essential for viral replication is composed of PB2, PB1, and PA genes. Mutations of these genes are linked with increased virulence and animal-to-human transmissibility.

 <xref rid="b32-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Based on the different genetic characteristics of the surface proteins and internal proteins in H7N9 viruses, it appears that the genetically new H7N9 strains have emerged in every epidemic in Shanghai, posing a risk to public health. Although only non-sustained and limited transmission was detected, a sharp increase in human infections and a higher pathogenicity in chickens were reported in the recent epidemics.
