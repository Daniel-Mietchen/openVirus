<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-idr-11-2411">Figure 3</xref>, the WHO-recommended HPAI A(H7N9) vaccine candidate 17SF003 was rooted from the Shanghai strains. This finding shows that the HPAI H7N9 virus is of avian origin, stemming from the LPAI A(H7N9) viruses in Shanghai. Systemic virus replication in poultry and mammals could be facilitated by the insertion of multiple basic amino acids in the HA cleavage site of the vaccine candidates.

 <xref rid="b30-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> While no Shanghai strains contain these mutations on HA segments, the insertion of multiple basic amino acids in the cleavage site was observed in the vaccine candidate 17SF003. As stated above, most Shanghai strains possessed the QISNT deletion in the NA protein, which may be associated with its increased virulence. These results suggest that most of the Shanghai strains are low-pathogenic and high-virulence strains.
