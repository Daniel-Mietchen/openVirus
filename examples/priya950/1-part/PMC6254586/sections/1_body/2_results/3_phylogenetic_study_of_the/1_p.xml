<p>A total of 59 HA and 77 NA full-length sequences of A(H7N9) strains were obtained from the GISAID database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gisaid.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.gisaid.org</ext-link>) to generate the phylogenetic tree. Both the NJ trees and ML trees, based on HA segments, showed that they shared similar topologies, and all of the H7N9 strains formed a closely related lineage except for four strains, namely A/duck/Shanghai/SD015(SD015), A/duck/Shanghai/SD016(SD016), A/Shanghai/1/2013(SH1), and A/Shanghai/05/2013(SH05), when the tree was rooted to strain A/turkey/Minnesota/1988. These four strains had nodes and branches distinct from other strains in both the ML and NJ methods. It was also observed that the A(H7N9) WHO vaccine candidates were closely related to A/chicken/Shanghai/S4100/2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-idr-11-2411">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The phylogenetic trees of NA segments of Shanghai strains, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-idr-11-2411">Figure 4A and B</xref>, revealed that the ML and NJ trees were broadly similar in topology and the strains formed several clades. Two vaccine candidates recommended by the WHO, 17SF003 and HK125, were clustered with the Shanghai chicken strains of 2014 and 2015 to form a clade. As a result, we inferred that the source of HPAI A(H7N9) viruses came from poultry. Based on the two methods of phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA protein, SH05, SD015, and SD016 produced a branch distinct from the other Shanghai strains and were located closest to the common ancestor.
