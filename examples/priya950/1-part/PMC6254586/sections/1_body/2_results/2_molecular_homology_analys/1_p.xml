<p>Homology analyses of amino acid sequences of selected strains indicated that the variation between the strains showed diversity at the amino acid level up to 4.6%, and 5.5% was based on the surface HA and NA genes, with variable differences being observed based on internal gene sequences. Comparison of the internal gene sequences of the selected strains revealed amino acid divergences up to 2.5% (PB2), 2.4% (PB1), 3.6% (PA), 4.9% (NP), 7.9% (MP), and 13.3% (NS) (

The two recent A(H7N9) vaccine candidates had higher amino acid divergences of HA and NA proteins from the Shanghai strains than the vaccine candidates of 2013. The HA and NA surface proteins of Shanghai strains, with four different vaccine candidates, shared 95.1–98.9% and 96.1–98.9% (HK125), 94.9–97.8% and 94.7–97.6% (17SF003), 96.7–100% and 96.3–100% (SH2), and 96.7–100% and 96.5–100% (AN1), respectively, at the amino acid level (
