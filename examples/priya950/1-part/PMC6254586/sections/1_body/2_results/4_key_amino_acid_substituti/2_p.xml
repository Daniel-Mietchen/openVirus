<p>The HA of all strains from Shanghai included a single arginine at the HA cleavage site, as shown in 
 <xref rid="t4-idr-11-2411" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, suggesting that Shanghai strains belong to the LPAI viruses. Only the vaccine candidate strain 17SF003 had an insert of multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site (PKRKRTAR/G) in this survey (
 <xref rid="t5-idr-11-2411" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). R292K mutations of NA protein related to antiviral tolerance occurred in only three strains, including SH1. A key five-amino-acid deletion in the NA protein at positions 69–73 has been associated with its increased virulence.
 <xref rid="b18-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The Shanghai strains analyzed in this study had a five-amino-acid (positions 69–73) deletion in the NA stalk region, except for SH05, SD015, and SD016.
