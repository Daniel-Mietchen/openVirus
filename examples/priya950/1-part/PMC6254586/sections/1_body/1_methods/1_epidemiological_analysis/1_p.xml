<p>The epidemiological study included all laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with A(H7N9) virus as reported by the WHO website and the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning (SHMCHFP) from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017. Avian influenza reports published by the Department of Health, Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong SAR) were collected as a supplementary source to identify the cases with human infection. Collected information included the month of onset and the patientâ€™s age and gender. For eight human infection cases with data on the onset of illness missing, the date of the onset was calculated by subtracting 10 days from the WHO reported date. We also collected information on preventive measures implemented by the Shanghai municipal government. We defined the first epidemic as being from January 2013 to September 2013, as defined by the WHO, and subsequent epidemics as being from October to September of the following years.</p>
