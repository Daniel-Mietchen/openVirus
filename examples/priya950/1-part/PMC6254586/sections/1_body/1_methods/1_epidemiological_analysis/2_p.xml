<p>In total, 59 confirmed A(H7N9) human cases were identified and included in this research. We generated the epidemic curve using the month of illness onset of reported cases and also described the epidemiological characteristics of reported cases to illustrate five epidemics between 2013 and 2017. Birds or environmental cases contaminated with A(H7N9) virus in Shanghai were also downloaded from the Food and Agriculture Organization Emergency Prevention System for Animal Health (FAO EMPRES-AH). The observation dates of the bird and environmental contamination cases were collected to identify the outbreak of A(H7N9) infection in Shanghai.</p>
