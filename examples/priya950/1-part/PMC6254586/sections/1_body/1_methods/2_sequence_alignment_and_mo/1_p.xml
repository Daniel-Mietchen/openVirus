<p>From the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) Database, we downloaded the full-length sequences of the A(H7N9) virus identified during 2013–2017 from Shanghai, as well as vaccine candidates recommended by the WHO [A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016(17SF003), A/HongKong/125/2017(HK125), A/Shanghai/2/2013(SH2), and A/Anhui/1/2013(AN1)]. As a result, HA (n=59), neuraminidase (NA) (n=77), polymerase acidic protein (PA) (n=56), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) (n=56), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) (n=49), matrix protein (MP) (n=66), nucleoprotein (NP) (n=55), and non-structural protein (NS) (n=66) gene sequences of H7N9 virus were obtained. Using the CLUSTAL W program,
 <xref rid="b15-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> we performed multiple sequence alignments to find the consensus arrangement and to identify the amino acid residues of interest in the proteins. Genetic distances of the selected strains were calculated by pairwise distance calculations. A phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequence of HA or NA in A(H7N9) viruses was constructed for each protein by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method and maximum-likelihood (ML) method using MEGA version 7.0
 <xref rid="b16-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. In the ML method, the Jones–Taylor–Thornton (JTT) model was applied as a substitution model. The A(H7N9) strain A/turkey/Minnesota/1/1988 (GISAID accession number EPI457629) was used as an outgroup to root the tree. The trees were drawn and measured, with branch lengths scaled to the number of mutations per site.
