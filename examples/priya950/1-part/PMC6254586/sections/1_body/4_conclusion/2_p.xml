<p>There are some limitations to this study. First, the human cases of A(H7N9) infection during the second to fifth epidemics in Shanghai numbered only eight, eight, four, and six, respectively. Because the relatively small number of confirmed cases during the second to fifth epidemics makes it difficult to have a large enough sample size to generate meaningful statistics and find statistically significant differences in the distributions of A(H7N9) outbreaks, our estimates for fatality, median age, and gender distribution of the study could be biased. Therefore, it is recommended that well-designed pilot studies, with small sample sizes, or pooled analyses with confirmed cases from other regions, are undertaken to find significant differences in future research. In addition, some sequences or cases have been missed because they were not available from the database used in this study. As the study cases are not representative of the entire H7N9 group, the results could be skewed. Second, for the cases infected with H7N9, access to updated information, including mortality cases, was limited. Further studies including additional epidemiological and clinical information are required for a better understanding of H7N9 human infection in Shanghai.</p>
