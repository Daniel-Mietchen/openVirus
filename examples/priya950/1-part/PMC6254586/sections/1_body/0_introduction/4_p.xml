<p>Shanghai is an international city located at latitude 31°14’N, longitude 121°29’E, in front of the Yangtze River delta area. This area is on the East Asian Australian migration flyway, suggesting the probable contribution of wild birds to the emergence of A(H7N9) viruses because migratory shorebirds are a natural reservoir for avian influenza virus.

 <xref rid="b13-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Several coastal wetland areas, which are significant congregation sites for migratory birds, are also located in Shanghai, increasing the risk of the emergence of novel influenza viruses.
 <xref rid="b14-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It should be noted that the first case of human infection with the A(H7N9) virus was reported in Shanghai early in 2013. Although many studies have been performed on A(H7N9) infection, the epidemiological and evolutionary relationships between A(H7N9) viruses circulating in Shanghai remain unclear.
