<p>Since the first reports of the outbreak of human infection caused by a novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus [A(H7N9) virus] in Shanghai, China, in March 2013, there have been a total of five epidemics up to 2017. As of 31 December 2017, a total of 1,625 human infections with 623 deaths have been reported, with a mortality rate of approximately 38%.
 <xref rid="b1-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Direct or indirect contact with poultry may result in human infection with A(H7N9) virus.
 <xref rid="b2-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Before the fifth epidemic, A(H7N9) viruses circulating among poultry in China had been categorized as low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), and the infected poultry showed no symptoms.
 <xref rid="b3-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Since poultry carrying the LPAI A(H7N9) virus rarely show signs of sickness, resulting in the virus not being detectable in poultry plants or live poultry markets (LPMs), it is difficult to monitor and prevent the spread of the virus, which increases the risk that the LPAI A(H7N9) viruses in poultry could promote human infections and deaths.
