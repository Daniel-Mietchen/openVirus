<p>A recent study suggests that the HPAI H7N9 virus originated and evolved from the insertion of multiple basic amino acids into the hemagglutinin (HA) protein cleavage site of the LPAI A(H7N9) virus. Then, LPAI A(H7N9) or A(H9N2) viruses reassorted with the HPAI A(H7N9) viruses, resulting in multiple different genotypes.

 <xref rid="b6-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Owing to the sharp increase in the numbers of human infections with A(H7N9) virus and the outbreaks of HPAI A(H7N9) during the fifth epidemic, there is growing concern regarding the possibility of a pandemic, which has attracted the publicâ€™s attention.
