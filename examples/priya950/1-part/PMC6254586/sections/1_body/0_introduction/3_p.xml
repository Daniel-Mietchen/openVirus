<p>Although some groups of limited human-to-human transmission have been reported,
 <xref rid="b7-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the A(H7N9) virus.
 <xref rid="b8-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A(H7N9) and seasonal A(H3N2) virus co-infection, which was first reported at the beginning of 2013, shows that people could be mixing vessels and this could promote human-to-human transmission.
 <xref rid="b9-idr-11-2411" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> When human infections with A(H7N9) virus do occur, they are associated with serious illness and high fatality rates. Continuous surveillance is important to identify molecular substitutions in the virus that may have epidemiological characteristics, including increased poultry-to-human transmission and antiviral drug resistance.
