<p>Interestingly, the ovary is also infected by CHIKV, and replication at this site can determine the vertical transmission [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and some authors argue against the infectivity of the virus persisting in eggs [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The transovarial transmission of CHIKV through eggs potentially leads to virus survival in adverse environmental condition (eggs resist desiccation during the dry season) [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. On the other hand, CHIKV seems to perturb the egg-laying pathway—resulting in a lower number of eggs—and survival rate of infected mosquitoes [
