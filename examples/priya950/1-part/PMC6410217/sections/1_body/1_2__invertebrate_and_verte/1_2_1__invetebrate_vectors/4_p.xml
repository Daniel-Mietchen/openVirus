<p>The vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic>, experimentally assessed in 1976 [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], was clearly demonstrated during the outbreak in the Indian Ocean region. During this epidemic, the absence of 
 <italic>Ae aegypti</italic> on Reunion Island was the first clue suggesting the involvement of another vector, and on the basis of CHIKV-positive mosquito pools and competence testing, 
 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic> was designated as being responsible for viral transmission, leading to the large amount of infected individuals [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Phylogenetic studies were carried out and a single mutation in the envelope viral gene E1 of an ECSA strain (alanine to valine at position 226, A226V E1) was considered responsible for the increased fitness of CHIKV in 
 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic> and the consequent acquisition of a more effective vector competence. This mutation promoted viral replication and transmission by this highly anthropophilic mosquito [
