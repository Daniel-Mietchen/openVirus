<p>Given the results of non-human-vertebrates’ natural infection, experimental investigations on host susceptibility to CHIKV were mostly conducted in NHPs and rodents, with the double aim of studying their potential role as a reservoir, and of establishing animal models of infection (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]). These studies show the higher susceptibility of infant or immunodeficient mice (as compared to adult mice), the infection of Rhesus and Cynomolgus macaques (i.e., 
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> and 
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>), widely used experimental models, and of bats—a well-known reservoir involved in the spreading of emerging viruses.
