<p>Studies on the viral tropism demonstrated preferential replication in fibroblasts and monocytes/macrophages, which, nevertheless, are not the only viral targets. Indeed, a number of other cells, including epithelial, endothelial, and muscular cells, are permissive to CHIKV, as established from in vitro studies and supported by ex vivo findings. Nevertheless, the exact cellular receptors for CHIKV need to be definitively established.</p>
