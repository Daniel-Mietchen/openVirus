<p>A second lineage, known as West African (WA), was retrospectively identified in mosquitoes captured in Senegal [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Then, the virus is thought to have moved from Africa to Asia, where CHIKV outbreaks were initially confused with dengue epidemics. Genetic analyses of CHIKV isolated from 1958 to 1973 in Asia placed them in a distinct group called the Asian lineage [
