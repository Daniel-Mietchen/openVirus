<p>Adaptive immunity is mediated by B and T cells. CHIKV induces a robust humoral response leading to the production of anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG [

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot4-viruses-11-00175">Section 4.4</xref>). The importance of T and B cells has also been demonstrated in Rag1 knockout mice (which lack T and B cells), as these animals develop higher viral levels and disease severity compared with wt mice [
