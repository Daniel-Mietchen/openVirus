<p>In infected patients and NHPs, the viral load in blood positively correlates with IFN-α production [

 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], but the IFN-α burden is nevertheless not sufficient to halt the spread to target organs. This can be in part due to the counteraction of CHIKV proteins. Indeed, the viral nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) has been shown to inhibit IFN stimulated JAK-STAT signaling [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], and the nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) contrast viral restriction mediated by the IFN stimulated gene product BST-2/Tetherin [

 <xref rid="B119-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>], should be further investigated.
