<p>To our knowledge, together with the detection of CHIKV RNA in the CVF, which we show in 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00175-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, these are the only reported cases of CHIKV detection in genital fluids, and the tropism of the virus for the genital tract, as well as its potential to be transmitted through male or female genital secretions, should be further investigated.
