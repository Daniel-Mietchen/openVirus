<p>CHIKV is not considered to be a true neurotropic virus (i.e., able to invade the neural tissue and replicate in the neurons), however cases of neurological manifestations have been reported in the outbreaks that have occurred since the ones in Asia in the 1960s and 1970s [

 <xref rid="B170-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Upon the re-emergence of CHIKV in the Indian Ocean in 2005, a growing number of cases of neurological complications (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, febrile seizures, Guillain Barr√© syndrome, and acute flaccid paralysis) associated to this arboviral infection were recognized, and the tropism of this agent for the nervous system was better characterized [

 <xref rid="B169-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. In patients presenting with neurological disease, the virus was frequently evidenced in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by viral isolation or by RT-PCR (systematically reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]), while in the few brain autopsies analyzed for histopathological studies, the presence of CHIKV antigens was not evaluated [

The apoptosis observed in CHIKV infected neuroblastoma cells and astrocytes suggests a direct implication of viral infection in disease pathogenesis. In experimentally infected mice, the virus preferentially infects astrocytes, and, to a lesser extent, neurons, while the infection of oligodendrocytes was evidenced in vitro [
