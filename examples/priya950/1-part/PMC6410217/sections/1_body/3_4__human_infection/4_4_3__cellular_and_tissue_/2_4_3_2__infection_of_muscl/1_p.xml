<p>During the acute and subacute phase, CHIKV reaches the muscle and joint compartments where it gives rise to the two main symptoms associated to this arbovirusâ€”myalgia and arthralgia. During the Indian Ocean Islands outbreak, human muscle biopsies derived from two patients (one acutely infected and the other relapsing) were stained positive for CHIKV antigens in fusiform curved shape cells co-labelling with specific markers (i.e., laminin or neural cell adhesion molecule) of satellite cells [

The same study analyzed the myo-tropism in vitro, showing that, unlike satellite cells, differentiated myotubes were spared from infection. Nevertheless, primary human myoblasts were found to be permissive to CHIKV in a more recent study [
