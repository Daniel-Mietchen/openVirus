<p>The same pro-viral effect of the mosquito salivary glandsâ€™ extract was described upon in vitro infection of skin keratinocyte with an ECSA strain [
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Contrasting results were obtained by another research group, who used IOL CHIKV strains encoding GFP or mCherry reporter genes to infect keratinocytes [
 <xref rid="B144-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. In their experimental conditions, the viral early steps of replication (binding and entry) were completed, while non-structural proteins and genomic RNA were poorly expressed, probably because of an IFN type I, II, and III mediated restriction. Notably, viral infection resulted in a transient induction of type I and II IFN genes, and a continuing increase of IFN-III mRNA (IFN type III being a cytokine preferentially expressed by epithelial cells). The susceptibility of primary human keratinocytes to CHIKV was recently confirmed by Zhang et al. [
