<p>It is noteworthy that, when speaking of viral secondary sites of replication, viral RNA can, in some instances, be detected in body fluid specimens such as saliva and urine. In the saliva, CHIKV seems to originate from oral bleeding [

During the Italian outbreak in 2017, we screened 1414 serum specimens for the presence of CHIKV RNA, and 196 of these resulted positive. For some viremic patients, body fluids other than serum became available for further diagnostic study, and viral RNA was detected in one saliva, one urine, and one cervico-vaginal fluid (CVF) specimen (unpublished data) (
