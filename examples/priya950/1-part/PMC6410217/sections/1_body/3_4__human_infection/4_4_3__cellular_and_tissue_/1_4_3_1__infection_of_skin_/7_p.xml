<p>Interestingly, viral replication dynamics in PBMCs experimentally infected with CHIKV and DENV resulted in a significant reduction of CHIKV progeny and a moderate enhancement of DENV production. Co-infection also led to higher levels of IL-6 and TNFÎ±, implicated in the pathogenesis of the two arboviral diseases [
