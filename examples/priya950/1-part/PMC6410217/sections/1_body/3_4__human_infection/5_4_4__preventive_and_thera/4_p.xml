<p>Because of the limited diversity between CHIKV strains, vaccine strategy represents the best preventive measure to limit the spread of infection and protect people from the disease. Despite the fact that none have been approved, several vaccine candidates have been investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. From the first vaccines prepared using the formalin-inactivated approach, various live-attenuated candidates have been developed and tested [
 <xref rid="B216-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. TSI-GSD-218 was the first live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine reported in trial, and was made using CHIK 181/clone 25 serially passed in cell cultured; it was shown to provide effective and lasting immunity, but in phase II, it caused mild arthralgia in 8% of the vaccinees [

 <xref rid="B217-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>] or codon alteration [
 <xref rid="B219-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. New promising candidates are the replication-deficient viral-like particles (VLP) vaccines (based on cDNA expression plasmid transfected into human cells, and containing CHIKV structural proteins), and the viral vectored vaccines (VVV), which use recombinant replication-deficient viruses as antigen delivery vectors (i.e., the measles virus (MV-CHIV) and adenovirus derived from a chimpanzee (ChAdOx)) [
 <xref rid="B216-viruses-11-00175" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. The VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP VLP vaccine entered a phase II trial in 2015; MV-CHIKV VVV completed a phase II trial with a good level safety and immunogenicity; the ChAdOx1-Chik vaccine is in a phase I trial, and the experimentation is ongoing [
