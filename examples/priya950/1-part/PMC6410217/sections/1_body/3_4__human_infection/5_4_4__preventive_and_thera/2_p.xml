<p>To find an effective treatment for CHIKV, numerous antivirals have been investigated. In vitro and in animal model studies showed that licensed antiviral compounds for other RNA viruses, such as Ribavirin, Favipiravir, IFN-Î±, and Sofosbuvir, may have a positive effect in controlling CHIKV replication [
