<p>Dengue is a vector-borne viral illness in humans, and it is endemic in more than 100 countries (Available online:

Though several screening and control measures have been developed to detect and differentiate them at an early stage of infection [
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], this family of viruses, especially dengue, still poses a great threat to public health. Four different serotypes of dengue have been reported to cause illness in humans (DENV-1-4). They occur concurrently in different parts of the world, and they are the most common viral infection in tropical and sub-tropical countries [
