<p>Transgenic mice over-expressing human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α have been utilized to demonstrate the role of TNF-α in the development of DENV encephalitis-like symptoms and neurotoxicity. Moreover, anti TNF-α antibodies reduced dengue encephalitis and mortality, suggesting anti TNF-α-based therapeutics for dengue encephalitis [

Since mice lacking the IFN-α/β receptor are susceptible to DENV infection and demonstrate T cell responses against DENV infection, studying T cell responses in the context of human MHC molecules might help identify T cell epitopes that are recognized by human T cells [

About 42 T cell epitopes have been identified, and most are also recognized by PBMCs from humans. Therefore, Tg mice expressing human MHC alleles might help in identifying T cell epitopes relevant to vaccine design [
