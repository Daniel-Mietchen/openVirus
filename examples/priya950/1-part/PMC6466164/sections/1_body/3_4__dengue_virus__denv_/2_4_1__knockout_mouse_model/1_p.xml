<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, researchers struggled to develop an animal model for dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. None of them (small animal models, murine models, and hamsters) have shown any signs of dengue disease. Non-human primate models poorly developed any clinical disease and hence were not a suitable model for DF/DHF. This situation led to the development of different varieties of mouse models. Through cross breeding of mice lacking type I IFN receptors (A129) and those lacking IFN-γ (G129), mice that lacked both the type I and II IFN receptors, AG129 mice (

 <xref rid="B105-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] first tested the utility of AG129 mice in DENV vaccine trials. Their study reported that AG129 mice infected with mouse-adapted DENV-2 succumbed to death regardless of age, while immunized mice survived the virus challenge, and survival times increased following passive transfer of the anti-DENV polyclonal antibody. These successful results suggested the utility of AG129 in testing vaccines, as well as antivirals [

 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. C57BL/6 mice lacking only type I IFN receptors succumb to death, even when infected with low doses of a lethal strain of DENV-2 (D220), which was generated by alternatively passaging the virus between C6/36 cells and AG129 mice. C57BL/6 mice lacking only type I IFN receptors in combination with DENV-2 (D220) are being considered as an improved model to study DENV infection and disease and for testing vaccines and antivirals, even under antibody-enhanced infection conditions [
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Studies on mice with the individual deletion of IFNs (type I &amp; II receptors-IFN-α/β and -γ) and STAT genes have highlighted the role of the STAT-1 and STAT-2 protein in DENV biology [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B110-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Mice lacking either STAT-1 or STAT-2 infected with DENV possess a higher level of viral RNA compared to wild-type mice, but they survive. However, in mice knocked out for both STAT-1 and STAT-2, early death was observed. This demonstrated the role of the STAT2-dependent pathway in mediating transcription of the interferon-stimulated genes against DENV in the absence of STAT-1 [
 <xref rid="B111-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Mice lacking IFN response factors (IRF)-3 and -7 have been shown to be infected with DENV by the bite of infectious mosquitoes; infected mice were also able to transmit the virus to mosquitoes. Hence, this model is being used to understand the transmission dynamics of DENV [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Triple KO mice lacking IRF-3, -5, and -7, as well as quadruplet KO mice lacking IRF-1, -3, -5, and -7, have been used to identify the role of IRF-1 in inducing IFN-γ, as well type I IFN, responses against DENV [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Moreover, quadruplet KO mice-based experiments have revealed the role of this alternative pathway involving IRF-1 in resistance to DENV [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. The pathogenic role of CCR5, a chemokine receptor, in supporting viral infection and replication in murine macrophages has been demonstrated in CCR5 KO mice [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Even though the use of KO mice has encountered disadvantages, it has contributed enormously to demonstrating the involvement of several cellular signalling pathways in DENV infection.
