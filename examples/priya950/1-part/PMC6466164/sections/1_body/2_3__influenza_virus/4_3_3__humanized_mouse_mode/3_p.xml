<p>The efficacy of vaccines developed using different strategies, including antiviral DNA vaccines, can be tested in humanized mice models. Ivanova et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] generated anti-influenza IgG antibodies and influenza-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity by constructing a chimeric scFv-IP DNA molecule and administering it directly in experimental humanized NOD-SCID gamma mice. The pTriEx-sc22-IPJun/sc22-IP3-Fos chimeric DNA molecule efficiently binds human monocytes and evokes a strong humoral and CTL response in humanized mice [

 <xref rid="B99-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] succeeded in establishing a humanized mouse model to demonstrate the evaluation of influenza vaccine safety based on the expression of bio marker genes (

 <sup>+</sup> cells, pDCs, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and B cells were retained in the lungs in the short-term model, while human CD14
 <sup>+</sup> cells and pDCs were not detected in the lungs of the long-term model. Moreover, increased levels of human cytokines and chemokines and the expression of human biomarker genes were observed in response to the toxicity of reference vaccines. The observed results suggest that a humanized model can be used for evaluating vaccine safety at the initial level in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
