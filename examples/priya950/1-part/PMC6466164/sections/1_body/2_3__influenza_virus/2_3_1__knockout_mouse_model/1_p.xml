<p>KO mice models have been widely used in understanding the two most important aspects of influenza virus, namely: (i) how the early inflammatory response to influenza virus leads to the progression of lung diseases; and (ii) how reassortment and parental strains differ in virulence. IL-1R1
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice infected with influenza virus were used to demonstrate the role of IL-1α and β in the pathogenesis of influenza. The study revealed that IL-1 contributes to the recruitment of CD4+ T cells to the site of infection and enhances IgM production, but also causes acute pulmonary inflammation [

 <sup>−</sup> mice revealed the importance of IL-18 in restricting influenza virus replication in lungs by augmenting the NK cell response [

 <sup>−</sup> mice. Cryopyrin and caspase-deficient mice succumbed to infection, and their demise was attributed to the reduction in pro inflammatory cytokines which play a central role in innate immunity and in moderating lung pathology in influenza pneumonia [

 <xref rid="viruses-11-00252-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) deficient in the three signalling receptors, namely tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-R1, TNF-R2, and IL-1-RI, were used to determine the combined contribution of the TNF and IL-1 inflammatory response to H5N1 influenza A infection. Triple mutant C57BL/6J x 129S background mice [IL1-RI single cytokine receptor knock-out mice (IL1-R KO), C57BL/ 6J x 129Sv -

These results strengthen the suggested hypothesis that TNF and IL-1 contribute to the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza A virus [

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice. Infection of C57BL/6J background mice with H1N1 influenza A virus from which the FABP5 (FABP5
 <sup>−/−</sup>) gene had been deleted revealed that FABP5 deficiency augments excessive oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation, and inflammation [
