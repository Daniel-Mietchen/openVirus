<p>Tg mice expressing the MHC class I allele, HLA-A*02:01, were used to study the CD8+ T cell response to a heat inactivated H7N3 influneza A vaccine and to a modified vaccinia Ankara vectored vaccine expressing influenza virus epitopes. The studies reported that CD8+ T cells specific to immunodominant and subdominant epitopes were elicited, indicating the potential of the vaccine candidates [

Tg mice expressing the MHC class II allele, HLA-DR3, were used to evaluate the effect of an epitope-based vaccine candidate expressing cross conserved H1N1 influneza A CD4+ T cell epitopes and it was found that the viral load was reduced when the vaccinated HLA-DR3 expressing mice were challenged with pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A [
