<p>Highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 influenza A viruses continue to cross the species barrier and infect humans, causing diseases. Hence, they pose a constant threat and give rise to devastating pandemics [

Tg mice are powerful tools to identify the antiviral power of different human proteins that act as effective species barriers and also to identify the changes required in these avian viruses to overcome the species barriers. The IFN-regulated MX1 gene plays a major role in providing an effective innate immune response to control the influenza virus [

 <xref rid="viruses-11-00252-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) exhibit a higher resistance to H5 and H7 influenza A viruses, but are susceptible to H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses. Moreover, it was also shown that engineered avian H7N7 influenza virus with signature mutations found in human viruses was able to overcome the resistance conferred by the Tg mice [
