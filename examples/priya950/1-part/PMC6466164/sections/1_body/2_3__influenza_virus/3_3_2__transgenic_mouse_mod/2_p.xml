<p>With the help of Tg mice, researchers can implement new strategies against the influenza virus. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] came up with a novel anti-influenza strategy involving short-hairpin RNA (ShRNA) to disrupt the activity of hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus, thereby inhibiting the virus. They developed a Tg mouse expressing an shRNA that specifically targets the conserved sequence of the HA of influenza A virus. The Tg mice displayed a constant ability to reduce influenza A virus infection and replication, suggesting the utility of an shRNA-based approach to prevent and control influenza virus infections in animals [
