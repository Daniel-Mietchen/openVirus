 <sup>+</sup> T-cell activation was observed only in Nef-expressing T-cells, but not in T-cells that do not express Nef. This model helped in understanding the functions of Nef [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A Tg mouse that expresses gp120 of HIV-1 in the astrocytes developed neuropathological features similar to those observed in AIDS patients with neurological symptoms and can be utilized in neuro AIDS research [

The same mouse model expressing gp120 of HIV-1 has been utilized to demonstrate the pathological role of CCR5 in HIV-associated brain injury. Genetic ablation of CCR5 inhibits microgilial activation (hallmark of brain pathology) in a Tg mouse model expressing envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120) that uses CXCR4 as a receptor to induce HIV-associated brain injury. A pharmacological blockade of CCR5 and the acute phase protein lipocalin prevent neurotoxicity in CCR5-deficient mice expressing gp120 of HIV-1 [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Different research groups have used Tg mice extensively for studies related to HIV-associated nephropathy. To list a few, Tg26 and its variants, as well as CD4/HIV Tg mice and variants, have been used [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Tg26 is a transgenic mouse which expresses seven of the nine HIV proteins under the control of a viral LTR promoter. Since the DNA expressed is replication deficient, it randomly integrates into the host genome, and transcription of these genes takes place. Tg26 is used to study the long-term effect of HIV proteins on the host. Tg mouse models which express the entire genome or selected genes of HIV have given productive results and information on pathogenesis [
