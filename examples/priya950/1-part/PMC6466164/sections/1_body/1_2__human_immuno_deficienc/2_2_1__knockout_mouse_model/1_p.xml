<p>Recently, retroviral restriction factors have drawn the attention of researchers. HIV-1 infection and replication is restricted by a number of host proteins, known as restriction factors, that interfere with the critical processes involved in the life cycle of retroviruses. Four of these are sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHDI) [

These restriction factors inhibit viral replication and the production of new progeny virions by preventing reverse transcription, by inducing viral DNA to mutate, and by promoting TLR 7- and TLR9-mediated synthesis of type I IFN by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs).
