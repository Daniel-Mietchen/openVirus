<p>Three common approaches are used to engraft human immune systems into immunodeficient IL2rÎ³null mice. The first model, denoted as the human peripheral blood leuckocytes (Hu-PBL)-SCID model, is generated by the injection of human PBMCs followed by the engraftment of human CD3+T-cells after the first week. These mice develop a lethal xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and their life span is short [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The second model, referred to as the humanized SCID repopulating cell (Hu-SRC)-SCID model, is created by the intravenous (IV) or intrafemoral injection of precise SRC, i.e., human CD34+ HSCs acquired from bone marrow, fetal liver, cord blood, or peripheral blood. This model (referred to as HSC engrafted) affirms engraftment of the entire human immune system. The third model is the bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) model, developed by transplantation of the human fetal liver and thymus below the kidney and IV injection of autologus fetal liver HSCs [

In spite of the development of a healthy mucosal human immune system by BLT mice, the human T cells are educated in an autologous human thymus and are human leuckocyte antigen (HLA) restricted. One of the salient caveats of the BLT model is that, in most laboratories, the mice develop a dissipating GVHD-like syndrome that narrows the window for experimentation [
