<p>Mouse models are the preferred animal models for studying human diseases due to their ready availability, low cost, and convenient husbandry requirements. In addition, species-specific reagents can be used and certain species are amenable to genetic manipulation. With mouse models, the host response to infection can be analyzed in detail and the effectiveness of drugs and vaccines, as well as their safety, can be assessed. However, there are certain drawbacks in the utilization of mouse models for research and in the translation of this animal data to humans. Viruses exhibit high species-specificity and specific tropism, depending on the presence or absence of viral entry receptors, as well as specific innate immune response factors in the mouse cells. Hence, most mouse models show reduced susceptibility to infection by human viruses and do not show disease symptoms. Indeed, with any human virus, investigating immune responses
