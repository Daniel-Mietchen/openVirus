<p>Knockout (KO) mice devoid of specific genes have been used to identify and evaluate the cellular and molecular entities involved in the adaptive and innate immune responses that are important in controlling viral infections. These KO mice include: TCR-B KO mice lacking alpha beta T-cells [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; recombination activation gene (RAG)-1 and RAG-2 KO mice that are devoid of mature B and T cells [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; KO mice for type I and type II interferons (IFNs) or IFN receptors which lack an antiviral response [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; KO mice for immune receptors, such as Toll like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; and KO mice for transcription factors, such as Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) molecules [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that participate in linking signals from receptors to downstream kinases and transcription factors [
