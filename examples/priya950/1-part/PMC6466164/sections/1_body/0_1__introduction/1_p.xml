<p>Infectious diseases caused by human pathogenic viruses remain a huge threat to global health. An estimated 37 million persons are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More than 90 million new cases of influenza occur every year in children aged less than five years; of these, 20 million are acute lower respiratory infections and one million are severe acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) cases [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The mechanisms of how these pathogenic viruses cause human disease differ widely. Using cell culture systems, the effect of these pathogenic viruses on the biology of the cell can be investigated. Organotypic cultures provide an additional opportunity for studying viral spread and tissue remodelling, but offer limited potential for studying host-pathogen interactions [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00252" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Virologists attempt to understand how the replication of a virus within a host induces an infection process which may be associated with symptoms, disease, or a sub-clinical infection. Animal models are important for investigating the exact 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> circumstances, and furthermore, are fundamental for developing counter measures against infectious diseases.
