<p>Genetically engineered mouse (GEM)/Transgenic mouse (Tg) models enable researchers to perceive the mechanisms behind viral pathogenesis. Advances in transgenic technology have enabled the analysis of the role of the specific viral proteins found in affected cells and the mechanisms of host susceptibility and disease symptoms. Researchers have developed efficient tools to investigate immune responses to viral infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mice with germline genetic modifications have revealed the mechanisms involved in viral pathogenesis and anti- viral immune responses. Thus, for instance, to analyze virus-specific T-cell responses, Tg mouse models that express T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenes specific to viral proteins have been widely employed. These transgenic mice include mice expressing a transgenic TCR specific to influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. These mice, when infected with mouse adapted strains of influenza, show both a CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response, and thus have been used to study the role of CD4+ T cells in the activation of CD8+T cells [

Furthermore, many human viruses like hepatitis viruses, polioviruses, papillomaviruses, HIV, and measles are not infectious to wild-type mice, but the transgenic mice expressing specific human receptors that aid in the entry of those viruses are susceptible to many of these viruses. These susceptible Tg mice can be used to evaluate the virusâ€™ pathogenesis as
