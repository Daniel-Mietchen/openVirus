  <p>Mechanistic model predicts consistent low, seasonal risk across states in Southeast region of Brazil, where a large outbreak occurred in 2016–2018. Data are only available until the end of 2016 (blue dashed line), so do not include the duration of the 2016–2018 outbreaks (pink boxes). Only 2001–2016 spillovers are shown (red points), defined as municipality-months with human yellow fever cases. Red points show the date of spillover (
   <italic>x</italic>-axis) and modelled maximum environmental risk in the spillover municipality (
   <italic>y</italic>-axis). Grey lines are municipality estimates of maximum environmental risk and the black line is the environmental risk averaged over all municipalities in the state. Prior to the large outbreak in 2017–2018, spillover had occurred in Minas Gerais and São Paulo (
   <italic>a</italic>,
   <italic>c</italic>) but not in Espírito Santo or Rio de Janeiro (
   <italic>b</italic>,
   <italic>d</italic>). (Online version in colour.)
