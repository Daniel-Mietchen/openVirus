 <caption>
  <p>Partial dependence plots of top six predictors of spillover in a municipality-month from boosted regression tree analysis. Plots are listed in order of predictive importance with relative influence (%) listed. In order, the variables identified as most important predictors were average temperature in the municipality-month (
   <italic>a</italic>), one-month lagged maximum environmental risk (
   <italic>b</italic>), estimated vaccine coverage (
   <italic>c</italic>), average rate of precipitation in the municipality-month (
   <italic>d</italic>), current month maximum environmental risk (
   <italic>e</italic>) and municipality population density (log-scaled for visibility, 
   <italic>f</italic>). Histograms show the distribution of observed municipality-months at each covariate value (left 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis) and solid lines show the marginal effects of covariate on model prediction (right 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis). Marginal effects highlight the characteristics of municipality-months that experienced spillover in Brazil 2001â€“2016.
