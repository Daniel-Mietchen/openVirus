<p>Vector–human contact rates are another important empirical gap in the mechanistic model, which could further refine the relationships between land use, human occupations and behaviour, and spillover risk. We approximate human contact rates with sylvatic vectors with per cent forest cover, but the relationship is likely much more complex. The surprising decreasing relationship between precipitation and spillover probability in the boosted regression tree (
