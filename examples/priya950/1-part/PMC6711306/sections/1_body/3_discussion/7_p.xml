<p>Given the importance of vaccination campaigns in limiting yellow fever outbreaks, we expected that the number of susceptible (unvaccinated) people would be an important positive predictor of yellow fever spillover occurrence, yet mechanistic population-scaled risk performed worse at predicting spillover than environmental risk alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180335F3">figure 3</xref>). For example, scaling by population size predicts areas of very high risk along the coast of Brazil, where environmental risk is low, but population sizes are high. Additionally, we expected that vaccination coverage and human density might be more predictive of the number of cases in spillover events (for example, the recent outbreak in Southeast Brazil) than the probability of spillover occurring, given that very low environmental suitability will be amplified in large, unvaccinated populations. However, vaccine coverage was not a significant predictor of the number of human cases of yellow fever given that spillover occurred (electronic supplementary material, table S5). Anecdotally, it is worth noting that prior to the recent large outbreak in southeastern Brazil in 2016–2018, vaccination rates in the region were low, potentially allowing that outbreak to reach an unusually high magnitude.
