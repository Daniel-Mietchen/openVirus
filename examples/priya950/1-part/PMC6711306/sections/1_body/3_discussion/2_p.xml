<p>Our mechanistic understanding of environmental risk of spillover—which combines reservoir host and sylvatic vector distributions, vector contact with reservoirs and humans, and vector dispersal, survival, infectiousness and seasonal abundance—predicts yellow fever spillover into humans with high accuracy (AUC = 0.72; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180335F3">figure 3</xref>). Within each municipality and month, the maximum risk, rather than the mean risk, was the best predictor of spillover occurrence, suggesting that local heterogeneity in risk within municipalities is important for determining spillover probability. Rainfall-driven seasonality in the vector populations and temperature-driven seasonality in vector survival and infectiousness accurately predicted seasonal variation in spillover (

While interannual variation in risk was not well-predicted in the environmental risk model based on climate and land cover information alone, including phenomenologically modelled variation in primate yellow fever infection prevalence improved predictions of year-to-year variation in spillover (AUC = 0.79).
