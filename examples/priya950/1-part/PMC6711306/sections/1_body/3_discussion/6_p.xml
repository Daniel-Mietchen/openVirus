<p>In a recent publication, Kaul 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] also used a machine learning approach to predict municipality-months with spillover in Brazil and similarly found rainfall and temperature to be important predictors. However, their model also identified primate richness and fire density as important predictors, while our boosted regression tree analysis ranked municipality average primate richness tenth, municipality maximum primate richness fourteenth, one-month lagged fire area ninth, and current fire area twelfth for variable importance out of 14 variables. Our covariates add to those used by Kaul 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] by including vaccine coverage and our mechanistic environmental risk estimate (current and lagged), which boosted regression trees found to be three of the five most important predictors. We expect that our mechanistic environmental risk estimates capture much of the variation attributed to other environmental variables in the Kaul 
 <italic>et al.</italic> model. Despite the differing relative importance of variables for predicting spillover in the two models, they both predict that seasonal patterns vary by regions of Brazil and find Southeast Brazil seasonally suitable for yellow fever spillover. Our mechanistic model further illustrates that this differing seasonality can be explained by seasonal variation in vector survival and infectiousness driven by temperature and vector abundance driven by rainfall.
