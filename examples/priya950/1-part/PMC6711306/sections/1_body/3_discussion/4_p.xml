<p>The recent outbreak is also consistent with the ecological processes driving past spillover in this region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180335F6">figure 6</xref>). While environmental risk in 2016–2018 was not elevated above historical levels (2001–2015) and spillover had not occurred in the states of Espírito Santo or Rio de Janeiro during the previous 15 years, it has previously occurred in Minas Gerais and São Paulo states in 2001–2003 and 2008–2009. Data from the recent 2016–2018 outbreak past December 2016 are not included in the statistical models because consistent monthly municipality-scale spillover data across the country are not available for that period.
