<p>The substantial improvement in model prediction from environmental to periodic risk (AUC = 0.72 versus 0.79) suggests that primate population dynamics, immunity and infection prevalence may be a key missing component of this mechanistic model. Ongoing surveillance efforts in Brazil are used to detect non-human primate cases of yellow fever as an advanced warning system [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. While this advanced warning system can make a critical difference, the recent outbreaks in Southeast Brazil displayed that in some cases this surveillance may not provide sufficient time to respond to prevent spillover, especially in areas with high populations and low vaccine coverage rates, as were found in the Southeast. Incorporating a mechanistic model of non-human primate infection prevalence, driven by local primate surveillance data, could help to indicate when primate cases of yellow fever are likely, to provide additional time for public health officials to respond. This remains a significant and potentially very fruitful gap in our understanding of yellow fever transmission and spillover.
