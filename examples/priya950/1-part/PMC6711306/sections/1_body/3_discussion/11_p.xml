<p>Yellow fever is an ancient, historically important human disease that played a central role in the discovery of mosquito transmission of pathogens and the subsequent development of vector control as a public health measure [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. The wealth of existing knowledge about the ecology of yellow fever virus and its sylvatic reservoir hosts and vectors allowed us to synthesize data from 71 published papers to mathematically formalize our ecological understanding of sylvatic transmission and spillover. Although spillover is a stochastic process that is expected to be difficult to predict, the mechanistic model which integrates vector, human host, non-human reservoir and virus ecology allowed us to predict spillover with surprising accuracy. Historically in the Americas and presently in other regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, yellow fever regularly has entered urban transmission cycles that lead to major human epidemics. The model framework presented here could be extended to include the ecology of different vectors, hosts and environments, including urban

Why has urban transmission occurred recently in Africa and not in South America? What prevents yellow fever circulation and spillover in Southeast Asia, where sylvatic vectors and non-human primate hosts are present and the climate is suitable? Answers to these questions would further our understanding of the ecology of (re)emerging diseases in different parts of the world. More fundamentally, this work provides clear evidence for the predictive power of mechanistic, ecological models—even for rare events like pathogen spillover—and can provide useful information to enhance public health interventions of zoonotic diseases.
