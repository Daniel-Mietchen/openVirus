<p>The boosted regression tree analysis, which aimed to detect candidate drivers of spillover that might be missing from our mechanistic model, identified vaccine coverage, current and lagged environmental risk, temperature, population density and precipitation as important predictors, which together improved upon mechanistic model predictive performance of pathogen spillover (out-of-sample AUC = 0.95). The relative importance of lagged and current environmental risk provides evidence that the mechanistic model captures the potentially nonlinear and interactive relationship between environmental variables that drive spillover in mosquitoes, reservoir hosts and humans better than the environmental variables alone. One-month lagged environmental risk may be more important than current environmental risk for predicting spillover because of a lag between cases and reporting. Additionally, environmental suitability for reservoir and vectors may drive reservoir infection dynamics, causing a lag between conditions suitable for virus amplification in the primate reservoir and vector populations, and spillover into humans. Moreover, the relative importance of one-month lagged environmental risk creates the potential for forward prediction of spillover. The boosted regression tree also identified municipality-months with spillover to have low temperatures. As mosquito thermal performance traits often have steep drop-offs at high temperatures, temperature variation affects mosquito traits [
