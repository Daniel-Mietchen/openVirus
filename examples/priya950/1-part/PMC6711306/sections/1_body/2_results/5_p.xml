<p>The boosted regression tree found one-month lagged environmental risk and current environmental risk to be the second and fifth most important predictors of spillover, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180335F5">figure 5</xref>). Not surprisingly, the boosted regression tree significantly improved predictive performance from the mechanistic model because it was trained on the human spillover data (training AUC &gt; 0.99, test AUC = 0.95). Vaccine coverage, temperature, population density and precipitation were also among the six most important predictors in the boosted regression tree. As expected, municipality-months with spillover had higher current and one-month lagged environmental risk (

 <italic>b,e</italic>), as well as high (phenomenologically) estimated primate infection prevalence and high primate species richness (electronic supplementary material, figure S8). We find that municipality-months with spillover have low monthly average temperatures (

 <italic>a</italic>), which may in part be due to poorly captured effects of temperature in the mechanistic model from averaging temperature before calculating mosquito trait values for survival and infectiousness [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180335F5">figure 5</xref>
 <italic>d</italic>), which may correspond to settings with increased human activity in the forest, and therefore increased chance of spillover. However, current and lagged fire area, hypothesized indicators of deforestation activity, had low predictive importance in the boosted regression tree models (electronic supplementary material, figure S8).
