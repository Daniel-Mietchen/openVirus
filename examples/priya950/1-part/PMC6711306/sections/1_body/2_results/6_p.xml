<p>Unexpectedly, municipality-months with spillover tended to have vaccine coverage above 90%, suggesting that high rates of vaccine coverage do not prevent spillover from occurring. While estimated vaccine coverage was included as a measure of human susceptibility, it is likely capturing other patterns in the spatial distribution of spillover; regions known to experience yellow fever spillover are likely to have high vaccination rates, while those where spillover is rare or non-existent are likely to have low vaccination rates. Accordingly, estimated vaccine coverage is bimodal, potentially due to a group of lower risk municipalities and a group of higher risk municipalities. The partial dependence plot also displays two plateaus in the marginal effect in the vaccine coverage on model estimates, which roughly correspond to the two vaccine coverage groups.</p>
