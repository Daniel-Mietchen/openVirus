<p>The recent outbreaks in Brazil in the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 transmission seasons have been the largest in over 50 years [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The environmental risk model predicts persistent, low environmental risk of spillover in the affected states (Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) and does not predict any increase in spillover risk during the recent transmission seasons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180335F6">figure 6</xref>). The date ranges of confirmed human cases during the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 outbreaks are shown in pink bands (

 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The mechanistic model predicts spillover risk in Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro, where no spillover occurred from 2001 to 2016, at levels similar to those in Minas Gerais and São Paulo, where spillover had previously occurred. As in other regions, the model accurately captures the seasonality of spillover risk in this region (
