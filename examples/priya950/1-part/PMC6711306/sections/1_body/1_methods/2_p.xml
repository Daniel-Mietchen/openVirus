<p>Our goals were (1) to construct mechanistic estimates of yellow fever spillover risk over space and time, (2) to test these mechanistic risk models against observed cases of yellow fever spillover to humans and (3) to statistically test for associations between observed spillover occurrence, mechanistically predicted risk and environmental covariates to identify potential gaps in the mechanistic models. We constructed mechanistic risk estimates by modelling the ecological processes expected to drive transmission within reservoir hosts—vector distribution and seasonal abundance, vector dispersal, vector infectiousness, vector survival, vector–reservoir contact and reservoir host distributions—and the risk of spillover to humans—human population density, vector–human contact rates and human susceptibility (

We modelled several different risk metrics, as described below (see Methods: Spillover model (§2a)). We then predicted monthly risk of yellow fever spillover from the component submodels for each 1 km × 1 km pixel from December 2000 to December 2016 (

The risk estimates from January 2001 to December 2016 were aggregated to a municipality-level estimate to compare with available reports of human cases. Next, to test for relationships that were absent or mis-specified in our mechanistic model, we used both current and lagged aggregated municipality-wide environmental risk from December 2000 to December 2016 as covariates in a statistical model (a boosted regression tree) along with other environmental and demographic covariates to identify the traits of municipalities and months when yellow fever spillover occurred using the available human case data from 2001 to 2016 (

Given the limited time range of some covariates, we extrapolated model covariates for 2017 and 2018 by assuming that they were identical to 2016 or followed the same linear trend as was observed from 2015 to 2016. We then calculated the environmental risk metric for January 2017 to June 2018 in the region where the large outbreak occurred.
