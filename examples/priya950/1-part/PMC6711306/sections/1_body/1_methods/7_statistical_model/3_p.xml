<p>We fitted the boosted regression tree to data from 2001 to 2016, given this was the range of the available human case data for inferring spillover. We partitioned the dataset into spatially- and temporally-balanced training (80%) and test (20%) sets prior to the analysis. Optimal learning rate, tree complexity and number of trees were selected as the set of parameters that minimized cross-validation predictive deviance (electronic supplementary material, table S7; [
