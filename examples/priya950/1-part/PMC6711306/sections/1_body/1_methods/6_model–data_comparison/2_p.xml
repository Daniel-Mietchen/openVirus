<p>We compared spatially- and temporally-explicit mechanistic model predictions for spillover risk with observed human cases of yellow fever spillover using a statistical model. We limited the comparison to 2001â€“2016 based on the availability of human case data. We considered four modelled risk metrics (defined above): environmental risk, immunological risk, population-scaled risk and periodic risk. Because risk was modelled by pixel, to compare the model output with municipality-month observations of human cases, we calculate both mean risk and maximum risk in each municipality and month. While mean risk may be more representative of the entire municipality, we hypothesized that maximum risk in the municipality-month might better predict the small-scale processes that drive spillover. The use of maximum risk may also help to avoid spatial aggregation which can lead to bias or mask the relationships, for example the modifiable areal unit problem [
