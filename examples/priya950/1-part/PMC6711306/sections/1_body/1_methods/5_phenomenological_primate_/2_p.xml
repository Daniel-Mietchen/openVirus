<p>Primate population dynamics and susceptibility have been suggested as important constraints on yellow fever spillover [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which remain poorly characterized. In the absence of primate infection data, we assumed that human spillover events are a proxy for infection prevalence during reservoir epizootics. This is the only mechanistic submodel that uses the human yellow fever spillover data directly—all other submodels are independent of human infection data. For this submodel, we used human cases of yellow fever reported by month of first symptoms and municipality of infection (2001–2016) from the Brazilian Ministry of Health [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. We define a spillover municipality-month as one in which at least one human case of yellow fever occurred. As an estimate of reservoir infection dynamics, we fitted a phenomenological sine curve with a 7-year period [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] to the yearly number of municipality-months with spillover (

 <italic>k</italic>) and then transformed the curve to be positive and less than 1. The resulting curve is used as a spatially constant estimate of primate reservoir infection prevalence. Phenomenological primate dynamics are used in the periodic risk estimate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180335F2">figure 2</xref>
 <italic>o</italic>) to account for a missing ecological process but are not used in any other risk metric, so all other risk metrics are parameterized independent of human spillover data.
