<p>Given limited information on the vector species, we used data for 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys, Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sa. chloropterus</italic> to fit models for the sylvatic vectors collectively for all mechanistic vector trait models. All data used were publicly available or results from previously published papers, as described in electronic supplementary material, S2 and table S1. Additional details on mechanistic model methods and data are available in the electronic supplementary material.
