<p>Most previous attempts to predict pathogen spillover have used statistical models [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These models may be locally accurate for within-sample prediction, but may struggle to detect multidimensional, nonlinear and stochastic relationships among host populations, pathogens, the environment and spillover. By contrast, mechanistic models can test our understanding of transmission ecology, reproduce the complex, nonlinear interactions emerging in disease systems and potentially improve our ability to predict spillover. In particular, Plowright 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] recently proposed a mechanistic model, which remains untested, that integrates multiple ecological requirements to identify when conditions will align for pathogen spillover. Yellow fever in Brazil presents an ideal opportunity to test this model because the ecology of the pathogen has been studied for nearly 120 years [
