<p>Many important (re)emerging infectious diseases in humans—including Ebola, sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, 
 <italic>Plasmodium knowlesi</italic> and other primate malarias, yellow fever and leptospirosis—arise from spillover of pathogens from wildlife or livestock into human populations [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While spillover is an important mechanism of human disease emergence, the drivers and dynamics of spillover are poorly understood and difficult to predict [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Pathogen spillover requires favourable conditions to align in the reservoir (non-human animal), human and pathogen populations and in the environment [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Because these conditions interact, nonlinear relationships among the environment, host populations and spillover probability are likely to emerge. Moreover, spillover is a probabilistic process that does not always occur, even when suitable conditions align. Despite these challenges, it is critical to predict pathogen spillover to enhance public health preparedness. Predicting spillover also provides an opportunity to test ecological approaches to solving globally important human health problems.
