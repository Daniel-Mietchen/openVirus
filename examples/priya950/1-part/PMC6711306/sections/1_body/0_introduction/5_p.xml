<p>Prior statistical models have found climate and weather (including precipitation, temperature and normalized difference vegetation index), non-human primate richness, land use intensiveness and a latitudinal gradient to be predictive of the spatial and spatio-temporal distribution of yellow fever [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180335C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We build on previous efforts by incorporating a mechanistic understanding of how ecological and human population factors affect yellow fever transmission and spillover. A mechanistic model allows known relationships between the environment and transmission mechanisms, estimated from empirical data, to be included to test our understanding of the disease ecology. Additionally, mechanistic models allow extrapolation beyond known regions to identify other regions where conditions are also suitable for yellow fever spillover. We use a mechanistic model encapsulating sylvatic yellow fever ecology to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of yellow fever spillover in Brazil, and we test the model on human yellow fever case data using a receiver operating characteristic curve and logistic regression. Here, we use ‘predict’ to refer to independently estimating spillover risk mechanistically from simultaneous covariates and ‘forward prediction’ to refer to estimating future spillover. We contrast this mechanistic prediction with statistical models that are fitted to the spillover data, and therefore not able to make independent, out-of-sample predictions. We then incorporate the mechanistic model into further statistical analyses with boosted regression trees to understand what mechanisms our model does not capture.
