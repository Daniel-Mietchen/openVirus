<p>Specifically, we ask: (1) Does the environmental suitability for sylvatic vectors, reservoir hosts, vector–human contact and vector transmission—together termed environmental risk—predict geographical, seasonal and interannual variation in yellow fever virus spillover into humans? (2) Are human population size and vaccine coverage, above and beyond environmental risk, critical for predicting spillover? (3) What additional environmental and population drivers might improve predictions of spillover? (4) Do the ecological processes that predict spillover in other parts of Brazil predict the recent yellow fever outbreak in the Southeast region of Brazil in 2016–2018, and if so, was risk elevated above historical baseline levels?</p>
