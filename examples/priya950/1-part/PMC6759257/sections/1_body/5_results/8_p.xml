<p>Collectively, these results suggest that different lineages of RRV were responsible for the 2016 and 2017 outbreaks. The 2016 isolate (MIDI13.2016) resembled strains of RRV recovered from patients in Brisbane (â‰ˆ600 km south of SWBTA) in 2014 and 2015 and belongs to sublineage IIIE. Lineage III is thought to have evolved from 2 other lineages of RRV that are believed to be extinct. The 3 isolates recovered in 2017 (MIDI4.2017, MIDI9.2017, and MIDI32.2017) shared 99.8% nucleotide identity in pairwise comparisons and have been assigned to sublineage IIIF, which contains strains of RRV recovered from the east and west coasts of Australia in 2009 and in an isolate identified in Brisbane in 2015 (BNE 2885.2015).</p>
