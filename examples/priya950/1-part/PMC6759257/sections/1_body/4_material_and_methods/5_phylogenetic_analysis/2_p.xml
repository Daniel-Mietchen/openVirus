<p>Isolation dates of RRV at the tips of phylogenetic trees were taken from the GenBank “collection date” field and estimated to have a precision of 
 <underline>+</underline>1.5 years. We conducted initial analyses assuming a strict molecular clock model because the evolutionary timeframe for this study was comparatively short. However, we also acknowledged that the environmental conditions were sufficiently diverse to warrant a relaxed clock (lognormal). We used the Bayesian skyline as the demographic model for the phylogenetic trees. We performed Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis by using BEAST version 1.8.1 with a 10 million chain length and sampling every 1,000 generations and assessed convergence of parameters on the basis of the ESS value &gt;200, which was viewed by using Tracer 1.6.0. We subsequently generated maximum clade credibility trees after a 10% burn-in protocol by using TreeAnnotator version 1.8.1 and formatted the final trees in FigTree 1.3.1. We obtained all software for these analyses, except Geneious, from
