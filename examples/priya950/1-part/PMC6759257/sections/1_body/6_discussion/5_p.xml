<p>A previous study based on phylogenies derived from short E2 gene sequences identified 2 lineages of RRV (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>3</italic>
 </xref>), whereas a more recent study (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>39</italic>
 </xref>) using longer sequences identified 3 (1 from eastern Australia, 1 from western Australia, and 1 from northeastern Australia). The phylogenetic analyses in our study, which used the complete nucleotide sequences of RRV E2 and nsP3 genes, confirm the presence of 3 lineages but suggest that lineage III should be divided into 6 sublineages. Lineage I viruses were classified as the northeastern Australia lineage; examples of this lineage have not been isolated since 1977. Lineage II was classified as the western Australia lineage; examples of this lineage have not been isolated since 1991 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table 1, Figures 1–8). The virus strain of RRV that was responsible for the outbreaks in Fiji, the Cook Islands, and Samoa during 1979–1980 has been classified as sublineage IIIA. The results of our study suggest that the lineage III viruses have been responsible for outbreaks of RRV infection in Australia since 1991. The temporal structure of the maximum clade credibility trees suggest that RRV is continuing to diversify under the pressure of natural selection and potential for further diversification exists given changes in the virus’ ecologic niche, cycles of transmission, or both. The importance of the 5 nonconservative changes in the amino acid sequences of the E2 proteins that occurred from 2016 to 2017 warrants further investigation to determine what role they might play in viral fitness. The implementation of continuous and routine viral sequencing, analysis, and monitoring will increase confidence in the proposed delineation of the sublineages within lineage III and further clarify the evolutionary process.
