<p>In light of these data, we reasonably believe that RRV has established its natural endemic cycle in SWBTA. The recurrent outbreaks of RRV infection within SWBTA and the intermittent presence of humans in this region suggests that the 2016 and 2017 infections were spillover events in which the virus was incidentally acquired by ADF soldiers from the natural endemic animal-mosquito-animal transmission cycle made possible by large populations of native animals (e.g., kangaroos and wallabies) and the wide variety of RRV vectors (

However, phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequences of the E2 and nsP3 genes of RRV recovered from the ADF personnel in our study and from patients and mosquitoes from other parts of Australia do not support the notion of RRV strains being sequestered in endemic pockets across Australia. Instead, SWBTA isolates bore a remarkable similarity to those circulating in the wider community (
