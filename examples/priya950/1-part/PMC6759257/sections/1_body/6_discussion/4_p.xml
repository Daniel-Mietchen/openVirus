<p>No EPA cases were reported (except 1 case from the administration unit attached to the combat team at SWBTA) from other units at Gallipoli Barracks (a base containing &gt;5,600 personnel who operate across 30 different units) upon the return of the infected personnel. This finding might simply reflect the probability of an extremely small number of infected mosquitoes finding a susceptible and unprotected human host among other units headquartered at discrete localities spread over an area of &gt;200 hectares. However, without concurrent isolation of the virus from local mosquitoes in the vicinity of Gallipoli Barracks, this 2-wave theory, however plausible, remains speculative. Delayed or failed reporting of health concerns or symptoms of infected personnel can be a confounding issue when surveying soldiers attached to combat units. This difficulty is caused in part by a cultural resistance to seek medical attention for ailments of low to moderate severity; soldiers often opt to press on in the face of adversity.</p>
