<p id="Par80">Encephalitis is generally diagnosed based on a combination of clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging features [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can differentiate common aetiologies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Epidemiological factors can guide further investigations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Most CMGs recommended urgent blood and CSF sampling, unless lumbar puncture (LP) is contraindicated due to signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also recommended when possible, or alternatively computed tomography (CT), since MRI can be useful to detect early changes and for excluding alternative causes and is more sensitive and specific compared to CT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It was highlighted that although some specific changes on MRI have been associated with certain aetiological agents (e.g. HSV and arboviruses), it does not always assist in differentiation and findings might initially be normal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. EEG to aid diagnostics was mainly recommended for patients displaying certain symptoms such as altered behaviour or non-convulsive seizures, to exclude non-infectious causes [
