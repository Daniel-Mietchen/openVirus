<p>The diagnosis of respiratory viruses by rapid point of care nucleic acid tests carried out in the emergency department, rather than being sent away to a laboratory, has the potential to dramatically improve patient care during seasonal influenza epidemics. This study demonstrated the feasibility and the high accuracy of rapid RT-PCR assay to detect influenza A/B when performed by trained nurses at triage. Further studies are now needed to determine the impact of such tests on clinical decision making and patient outcomes.</p>
