<p>The rapid RT-PCR assay at triage identified a viral infection in 97 (52%) patients: 28 (15%) patients had a positive result for influenza A, 44 (24%) patients had a positive result for influenza B and 25 (13%) patients had a positive result for RSV. No viral co-infections were detected. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid RT-PCR assay at triage to detect Influenza viruses were very high and only three results from the rapid RT-PCR assay at triage were different from the laboratory assay results. Of these three, two positive results for influenza A at triage were found to be negative in the department of virology. Further analysis of two of these samples, using Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay found one positive and one negative result, findings that were confirmed by the national reference center. The third result discrepancy was a negative influenza B triage result that was found to be positive by both assays in the department of virology and by the national reference center. Thus the rapid RT-PCR assay at triage had a global sensitivity for influenza A/B of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.91–1.00) and a specificity of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.94–1.00). The negative predictive value of the rapid PCR assay was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.94–1.00) and the positive predictive value was 0.99 (0.91–1.00). The results are shown in
