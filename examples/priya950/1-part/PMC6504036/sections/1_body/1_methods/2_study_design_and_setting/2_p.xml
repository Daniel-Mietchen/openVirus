<p>The study took place in January 2018, when the 2017/2018 influenza season was at its peak. All patients were screened around the clock at triage, in an area that accommodated up to three patients and comprised a reception area (approximately 15m
 <sup>2</sup>) and an examination area (approximately 50m
 <sup>2</sup>). It was continuously staffed by two nurses with a third nurse from 4pm to 10pm. The nurses evaluated patientsâ€™ symptom severity, prescribed x-rays for minor limb trauma and provided analgesia, all as part of a dedicated nurse-led screening protocol. For the purposes of this study, additional nurses were not recruited nor were their tasks modified (except for Influenza testing).
