<p>The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the rapid RT-PCR assay to detect influenza A/B, including sensitivity, specificity and the negative and positive predictive values. RT-PCR performed in the department of virology using the Human influenza A/B PCR kit—R-DiaFlu (Diagenode Diagnostics, Ougrée, Belgium) was considered as the reference value for each sample. If different results were obtained by the rapid RT-PCR assay at triage and the laboratory RT-PCR, an Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California, USA) was performed in the virology lab and a sample was also sent for analysis to the national influenza virus reference center (Centre National de Référence du Virus Influenza Région Sud, Lyon, France).</p>
