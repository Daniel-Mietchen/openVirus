<p>At triage, the Roche cobas influenza A/B Nucleic Acid test, a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waived RT-PCR assay, was used on the cobas Liat system to detect Influenza A, Influenza B, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). One cobas Liat system was located in the triage examination area. Before the study, the triage nurses were trained to perform the nasopharyngeal swab sample and to run the rapid RT-PCR assay. The training consisted of a 10-minute video explaining the swab sampling process followed by 30 minutes of hands-on training in the use of the rapid RT-PCR assay. Following their swab, patients then either returned to the waiting room or were admitted to the emergency department monitoring area, depending on the severity of their symptoms.</p>
