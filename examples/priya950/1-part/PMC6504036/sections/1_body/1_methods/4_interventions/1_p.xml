The tip of the swab was placed into the liquid transport media inside a sterile viral sample tube (Sigma Virocult, MWE, Wiltshire, England) and the applicator stick was cut off. After 1 minute, 200 μL of this sample was taken to perform the rapid RT-PCR assay

The remainder of the sample was sent to the hospital virology laboratory for identification using the reference RT-PCR assay Human Influenza A/B PCR kit—R-DiaFlu (Diagenode Diagnostics, Ougrée, Belgium). The staff who performed the RT-PCR assay in the Virology Laboratory were unaware of the rapid RT-PCR assay results from the triage assay.
