<p>Virus inactivation assays were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, ZIKV-MR766 or ZIKV-PF13 (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU) were mixed with 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract (100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Simultaneously, the same amount of virus was incubated with the medium without the plant extract as a control. The mixture (plant extract-virus) was then diluted 50-fold (final virus concentration, 1 PFU/cell) with MEM containing 2% FCS to yield a subtherapeutic concentration of plant extract, and the mixture was subsequently added to a Vero cell monolayer seeded in 6-well plates. As a comparison, ZIKV was mixed with 
 <italic>P. mauritanum</italic>, diluted immediately to 50-fold without an incubation period and added to the Vero cells for infection. The 50-fold dilution served to titrate the plant extract below its effective dose and prevent meaningful interactions with the host cell surface. The inocula were discarded after 2 h of adsorption at 37 °C, the cells were washed with PBS twice and the incubation was maintained for 24 h at 37 °C before being subjected to cytometry or immunofluorescence assays as described above.
