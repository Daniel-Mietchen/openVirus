<p>Vero cells (ATCC, CCL-81) and human-derived Huh7.5 hepatoma cells (ATCC, PTA-8561TM; Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in an Eagle minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with a 5% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 2 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> L-Glutamine, 1 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> sodium pyruvate, 100 U mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of penicillin, 0.1 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of streptomycin and 0.5 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of fungizone (Amphotericin B) (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) under a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37 °C. A549 cells (ATCC, CCL-185) were cultured in DMEM glutamax supplemented with 10% of FBS, 100 U mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of penicillin, 0.1 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of streptomycin and 1% of non-essential amino acid (NEAA). Primary human keratinocytes plasty mammary (HKPM) and fibroblast (FMa) cultures were established by outgrowth from biopsies obtained immediately after breast plastic surgery from healthy donors, with their informed consent (Centre Hospitalier de Grenoble, Grenoble, France). Keratinocytes were cultured in Keratinocyte Serum-Free medium (KSFM) supplemented with 25 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> Bovine Pituitary Extract (BPE), 1.5 ng mL
 <sup>−1</sup> Epidermal Growth Factors (EGF) and 75 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> primocin. C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells (ATCC CRL-1660, Manassas, VA, USA) were maintained at 27 °C in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% P/S, 1% MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids solution (Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 2% Tryptose Phosphate Browth (Gibco). The clinical isolate PF-25013-18 of ZIKV has been previously described [

 <sup>MC-MR766NIID</sup> and the GFP-expressing strain of ZIKV
 <sup>MC-MR766NIID</sup> (ZIKV
 <sup>GFP</sup>) are molecular clones of the ancestral strain MR766 of ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. DENV-1/FGA/89 was isolated in 1989 from a South American patient suffering from DF (GenBank: AF226687). DENV-2/ICC-265 was isolated from a DF patient in Brazil in 2009. DENV3/5532 was isolated in 2007 from a fatal case of dengue with visceral manifestations in a patient in Paraguay (GenBank: HG235027). DENV-4/TVP360 is a laboratory strain that was kindly provided by Dr. Ricardo Galler (Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; GenBank: KU513442). DENV stocks were grown in C6/36 cells and titrated by a foci-forming immunodetection assay. Vero cells were infected with a MOI of 1. ZIKV strains were amplified on Vero cells. The anti-pan flavivirus E monoclonal antibody 4G2-Alexa Fluor 594 was purchased from RD Biotech.
