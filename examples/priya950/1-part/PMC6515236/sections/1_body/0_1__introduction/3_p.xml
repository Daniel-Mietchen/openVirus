<p>Medicinal plants, which have been used as a treatment or prevention against several human infectious diseases for millenaries, remain a remarkable potential source of antiviral compounds against flaviviruses [

 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Reunion Island, which belongs to the Mascarene Archipelago, is classified as a biodiversity hotspot due to its exceptional flora and endemic plants. These could provide active phytochemicals against viral infections [

 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Phytochemicals, including alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, terpenoids, polyphenolics and saponins, have already been described for their antiviral activity against numerous enveloped RNA viruses including flaviviruses [

 <xref rid="B23-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Indeed, the polyphenols epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from green tea, delphinidin, and curcumin, have been found to inhibit ZIKV and DENV infection [

 <xref rid="B27-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We recently reported that a polyphenol-rich extract from 
 <italic>Aphloia theiformis</italic>, an indigenous medicinal plant from Reunion Island, prevents ZIKV and DENV infection through an inhibition of the virus entry steps [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. 
 <italic>Psiloxylon mauritianum</italic>, an endemic medicinal plant recently listed in the French pharmacopoeia, has been extensively used in folk medicine among the local people of the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean [
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Given the high content of polyphenols in a 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract, we decided to evaluate its ability to inhibit ZIKV and DENV infection. In the present study, we showed that 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> severely restricts the binding of virus particles to the host-cells.
