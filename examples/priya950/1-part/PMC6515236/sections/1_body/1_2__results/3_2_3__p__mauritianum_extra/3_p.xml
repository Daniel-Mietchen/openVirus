<p>In parallel, the viral protein production was evaluated 24 hp.i by immunofluorescence assays, using an antibody that recognizes the viral protein E. The EGCG treatment was used as a positive control. To determine whether the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract exhibited an antiviral activity against another viral strain, the contemporary Asian lineage ZIKV-PF13, which was responsible for the epidemic in 2013 in French Polynesia, was included in the analysis [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The production of the viral protein E of both strains was affected by 100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The percentage of ZIKV-infected cells was reduced to 16% and 9% in the presence of 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic>, upon infection with ZIKV-MR766 and ZIKV-PF13, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C). By contrast, up to 60% of the non-treated cells were infected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C). The extract was as potent as EGCG in inhibiting the ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C). In this assay, ZIKV-PF13 was as sensitive as the African lineage to the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> treatment.
