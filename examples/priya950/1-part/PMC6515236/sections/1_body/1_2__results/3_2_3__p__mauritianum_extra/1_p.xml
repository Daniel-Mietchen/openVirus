<p>To further validate the potential anti-ZIKV activities of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract, the African lineage strain ZIKV-MR766 was incubated with the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract for 1 h at 37 Â°C prior to the Vero cells infection through the viral inactivation assay. Several methods were used to assess the viral infection: the viral replication was evaluated by the presence of single-stranded viral RNA (ssRNA) using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)-based assays, the viral protein production was quantified by immunofluorescence assays and the viral production was measured by plaque forming assays.
