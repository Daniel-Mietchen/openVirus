<p>Prior to evaluating the potential antiviral activity of the 
 <italic>Psiloxylon mauritianum</italic> extract, we determined whether it exhibited cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on different mammalian cell lines, using MTT and COMET assays, respectively. The cells were treated with different concentrations of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract ranging from 4 to 2000 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The results showed a concentration-dependent toxicity with a cell viability beginning to decrease starting at concentrations higher than 250 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The cytotoxic concentration that inhibited 50% of the cell viability (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was 1044 ± 106.2 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 657 ± 15.7 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, for Vero and A549 cells, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). We also determined the CC
 <sub>50</sub> on human primary keratinocytes (HKPM) and fibroblast (FMa) cells. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f001">Figure 1</xref>B shows dose-response curves, with a CC
 <sub>50</sub> for HKPM and FMa of 353 ± 84.4 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 820 ± 26.5 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). We next determined the maximal noncytotoxic concentration (MNTC) on different mammalian cell lines, using a nonlinear regression curve. The concentration of 100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract, that maintained 90% of Vero and A549 cell viability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), was chosen to test the potential antiviral activity of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract on Vero cells.
