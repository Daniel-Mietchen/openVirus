<p>We next wondered if the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract exerts an antiviral activity against DENV, another medically-relevant flavivirus. The anti-DENV activity of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract was evaluated using four different serotypes (clinical isolates for DENV1-3 and a DENV-4 lab-adapted strain). The treatment with IFN-α 2A, which is known to block DENV replication [

 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract (100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was pre-incubated with the four different serotypes of DENV for 1 h at 37 °C prior to infection. The human hepatoma cell lines Huh7.5, which are extensively used in Flaviviridae research and relevant for DENV infection [

 <xref rid="B37-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], were used to perform these experiments. The cytotoxicity effect of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract on Huh7.5 cells was first evaluated using MTT assays. The concentration of 100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> did not affect the cell viability after 48 h of treatment (
