<p>To assess the antiviral activity and determine which steps of viral replication were affected by the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract, time-of-drug-addition assays were performed in Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f002">Figure 2</xref>A), as previously described [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], using a chimeric molecular clone of the ZIKV strain MR766 expressing a GFP reporter gene (ZIKV
 <sup>GFP</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This virus allows the monitoring of viral replication by assessing GFP fluorescence by flow cytometry. The ‘pre-adsorption’ experimental condition provides an insight into the ability of the plant extract to prevent a ZIKV infection by potentially interacting with ZIKV receptors or inducing an immuno-stimulating effect. The ‘adsorption’ experimental condition evaluates the capacity of the plant extract to interfere with the internalization process of the viral particles into the host-cell. The ‘post-adsorption’ experimental condition determines whether the extract is efficient at inhibiting the intracellular replication and polyprotein processing/synthesis of ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. When 100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract was added throughout the experiment and concomitantly to the virus for 2 h (adsorption), the fluorescence intensity representing the viral replication was detected only in 2% of cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). By contrast, no effect was observed when the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract was added at pre-adsorption or 2 h post-adsorption (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). These results suggest that the antiviral activity of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract was not mediated by the inhibition of the viral protein production but rather by the inhibition of early steps of the viral replication, possibly viral entry mechanisms.
