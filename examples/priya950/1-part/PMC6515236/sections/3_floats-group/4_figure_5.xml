  <p>The 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract reduces the viral progeny production of the African and Asian ZIKV lineages. (
   <bold>A</bold>) ZIKV-MR766 or (
   <bold>B</bold>) ZIKV-PF13 were incubated with different concentrations of the 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract for 1 h at 37 °C. The Vero cells were infected at a MOI of 1 for 24 h. The release of infectious viral particles was measured by plaque forming assays. The results shown are the means ± SD of three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons (**
