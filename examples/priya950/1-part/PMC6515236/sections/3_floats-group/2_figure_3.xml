   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract inhibits the production of ZIKV ssRNA. ZIKV-MR766 particles were incubated with the 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract for 1 h at 37 °C. The EGCG treatment (100 µM) was used as positive control. Vero cells were left uninfected or were infected at an MOI of 1 for 24 h. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Cells were processed for FISH using a probe specific for viral RNA (red) and then stained with NucBlue to visualize the nuclei (blue). Cell membranes were stained with AF488-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin. Images are representative of three independent experiments. Scale bars are 20 μm. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Quantification of ZIKV ssRNA spots counted per field (fields contained on average 300 cells) from the experiments represented in the images. Data are means ± SD of three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons (****
