  <p>The cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract on mammalian cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Vero and A549 cells were incubated with different concentrations of the 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract for 24 h. The cell viability was determined using the metabolic activity by an MTT assay. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Human primary keratinocytes (HKPM) and fibroblasts (FMa) were treated with an increased concentration of the 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract for 24 h, and their viability was evaluated by an MTT assay. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) The results are the means ± SD of three independent experiments and are expressed as the relative value compared to untreated cells. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Human cells (A549, HKPM and FMa) were treated 24 h with 100 µg mL
   <sup>−1</sup> of the 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract. The cells were treated 10 min with H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> (50 µM) as a positive control. The genotoxicity was determined by observation of DNA degradation using a COMET assay visualized by Gel Red. The images are representative of three independent experiments. Scale bars are 50 µm. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The quantification of the COMET signal from the experiments represented in the images by using a COMET assay IV software. The results are means ± SD of three independent experiments and are expressed as the percentage of the tail intensity. A one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons were used for the statistical analysis (***
