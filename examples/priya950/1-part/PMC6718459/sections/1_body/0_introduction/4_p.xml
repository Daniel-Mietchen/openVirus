<p>Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted viral infection of high incidence worldwide (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It is caused by four anti-genetically related but distinct dengue virus (DENV) serotypes belonging to the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These pathogens are estimated to cause up to 390 million infections and 20,000 deaths annually around the world (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). DENV are transmitted mainly by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, and the infection results in a range of clinical outcomes: asymptomatic (most common) or mildly symptomatic illness, uncomplicated dengue fever, or more severe disease including plasma leakage, hemorrhage, and vascular collapse (dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome) (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Taking into account the high incidence of the disease, vaccines should be the main approach for controlling dengue epidemics. However, the pathway to developing an effective vaccine is a complex challenge. The main obstacles have been the lack of suitable animal models, the necessity of a tetravalent formulation to protect against each viral serotypes and the lack of a correlate of protection (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Until a surrogate or correlate of protection is established, efficacy trials of dengue vaccines will need to be conducted based on clinical endpoints, following the virologically-confirmed dengue cases of any severity due to any serotype (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Moreover, the induction of short-term protection or waning immunity constitutes a big problem because vaccine-recipients can become susceptible to developing severe dengue during a natural infection.
