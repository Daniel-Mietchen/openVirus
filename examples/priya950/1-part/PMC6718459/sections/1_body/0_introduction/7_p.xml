<p>Another LATV in phase III clinical trial was developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). This vaccine combined the molecular attenuation of DENV by deletions in the 3â€² untranslated region and structural gene chimerization. This vaccine candidate is well-tolerated in humans and induces neutralizing antibodies and a cellular immune response, after only one dose. Also, this vaccine protects volunteers after challenge with partially-attenuated strains of DENV-2 or DENV-3 (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, it provokes rash in more than 60% of those vaccinated (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The third vaccine candidate in phase III clinical testing is based on the attenuated strain of DENV-2 PDK-53 and only contains the capsid and the non-structural proteins of this serotype (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).Therefore, vaccination with this candidate, developed by Takeda, could, in principle, limit the generation of a broad cell-mediated immunity.
