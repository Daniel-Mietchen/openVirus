<p>Currently, only three live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccines (LATVs) have entered or completed phase III clinical trials (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Only one of them, Dengvaxia®, from Sanofi Pasteur have been approved and licensed in 20 countries (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The vaccine was obtained by the substitution of the genes that encode for premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins of the attenuated yellow fever virus (YFV) 17D vaccine strain for the prM and E genes of each DENV. These chimeric viruses only induce neutralizing antibodies against the four DENV after three doses given 6 month apart (

Unfortunately, none or a very low DENV-specific cellular immune response is generated with the vaccine because chimeric viruses lack capsids and the non-structural proteins 3 and 5 of DENV, which are the main targets of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against these pathogens (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). A recent study conducted with this vaccine demonstrated that the rates of hospitalization among dengue-seronegative vaccinees were higher in the vaccine group than in the control (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that Dengvaxia® partially mimics the primary infection in dengue-naïve individuals and increases the risk of severe dengue during a subsequent infection, similar to the risk observed after natural secondary infections. This fact gives important insights into the understanding of dengue protective immunity and it has generated questions for the next outcomes of dengue vaccine efficacy trials (
