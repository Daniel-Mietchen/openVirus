<p>One of the attractive alternatives to solving the main disadvantages of LATV (reactogenicity and low efficacy profiles) could be the use of a complementary prime-boost strategy based on combinations of different antigens during the immunizations. These combinations have potential advantages in dengue field, because they could improve the immunogenicity and/or protection against the four DENV. Also, they could reduce the number of doses or the time between doses during immunization schedules. On the other hand, the use of this regimen of immunization could help to induce a balanced immune response against the four serotypes. This review discusses the recent advances in complementary prime-boost immunization strategies used during dengue vaccine development, the main results obtained, as well as the benefits and limitations of these strategies.</p>
