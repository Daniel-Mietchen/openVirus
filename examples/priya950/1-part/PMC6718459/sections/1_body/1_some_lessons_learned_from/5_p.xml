<p>A specific prime-boost strategy has also been employed against HCV. Chronically infected patients were primed with a DNA vaccine expressing the proteins NS3/4A from the HCV genotype 1a and later boosted with a modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing the proteins NS3/4/5B from genotype 1b. This strategy induced high levels of CD8+T cells and shifted the immune response toward a Th1 pattern (

Both studies suggest that different combinations could induce the required/desired immune response; therefore, the best regimen of immunization will be selected taking into account the troubles faced during the development and/or production of antigens, the prices for their obtaining, etcetera.
