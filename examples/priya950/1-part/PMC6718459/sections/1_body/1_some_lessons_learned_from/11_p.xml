<p>Although BCG is a strong inducer of Th1 responses, the incidence of TB increases with the time after the first immunization (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), suggesting that the wane of the immunological memory after BCG vaccination is one of the causes of its low protective efficacy. However, this waning immunity cannot be avoided by revaccination (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>); therefore, prime-boost immunization strategy could be an attractive approach post-vaccination with BCG. Complementary prime-boost vaccination strategy is known to be highly effective for enhancing anti-TB T cell-mediated immunity (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The waning immunity constitutes an additional factor to consider prime-boost strategies as promising vaccine alternatives. In the specific case of viruses, attenuated vaccines could have the same disadvantage. In that case complementary prime-boost approaches could be a potential solution.
