<p>With this scenario and knowing the complexity associated to a DENV vaccine due to the immunopathological phenomena that produce the severe form of the disease, the researchers must find new vaccine candidates or vaccine strategies to control this threatening pathogen. Subunit vaccines could be an attractive alternative, because they are usually safe and can be administered in babies younger than 1-year-old but, unfortunately, they are less immunogenic than replicative immunogens. However, a combination of non-replicative and replicative antigens in prime-boost immunization strategies could be an attractive approach. Obviously, the strategy must induce a long-term safety profile avoiding or controlling the waning immunity and reducing the risk of severe dengue over time after vaccination.</p>
