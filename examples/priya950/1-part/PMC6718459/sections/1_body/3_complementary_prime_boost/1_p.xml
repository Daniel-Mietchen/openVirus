<p>In the specific case of DENV, prime-boost immunization strategies should be directed to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies with the main aim to avoid the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection and also to induce and/or boost a potent cell-mediated immune response for controlling infected cells. In addition it has been demonstrated that a polyfunctional T-cell response could control the viremia produced under ADE conditions (
