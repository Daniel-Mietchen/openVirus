<p>Multiple vaccine candidates have been developed against DENV, each one with its advantages and disadvantages, but unfortunately there is no a safe and efficacy vaccine against DENV neither antiviral drugs for the treatment of infected patients. From the disappointed results obtained with Dengvaxia® several concerns have arisen about the rationality of many vaccine designs previously tested. For many years researchers have proposed the development of neutralizing antibodies as the main response to achieve protection against DENV, but the lack of correlation between this response and protection observed in animals models and human (

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) has challenge this assumption. No protection against DENV-2 was observed in individuals vaccinated with Dengvaxia during a phase IIb clinical trial, despite the induction of neutralizing antibodies against this virus serotype (

Although prime-boost immunization strategies have been previously evaluated against this virus in animal models, none of them have demonstrated to be completely efficacious. However, a prime-boost regimen could be the solution for this complex and threatening disease. Several regimens have been evaluated combining non-replicative antigens and/or replicative vectors in animal models (
