<p>Finally, in 2017 Gil et al. reported a last study of prime-boost immunization regimen combining recombinant proteins and infective viruses (

In this study, rhesus monkeys from Reu Island in Vietnam were experimentally infected with DENV-1, DENV-3, or DENV-4 and 8 month later, the immune response generated by the infection was boosted with one dose of the tetravalent formulation of DIIIC proteins (each one, obtained by the fusion of DIII fused to the homologous capsid protein) (Tetra DIIIC) (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). As it was expected animals developed virus-binding and neutralizing antibodies that were significantly boosted after the administration of Tetra DIIIC. Moreover, the memory IFNÎ³-producing cells generated by the viruses were successfully recalled by the DIIIC proteins (

These results highlight the potentiality of Tetra DIIIC as a vaccine candidate against DENV and also its usefulness in prime-boost immunization strategies employing live-attenuated viruses. Obviously, the immunization with live-attenuated viruses will generate memory B and T cells that can be successfully recalled after the administration of Tetra DIIIC, increasing the duration and maturation of the DENV-specific immune response. However, another combination could be also attractive. Priming with Tetra DIIIC can generate an immune response that should reduce the replication of live-attenuated viruses, normally associated with the reactogenicity of this kind of vaccine candidates, without affecting the protective capacity of the combination (
