<p>Recently, this group evaluated the combination of Tetra DIIIC with the formulation TV005 (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>) developed by the NIH and licensed to the Vietnamese company Vabiotech. Results demonstrate that animals primed with Tetra DIIIC and later immunized with TV005 developed neutralizing antibodies and protective immune responses against the four DENV serotypes. Additionally, the immune response generated by Tetra DIIIC significantly reduced the viremia produced by the live attenuated viruses (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). Although it has been suggested that all four viruses of TV005 vaccine must produce measurable viremia to ensure the induction of homotypic immunity, there is ample data demonstrating that this formulation induces neutralizing antibodies against the four DENV serotypes in &gt;90% of those vaccinated in the absence of detectable viremia (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Thus, the drop in TV005 vaccine replication produced by the previous administration of Tetra DIIIC has obvious and important clinical implications, as it implies that Tetra DIIIC may represent a potential solution to the reactogenicity problems that have plagued the NIAID's vaccine candidate (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Further studies should be conducted to evaluate new combinations of these vaccines, as a prime-boost strategy in the reverse order might improve the maturation and duration of the immune response against the four DENV serotypes.
