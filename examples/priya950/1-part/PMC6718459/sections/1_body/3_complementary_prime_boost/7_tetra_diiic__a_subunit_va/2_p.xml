<p>Two additional studies performed by this group confirm the previous statement. In 2011, these researchers did similar work in monkeys using a new recombinant protein. For this experiment they combined the chimeric protein DIIIC-2 (a fusion protein including DIII region of DENV-2 fused to the N-terminus of the capsid protein from the corresponding serotype) and the infective DENV-2. Animals received one dose of the infective DENV-2 and then were boosted 3 months later with the recombinant protein DIIIC-2. As a result, the animals developed a neutralizing antibody response after the virus infection that was notably boosted after the dose with the chimeric protein DIIIC-2. The neutralizing antibodies induced were long-lasting and a DENV-2-specific cell-mediated immunity was detected 6 months after the booster dose. As conclusion, authors stated that DIII region, when it is properly presented to the immune system, is able to recall a neutralizing antibody response generated by the homologous virus infection in monkeys (
