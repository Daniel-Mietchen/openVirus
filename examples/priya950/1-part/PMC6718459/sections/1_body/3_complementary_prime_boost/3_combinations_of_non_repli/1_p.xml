<p>In 2001, Simmons et al. combined a DNA vaccine encoding for pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins from DENV-2 and a recombinant fusion protein containing the domain III (DIII) of DENV-2 E protein fused to the maltose-binding protein of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. This strategy was tested in BALB/c mice evaluating two combinations (priming with DNA and boosting with the recombinant protein or 
 <italic>vice versa</italic>). Additionally, a group of animals received both antigens at the same time. Both combinations induced a humoral immune response in terms of antiviral and neutralizing antibodies. However, the highest titers of long-lasting neutralizing antibodies were elicited in animals that were co-immunized with both antigens (
