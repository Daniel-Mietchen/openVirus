<p>Another study combined two plasmids for priming and two recombinant proteins for boosting. DNA plasmids encoded for DENV-2 E and NS1 proteins, respectively, and the recombinant proteins included the same antigens, each fused to the carrier protein Glutathione S Transferase (GST): E-GST and NS1-GST. Both plasmids were co-administrated in BALB/c mice followed by a single dose with both recombinant proteins. The rational design was the inclusion of a broad source of B- and T-cell epitopes, involved in the protective immunity using different regions of the virus. However, this work only evaluated the neutralizing antibody response. The prime-boost immunization strategy showed an increased antibody response to NS1 and E proteins compared to animals that were only vaccinated with the recombinant proteins or DNA constructs (

They used a new plasmid that included the regions of domain II and III of the E protein and a fragment of NS1 protein. Mice received three administrations of the plasmid encoding for the three viral regions and later were boosted with a single dose of the recombinant proteins GST–E and GST–NS1. As a control, two groups of mice were inoculated only with the parental plasmid or a mix of parental plasmid and both recombinant proteins. Results showed that these combinations were poor immunogenic, with low levels of neutralizing antibody response. Moreover, despite the inclusion of these viral regions, the cellular immune response was not evaluated (
