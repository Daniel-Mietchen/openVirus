<p>Several studies have also confirmed the opportunity to combine replicative immunogens in a prime-boost strategy. The first example was proposed by Blander et al. (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). In this work they evaluated the immunogenicity of a dengue vaccine candidate based on a pediatric measles vaccine expressing dengue antigens. The vaccine antigen was obtained by a fusion of DIII of the E protein and the pro-apoptotic ectodomain of M protein from DENV-1. This recombinant construct (EDIII-ectoM) was expressed in a measles vector (MV). The recombinant MV-EDIII-ectoM induced in MV-susceptible mice, a DENV-specific antibody response mainly against the EDIII-ectoM region. These antibodies were able to neutralize the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> infection produced by DENV-1. In addition, the prime immunization generated a long-term humoral immune response that was successfully boosted when animals were inoculated with a live DENV-1 strain, 9 months after. Unfortunately, the study did not evaluate the protection against DENV-1 in this mouse model (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>) and this combination has not been evaluated in non-human primates.
