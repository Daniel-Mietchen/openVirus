<p>For example, a recombinant adenovirus containing the two DIII regions from DENV-2 and DENV-4 was immunized in mice and later animals were boosted with a plasmid including the identical antigens. This prime-boost immunization strategy showed the induction of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell specific response to both DENV serotypes (

Unfortunately, this study did not evaluate the protective capacity of this combination but taking into account the immunogenicity, this could be an interesting prospect. Nevertheless, studies conducted in mice have several weaknesses and must be carefully interpreted. Further studies conducted in monkeys with this combination could demonstrate its potentiality, if a protective response is afforded.
