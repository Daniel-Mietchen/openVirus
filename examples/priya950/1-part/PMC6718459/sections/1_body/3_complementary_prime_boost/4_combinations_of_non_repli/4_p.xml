<p>In 2013, Azevedo et al. published a study evaluating the immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice of a pE1D2 DNA vaccine encodes the ectodomain of the envelope DENV2 protein fused to a signal peptide and the YF17D-D2 (constructed by replacing the prM and E genes from the 17D yellow fever vaccine virus by those from DENV-2). BALB/c mice were inoculated with these two vaccines by different prime-boost or simultaneous immunizations. Animals developed neutralizing antibodies and the combined immunization protected against a lethal dose of DENV-2, when compared to each vaccine administered alone. Results also revealed that immunization with the DNA vaccine and the combination with the chimeric virus induced a robust production of IFNÎ³ by CD8+ T lymphocytes (
