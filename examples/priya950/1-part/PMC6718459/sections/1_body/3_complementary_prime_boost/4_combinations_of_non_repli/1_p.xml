<p>Other studies have used complementary prime-boost schedules combining non-replicative immunogens and replicative live vectors. This strategy has been used to reduce the troubles associated with replicative vectors, such as the reactogenicity, the anti-vector immunity, and also to improve the immunogenicity associated with the non-replicative immunogens. With this in mind, Simmons et al. reported a study using this approach in rhesus monkeys (

The study included two experiments; firstly, authors compared the priming capacity of two tetravalent non-replicating immunogens: a tetravalent purified inactivated virus (TPIV) or a tetravalent DNA vaccine (TDNA), separated 2 months of a booster dose with a replicative tetravalent live-attenuated virus (TLAV). Eight months after the booster dose, animals were challenged with an infective strain of DENV-3. As results, all groups generated a humoral immune response against the four serotypes that was measured by ELISA and PRNT. However, complete protection (clearance of virus in sera) after viral challenge was only observed in animals immunized with the TPIV/TLAV regimen. Also, the virus challenge, increased the neutralizing antibodies titters to all serotypes in both experimental groups, but the highest anamnestic immune response was detected in the group inoculated with the TDNA/TLAV combination, where animals were also not protected. An increase of anamnestic immune response after challenge has been associated with a non-protective immune response (

In a second study, the animals were primed with one dose of TPIV and boosted with the TLAV 2 month later, and then animals were challenged with each DENV, 8 months after the last dose. The first inoculation elicited low levels of neutralizing antibodies against the four serotypes, but this response was boosted upon the second inoculation with the TLAV. However, antibodies titers waned gradually until the challenge day, in a serotype-dependent manner. Upon viral challenge, each virus entity was efficiently isolated from sera of animals inoculated with saline solution (acting as control group of the study), with mean duration of viremia of 4.5, 5.0, 4.25, and 2.75 days for DENV-1 to DENV-4, respectively. By contrast, all vaccinated animals were completely protected (
