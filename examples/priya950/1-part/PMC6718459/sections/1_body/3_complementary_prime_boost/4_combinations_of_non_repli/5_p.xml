<p>In another interesting study a VRP based on Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV), expressing prM and E proteins from DENV-1, was assayed. The VRP was tested in combination with a DNA plasmid vaccine expressing the identical DENV-1 sequence. One group of Cynomolgus macaques was vaccinated with three doses of DNA plasmid, while a second group received three doses of VRP. The third group of the study was immunized with a combination of DNA plasmid (prime) and VRP (boost), receiving two doses of DNA plasmid and a third dose of the VRP vaccine. Four weeks after the last inoculation, the group immunized with the combination produced the highest virus-binding and neutralizing antibody titters against DENV-1 compared with the other two groups evaluated. Moderate T-cell response was only measured in animals vaccinated with three doses of the DNA plasmid and in the group immunized with the combination of both antigens. When vaccinated animals were challenged with the live virus, all vaccination regimens showed significant protection from viremia, but only animals receiving the combination were completely protected (viremia mean: 0 days) (
