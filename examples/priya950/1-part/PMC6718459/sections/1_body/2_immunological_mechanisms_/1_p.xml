<p>Could a complementary prime-boost immunization strategy be more effective than a prime-boost counterpart, which uses the same antigen during the immunizations? Unfortunately, this question remains “unanswered.” However, there are several examples pointing out that the combination of different antigens can be a promising and interesting approach. Sequential immunizations with different viral vectors generate high levels of CD8+ T-cells and Th1-type CD4+ T-cells in comparison with the response achieved after the boosting with the same antigen (

In general, the selection of the best option is an empirical process, since it is not possible to evaluate all combinations, due to logistic or economic restrictions.
