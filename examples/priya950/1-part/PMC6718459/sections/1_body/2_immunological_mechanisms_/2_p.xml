<p>Some studies propose a rational view to undertaking a complementary prime-boost immunization regimen, when a DNA vaccine is used in the immunization schedule. Usually, a DNA vaccine is employed for priming while recombinant proteins or peptides, inactivated vaccines, or viral vectors are used for boosting the immune response (
