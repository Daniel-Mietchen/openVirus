<p>All licensed vaccines work mainly through the induction of antibodies, and most vaccines approved in the last years have serological markers as immune correlates measured by validated assays. The immune system is redundant and many of its components play pleiotropic functions that can contribute to the protective response against pathogens (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Antibody functions, such as neutralizing activity, cytotoxicity and opsonophagocytosis may contribute to the protection induced by vaccine candidates. Additionally, CD4+ T cells can activate B and CD8+ T cells to promote inflammation, release cytokines, and lysis infected cells, constituting another arm of the adaptive immune system to control the pathogens (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The design of the prime-boost immunization strategies will depend on the features of the disease produced by the microorganism and the adequate immune responses to fight against them. Furthermore, several questions should be considered in prime-boost immunization strategies, such as: What type of memory immune response is suitable for the pathogen (central vs. effector, systemic vs. mucosal)? Which protocol will be effective for developing this type of memory immune response? Which routes of administration, number of doses would be adequate? Unfortunately, these and other questions must be addressed during the experimentation.
