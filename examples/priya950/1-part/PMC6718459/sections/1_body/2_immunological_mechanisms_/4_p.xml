 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, for example, causes a range of diseases including gastric and duodenal ulcers, gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma. Unfortunately, none of the antibiotic treatments used by clinicians have eradicated the bacteria (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Different approaches must be evaluated and one of them can be a prime-boost immunization strategy. For example, the combination of immunodominant antigens from the bacteria with altered ligand peptides from the heat shock protein 60, an autoantigen associated with the immune-inflammation (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) provoked by the infection, can be an attractive prime-boost alternative. In addition, the combination of mucosal and parenteral immunizations (co-immunization) could be useful to induce a proper immune response and also to disrupt the bacteria-induced tolerance. Prime-boost immunization strategy could be analyzed to control the diseases produced by the list of pathogens mentioned above, although for some of them this strategy has already been evaluated (
