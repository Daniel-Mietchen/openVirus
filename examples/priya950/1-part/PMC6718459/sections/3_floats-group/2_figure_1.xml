  <p>Hypothetical prime-boost immunization regimens outcome for a dengue vaccine. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> DENV-na√Øve individual immunization with a live-attenuated vaccine will generate humoral and cellular immune responses against all the viral antigens and viremia days with likely adverse events. Boosting with Tetra DIIIC subunit vaccine will stimulate memory B and T cells specific to domain III and capsid protein. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Tetra DIIIC priming will induce humoral and cellular immune responses against domain III and capsid protein which will control LAVT-booster viremia without adverse events. LAVT, live-attenuated tetravalent vaccine; Nt Ab, neutralizing antibodies; CMI, cell-mediated immunity; DIII, domain III of DENV-envelope protein; C, DENV-capsid protein; AE, adverse events.
