<p>With the aim to investigate differences in the susceptibility of pMoDC and hMoDC to different Flaviviruses, the percentages of E protein expression were determined at 24 and 48 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). At 24 h pMoDC showed the highest susceptibility to USUV followed by JEV, WNV and SPOV, and the lowest infectivity was found with DENV-3 and ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). With hMoDC, highest susceptibilities were found with USUV and SPOV, followed by JEV, WNV, DENV-3, ZIKV, and WESSV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, for none of the viruses a statistically significant difference was found when infectivity was compared at 24 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). At 48 h, infectivity in pMoDC was significantly increased for JEV and WESSV, but decreased for USUV, DENV-3, ZIKV, and SPOV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B,E</xref>). This contrasted to hMoDC, in which for none of the viruses an increased infectivity was found. USUV and SPOV cause reduced levels of infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C,D</xref>). When the percentages of infected cells from different hosts were compared at 48 hpi, we observed species-dependent differences in the Flavivirus infectivity. JEV, WNV, and WESSV showed a higher preference for porcine cells, while ZIKV for hMoDC (
