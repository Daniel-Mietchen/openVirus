<p>Titrations of the supernatants from the experiments shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> collected at 24 hpi, demonstrated that in pMoDC JEV and SPOV replicated to the highest titers, followed by WESSV, WNV, ZIKV, USUV, and finally DENV-3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In hMoDC at 24 h, high titers were found for JEV, WNV, USUV followed by SPOV, WESSV, ZIKV, and DENV-3 having again the lowest titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Species comparison at 24 h revealed higher titers of USUV but significantly lower levels of DENV-3, ZIKV, and SPOV when comparing hMoDC to pMoDC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). At 48 hpi in pMoDC, virus titers remained without significant changes with the exception of decreasing DENV-3 titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B,E</xref>). For hMoDC we found an increase for ZIKV and WESSV titers over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D,F</xref>). The species comparison of viral titers at 48 hpi revealed that again USUV had a clear advantage for replication in hMoDC. Surprisingly, SPOV and ZIKV better replicated in porcine cells (
