<p>Considering the importance of pigs for livestock in many parts of the world and its known role as amplifying host for JEV, we decided to investigate if and how porcine MoDC differ from their human counterparts in their interaction with a collection of Flaviviruses. Our aim was on one side to evaluate how well the MoDC culture model can reflect species tropism of flaviviruses, and on the other side to identify differences between Flaviviruses in infection, replication and innate immune responses. To this end, we selected viruses that have caused recent epidemics including JEV, WNV, USUV, DENV, and ZIKV. We also included Spondweni virus (SPOV) and Wesselsbron virus (WESSV), both currently circulating only in Sub-Saharan countries. SPOV was included as a virus being closely related to ZIKV, and WESSV as a virus having a tropism for domestic animals, in particular ruminants (Hubalek et al.,
