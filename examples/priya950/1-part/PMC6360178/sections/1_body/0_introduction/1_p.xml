<p>Within the genus of Flavivirus more than 60 species are described, which are mostly transmitted by arthropods to vertebrates. 50% of these virus species are mosquito-born, 28% are transmitted by ticks, and for the rest the vector is unknown (Simmonds et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Some Flaviviruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infect a broad range of vertebrate hosts varying from amphibians, to birds and various mammals, while others have restricted host affinity, such as Dengue virus (DENV) only known to infect primates (Go et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Simmonds et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The majority of Flaviviruses are kept in enzootic cycles between hematophagous arthropods and vertebrates, vectors, which are infected during the blood sucking on viremic hosts. More than half of the described Flaviviruses cause zoonotic diseases, ranging from febrile illness, to encephalitis-related disease or life-threatening hemorrhagic fever (Borio et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Weissenb√∂ck et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Go et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gould et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The fact that several Flaviviruses have recently emerged, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas, and WNV and Usutu virus (USUV) in Europe represents a serious warning that the current distribution of Flaviviruses could expand in the near future (Gould et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The recent identification of human cases of DENV after local transmission in different countries of Europe (France and Spain) highlights the risk of the introduction of new Flaviviruses where competent mosquito vectors are present, such as 
 <italic>Aedes (A.) albopictus</italic>. It is important to note that none of the recent Flavivirus outbreaks have been predicted and that factors contributing to emergences are not well understood. For many of the less studied Flaviviruses the potential contribution of various vertebrate species to the maintenance of the virus is incompletely understood (Go et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In particular, the susceptibility of animals living in close proximity to man such as domestic animals and livestock are important.
