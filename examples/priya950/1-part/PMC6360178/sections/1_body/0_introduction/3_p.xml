<p>For such 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, the present work employed monocyte-derived dendritic cell (MoDC). This was based on the rational that these and related cells are present at the site of entry in the skin, where they are believed to support the virus replication of several Flaviviruses early after infection, and participate in early innate immune responses (Wu et al.,

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Schmid and Harris,

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Vielle et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). MoDC cells can be generated from any species if sufficient numbers of blood monocytes can be obtained and recombinant cytokines are available. Another major advantage is that with animals of sufficient size blood sampling does not require killing. Furthermore, during infection-caused skin inflammation monocytes will be attracted and differentiate into both MoDC and monocyte-derived macrophages (Tamoutounour et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which are likely to be involved in innate immune responses against arboviruses as demonstrated for DENV (Schmid and Harris, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Schmid et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
