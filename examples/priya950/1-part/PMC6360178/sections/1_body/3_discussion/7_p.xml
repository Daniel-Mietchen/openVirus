<p>A considerable broad range of hosts have been described for WESSV, including human, sheep, goat, cattle, pigs, dogs, rats, and other wild life species (Coetzer and Barnard,

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, in neither human nor porcine MoDC we found high levels of infected cells but relatively good viral titers in the supernatants of the cell cultures, without evidence for induction of innate immune responses.
