<p>For WNV we found that despite of low numbers of WNV-infected pMoDC, the virus efficiently replicated. Although some 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments suggest that pigs would not play an important role as amplifying host for WNV (Ilkal et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Teehee et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), a seroconversion of pigs has been demonstrated in about of 22.5% of tested serum samples from feral pigs in the US, in 17.6% of wild boars in Europe and in 15.5% of farmed pigs also in Europe (Gibbs et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Escribano-Romero et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This clearly demonstrated that pigs are susceptible to WNV and a role of this species in the epidemiology cannot be excluded. Interestingly, our study showed that WNV infected and replicated to high titers in hMoDC without inducing early innate cytokine responses. These results which support previously published data (Rawle et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) could indicate that WNV has undergone a certain degree of adaptation to human cells.
