<p>During the last two decades, since USUV emerged in Europe, several outbreaks occurred affecting wild and domestic birds (Weissenböck et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Hubalek et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>; Grottola et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Michel et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results demonstrate that although at 24 h many pMoDC are infected by USUV, the infection rate drops strongly at 48 h and gives rise only to relatively low viral titers. This is associated with high IFN-β and TNF responses, possibly indicating a poor adaptation of this virus to the pig. This would be in line with surveillance data for WNV and USUV. Although antibodies against both viruses were found in wild boars, in domestic pigs only WNV-specific antibodies were detected (Escribano-Romero et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, it is not known if wild boars differ from domestic pigs in their susceptibility to USUV. hMoDC were also highly susceptible to USUV but replicated to higher titers when compared to pMoDC. Nevertheless, similar to another report (Cacciotti et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), also in hMoDC high IFN-β and TNF responses were found which would be expected to limit virus spread 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Field data demonstrate that humans are infected by USUV in endemic areas, although only in rare cases with severe clinical symptoms or even fatal outcome (Pecorari et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Santini et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Grottola et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
