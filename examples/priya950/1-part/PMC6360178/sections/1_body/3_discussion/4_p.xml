<p>The present study showed that pMoDC are resistant to infection by DENV-3, which is likely to be responsible for the lack of innate immune responses in pMoDC. These results are in line with previous field observations, supporting that DENV vertebrate hosts are mainly restricted to primates (Chen and Vasilakis, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Nevertheless, some authors suggested that other vertebrates could be hosts for DENV in the rainforest, or that pigs could be used as an animal model (de Thoisy et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Cassetti et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). With human cells, we observed a low susceptibility to infection by DENV-3, and an overall inefficient virus replication. This could be related to the strain used as previous reports indicate highly variable levels of infection which may depend on the serotype and virulence (Navarro-Sanchez et al.,
