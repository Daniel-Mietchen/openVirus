<p>Although SPOV is genetically closely related to ZIKV (Haddow et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), pMoDC were more susceptible to the infection by SPOV than ZIKV and the virus efficiently replicated in swine cells. The infection caused high amounts of IFN-β and TNF, possibly limiting prolonged virus infection. With respect to possible hosts that could maintain or amplify SPOV in the wildlife, previous reports demonstrated that neither birds nor rodents seem to act as reservoir for the virus, and experimental studies suggest non-human primates as possible target for the virus (Haddow et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Our results suggest that serological field data from endemic areas should be performed to address a possible role of pigs in the viral life cycle. In hMoDC, SPOV showed comparable characteristics in terms of its efficient replication and the lack of IFN-β and TNF induction.
