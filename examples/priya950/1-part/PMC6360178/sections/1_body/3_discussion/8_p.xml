<p>Another potentially interesting readout was virus induced cell death, which correlated well with the levels of infected cells, indicating a direct viral cytopathogenic effect. Nevertheless, we also found a high correlation of cell death with IFN-Î² and TNF responses. This may indicate that host response to infection may contribute to cell death.</p>
