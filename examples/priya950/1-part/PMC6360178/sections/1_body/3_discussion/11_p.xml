<p>When interpreting the results of the present work, it is important to note that for logistic reasons we were only able to include one strain for each virus species, and extrapolations to all viruses from the studied species should be done with care as strain differences can be important as mentioned above for DENV. Furthermore, in most cases it is impossible to directly correlate our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental data. These of course are completely lacking for humans and are only partially available for pigs. Nevertheless, altogether some clear differences in Flavivirus-MoDC interactions were identified 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that such data can give valuable information on virus-host interactions. These can model certain aspects of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> infection, and can help to evaluate differences in innate immune responses against Flaviviruses. In this context, the biggest surprise was the high level of infection and replication of USUV in hMoDC, which may be interpreted as a warning concerning the zoonotic potential of USUV.
