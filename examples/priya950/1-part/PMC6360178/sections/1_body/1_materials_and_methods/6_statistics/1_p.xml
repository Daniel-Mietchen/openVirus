<p>Figures and data analyses employed GraphPad Prism 7 Software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). All experiments were independently performed between 3 and 9 times with cells from different donors, and each condition in triplicates. For viral titrations, differences between groups were assessed using a Kruskal–Wallis test, and for individual differences the Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>-test with Bonferroni correction as 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> was employed. For group differences in the percentages of infected cells and levels of cytokines expression comparisons, we employed a one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction as 
 <italic>post hoc</italic>. Correlation analysis between infected cells, dead MoDC, viral titers, and expressed cytokines were calculated by Spearman's Rho analysis; a correlation between two different factors was considered relevant with R
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.5. For all data a 
 <italic>p</italic> value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In the Figures

 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05,
