<p>The porcine TNF and IL-1β, and the human TNF, IL-1β, and IFN-β expressions were quantified using commercial kits (R&amp;D Systems, UK), with detection limits of 30 pg/ml for porcine and human TNF kit, 60 or 4 pg/ml for the porcine or human IL-1β ELISA, respectively, and 10 pg/ml for the human IFN-β test. Porcine IFN-β production was measured with reagents from Kingfisher with all incubations done at room temperature. Briefly, the polyclonal capture antibody against porcine IFN-β was diluted at 1 μg/ml to coat ELISA plates overnight at room temperature, then blocked with 4% FBS in PBS (also used as diluent for the other ELISA components) for 2 h. Samples (1:1 in diluent) and standards (2-fold-dilutions from 500 to 2 pg/ml of provided porcine IFN-β) were added at a final volume of 100 μl/well and incubated for another 2 h. After washing, the biotinylated detection antibody (0.5 μg/ml) was added for 2 h followed by Streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase (DAKO) for 30 min, and the final addition of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Dako) for the colorimetric reaction. After 30 min incubation in the dark, the reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 0.18 M sulfuric acid solution and absorbance was measured at 450 nm.</p>
