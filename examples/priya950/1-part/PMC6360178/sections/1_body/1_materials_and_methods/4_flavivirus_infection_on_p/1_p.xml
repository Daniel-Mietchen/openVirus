<p>Porcine MoDC and hMoDC were incubated for 1.5 h at 39 or 37°C (for pMoDC or hMoDC, respectively) in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> with the virus preparations at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per cell. Then, the cells were washed 3 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and fresh medium supplemented with 2% FBS and cytokines as described above were added to the cells. After 24 and 48 h post infection (hpi), supernatants were harvested and stored at −80°C. MoDC were harvested as cell suspensions with cold PBS/5xEDTA and fixed with 4% (

 <italic>w/v</italic>) saponin, and immunolabelled with mAb 4G2 in 0.3% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) saponin in PBS during 15 min on ice. After washing the cells with 0.1% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) saponin in PBS, anti-mouse IgG2a conjugated with Alexa 647 fluorochrome (ThermoFisher) was added for 10 min on ice. The cells were acquired on a FACSCantoII (Becton Dickinson) and results analyzed with Flowjo V.9.1 software (Treestar, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). For analyses doublets and cells with low forward/side scatter corresponding to debris and dead MoDC were excluded by electronic gating. For the quantification of dead cells in the cultures we also employed FSC/SSC gating previously shown to correspond to dead MoDC detected by propidium iodide staining (Garcia-Nicolas et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Viral titers were determined in C6/36 cells for JEV, WNV, USUV, ZIKV, DENV, SPOV, and WESSV using IPMA as described above.
