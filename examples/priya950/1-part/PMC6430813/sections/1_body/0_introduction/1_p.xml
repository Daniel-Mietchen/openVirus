<p id="Par3">Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>. Both 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> are the primary vectors for ZIKV transmission in nature

 </sup>. After transmission by infected mosquitoes feeding on naive hosts, ZIKV rapidly develops viremia, which enables acquisition by other mosquitoes via a blood meal. The virus subsequently infects the midgut epithelial cells and systemically invades other tissues, such as the salivary glands. Consequently, the infected mosquitoes transmit the virus to another host through blood feeding. In addition to causing viremia in host blood, ZIKV has also been isolated from host semen, urine, saliva, amniotic fluid, breast milk, and cerebrospinal fluid
