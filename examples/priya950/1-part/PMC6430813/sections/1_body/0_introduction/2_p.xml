 </sup>. In addition, ZIKV viruria may persist for several days. The equivalent of 12–20 pfu/ml ZIKV was present in urine samples from three patients from 5 to 26 days after the onset of Zika symptoms

 </sup>. Indeed, an adult may urinate 1000–2000 ml daily and, if infected by ZIKV, discharge infectious ZIKV into the environment, including sewers, water pools, septic tanks, or other artificial containers around human dwellings. In a disease-outbreak scenario, many infected individuals (with or without symptoms) may intensively discharge a large volume of infectious urine into a restricted aquatic habitat of mosquitoes. We therefore investigated whether the urine from Zika patients could be a ZIKV source that facilitates mosquito infection in aquatic stages, and thus enables viral transmission.
