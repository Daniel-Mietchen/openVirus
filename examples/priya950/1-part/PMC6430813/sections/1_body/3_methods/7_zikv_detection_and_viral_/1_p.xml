<p id="Par27">The freshly emerging pupae of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> were reared in ZIKV urine. The freshly emerging pupae of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> were reared in either human urine or sewage with ZIKV urine. Eight days after emerging, ten adult mosquitoes were pooled and ground in 400 µl PBS buffer (C10010500, Gibco). The homogenized mosquitoes were then centrifuged at 20,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then filtered by a 0.22 µm filtration unit (SLGV013SL, Millipore) for culturing in Vero cells. Total RNA was isolated from the infectious supernatant of Vero cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (74106, Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (170-8890, Bio-Rad). We amplified ZIKV fragments by PCR. The PCR products were subjected to viral sequencing. The sequencing primers are shown in Supplementary Table
