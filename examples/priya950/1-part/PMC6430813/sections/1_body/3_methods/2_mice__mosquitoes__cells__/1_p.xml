<p id="Par22">C57BL/6 mice deficient in type I and II IFN receptors (AG6 mouse) were donated by the Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The mice were bred and maintained in a specific pathogen-free animal facility at Tsinghua University. All animal protocols used in this study were approved by the IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) of Tsinghua University and performed in accordance with the IACUC guidelines. The laboratory animal facility is accredited by the AAALAC (Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International). Groups of age- and sex-matched AG6 mice, 6–8 weeks of age, were used for the animal study. The

 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> Jiangsu strain, the 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Brazil Paraiba strain, and the 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> Hainan strain were reared in a low-temperature, illuminated incubator (Model 818, Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) at 28 °C and 80% humidity according to standard rearing procedures

 </sup>. The Vero cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, C11965500BT, Gibco), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (16000-044, Gibco). The Vero cell line was purchased from ATCC (CCL­81). The cell lines had no mycoplasma contamination. All of the viruses were titrated by a plaque assay

 </sup>. Briefly, the titrated samples were added to 95–100% confluent Vero cells in 6-well plates, and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 4 h. The wells were washed with PBS, and subsequently overlaid with 2.5 ml of DMEM-agarose. After 5–6 days, the cells were stained with 1% crystal violet. The plaques were counted for viral particle calculation.
