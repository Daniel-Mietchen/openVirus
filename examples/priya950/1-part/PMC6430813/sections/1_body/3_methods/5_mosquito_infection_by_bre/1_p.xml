<p id="Par25">Fresh human urine from Donor 3 was mixed with ZIKV supernatant from infected Vero cells. The mixture is named ZIKV urine hereafter. ZIKV urine was used for breeding the pupae of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (Rockefeller strain, Brazil Paraiba strain) and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> (Jiangsu strain). After exposure to ZIKV urine, the larvae or pupae were transferred to a container with fresh water until eclosion. The emerging mosquitoes were reared for an additional 8 days for viral detection.
