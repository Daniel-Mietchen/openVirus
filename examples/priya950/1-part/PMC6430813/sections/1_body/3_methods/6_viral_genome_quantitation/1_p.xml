<p id="Par26">Total RNA was isolated from homogenized mosquitoes using an RNeasy Mini Kit (74106, Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (170-8890, Bio-Rad). Viral genomes were quantified via qPCR amplification of ZIKV, DENV, BATV, and SINV genes. The viral genomic copies were normalized by a standard curve
