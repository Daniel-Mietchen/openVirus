<p id="Par29">The pupae of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (Rockefeller strain) and 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (Brazil Paraiba strain) bred in ZIKV urine. Eight days after adult mosquitoes emerged, 20 emerged female mosquitoes were separated into a netting-covered container for blood feeding. The mosquitoes were starved for 24 h before blood engorgement. Six- to eight-week-old AG6 mice were anesthetized and placed on the top of the containers. The mosquitoes were allowed to feed on the mice for 30 min in darkness. The blood samples were collected daily from the tail veins of AG6 mice, and the viral genome was quantified via TaqMan qPCR amplification of the ZIKV 
 <italic>E</italic> gene. The number of infectious ZIKV particles in plasma at the viremic period was determined by a plaque assay.
