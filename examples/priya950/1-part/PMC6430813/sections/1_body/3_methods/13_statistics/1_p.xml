<p id="Par33">Animals were randomly allocated to different groups. Mosquitoes that died before measurement were excluded from the analysis. The investigators were not blinded to the allocation during the experiments or to the outcome assessment. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. Descriptive statistics are provided in the figure legends. A Kruskalâ€“Wallis analysis of variance was conducted to detect any significant variation among replicates. If no significant variation was detected, the results were pooled for further comparison. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between ZIKV survivability and the urine pH value in human urine. All analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism statistical software.</p>
