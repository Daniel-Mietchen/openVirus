<p id="Par28">Human urine (Donor #3) with 20 pfu/ml ZIKV (PRVABC59 strain) was added to the sewage (Sample #5) or PBS, as a mock control, at either 1:10 or 1:100 dilutions. Urine with 20 pfu/ml ZIKV was continuously supplemented into sewage or PBS at 3-h intervals. The infectious sewage or PBS was incubated at 28 °C. Viral survivability was determined at 1 h post ZIKV supplementation via a plaque assay. Briefly, the infectious sewage was filtered by a 0.22 µm filtration unit (SLGV013SL, Millipore) to remove bacterial contamination. We next used 5 ml of filtered infectious sewage to add into a well of 6-well plate for a plaque assay. After 4 h of incubation with Vero cells, the infectious sewage samples were removed and replaced with 2% DMEM (containing 1% agarose) for 5 days. The sample was measured twice.</p>
