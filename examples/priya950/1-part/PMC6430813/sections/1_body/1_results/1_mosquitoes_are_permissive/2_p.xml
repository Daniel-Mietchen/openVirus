<p id="Par7">We next investigated whether the mosquitoes that breed in infectious urine might acquire ZIKV. We first assessed the susceptibility of larval and pupal stages to ZIKV infection in aquatic conditions. The fresh urine from Donor 3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) was mixed with ZIKV supernatant from infected Vero cells for 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> larvae and pupae breeding (PRVABC59 strain, final titer was 20 pfu/ml). After exposure to ZIKV urine, the larvae or pupae were transferred to a new container with fresh water until eclosion (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). The emerging adult mosquitoes were reared for 8 days for ZIKV detection by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Intriguingly, both the larvae and pupae in the ZIKV urine were permissive to ZIKV infection and carried ZIKV throughout development to adults (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). Notably, the mosquitoes emerging from pupae incubation presented the highest prevalence of ZIKV infection, suggesting that the pupae might be more susceptible to ZIKV in urine.
