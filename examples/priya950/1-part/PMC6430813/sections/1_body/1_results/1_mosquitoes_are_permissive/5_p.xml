<p id="Par10">We next assessed this transmission route for other arboviruses. In contrast to ZIKV, Dengue virus 2 (DENV2) rapidly lost its infectivity in fresh human urine at 37 °C (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). A previous study reported the existence of DENV2 RNA in urine discharged from a patient with dengue fever

 </sup>. Intriguingly, 2 of 109 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (the Rockefeller strain) acquired DENV2 infection during pupae breeding (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). We tried to isolate infective DENV virions from mosquitoes breeding in urine containing DENV2 using the same experimental procedure as in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. However, no positive samples were identified from 50 mosquito pools (10 mosquitoes per pool). In addition, both the Batai virus (BATV, 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>) and Sindbis virus (SINV, 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>) showed stable infectivity after 8 h of incubation at 37 °C (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c, e</xref>). However, the 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes, which emerged from pupae, failed to acquire BATV or SINV from the urine (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3d, f</xref>).
