 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> tend to oviposit and breed in wastewater with low dissolved oxygen and high turbidity, such as cesspits, septic tanks, and sewers (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Notably, immature forms of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> have been widely found in raw sewage during dengue epidemics in Brazil

 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes emerging from wastewater may be equal or even larger than those from traditional breeding sites (clean water) in Brazil

 </sup>. We therefore wondered whether mosquitoes might acquire ZIKV while breeding in aquatic conditions with human urine containing infectious ZIKV. We first assessed ZIKV stability in human urine. To mimic the conditions in the human bladder, we incubated ZIKV with eight fresh human urine samples (PRVABC59 strain, final titer was 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu/ml) and incubated ZIKV with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control. The mixture was then maintained at 37 °C (human physiological temperature) for 48 h. Interestingly, ZIKV survivability varied significantly between individual urine samples. A titer of ZIKV (&gt;10
 <sup>2</sup> pfu/ml) was detected in two samples at 24 h at 37 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). To mimic the natural post-excretion conditions, we incubated ZIKV with the same eight fresh human urine samples (PRVABC59 strain, final titer was 20 pfu/ml). Incubation of ZIKV with PBS served as a control. The mixture was then maintained at 28 °C for 48 h. A titer of ZIKV was detected in one sample at 24 h at 28 °C using a plaque assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This result suggests that the extended stability of ZIKV in human urine in the environment may provide a time window for ZIKV infection during mosquito breeding.
