<p id="Par16">We next exploited the AG6 mouse model and 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> to investigate whether ZIKV-contaminated urine could infect breeding mosquitoes. The pH in human urine varies from 4.5 to 8.0; however, mouse urine is usually more acidic, with a pH lower than 6.5

 </sup>. ZIKV could not maintain its infectivity in regular mouse urine (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). However, after the pH value was adjusted to &gt;6.5, the mouse urine was able to maintain ZIKV infectivity (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Next, we infected the AG6 mice with ZIKV via intraperitoneal injection (100 pfu per mouse) and subsequently treated the infected mice daily with NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The AG6 mice developed high viremia after infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Consistent with the previous literature, NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> treatment significantly elevated the pH value of the mouse urine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The urine pH of the NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>-treated mice started to decrease 3 days after infection, likely due to severe morbidity of the infected animals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Notably, there were almost no infectious ZIKV particles in the urine of untreated infected mice; however, 30–120 pfu/ml infectious ZIKV was observed in the urine of NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>-treated mice from days 3 to 6 post infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). The 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> pupae were then bred in 5-fold diluted urine excreted by ZIKV-infected mice. The adult mosquitoes from pupae in the infected mouse urine were reared for an additional 8 days for RT-qPCR detection of viral loads. We found that 1.1–5.0% of the mosquitoes were positive for ZIKV RNA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>), demonstrating that ZIKV was transmitted from animals to mosquitoes via urine. These results indicate that ZIKV might transmit between the mosquitoes emerging from a ZIKV urine-contaminated water source and humans (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>).
