<p id="Par20">ZIKV is well known to maintain a transmission cycle between its hosts and mosquitoes primarily through mosquito blood-feeding behavior. We report here that mosquitoes breeding from a water system contaminated by ZIKV-containing human urine can carry and transmit ZIKV. Our study suggests that mosquitoes might acquire ZIKV not only through feeding on a viremic host

 </sup> but also through urine excreted by ZIKV patients. In addition to ZIKV, the RNA of other flaviviruses, such as DENV

 </sup>, and West Nile viruses (WNV)

 </sup> have also been found in infected human urine. The presence of infectious particles has been detected in the urine of WNV patients

 </sup>, suggesting that other flaviviruses in human urine might also be transmissible. The mosquito-borne flaviviral diseases widely occur in the tropical and subtropical regions of developing countries with a rudimentary sewer system and poor basic sanitation conditions
