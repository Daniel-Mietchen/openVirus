Both <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> are the primary vectors for ZIKV transmission in nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Recent ZIKV epidemics in the Americas resulted in more than 223,000 confirmed cases until the end of 2017<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Several neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and microcephaly in neonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, are associated with ZIKV infection. As a mosquito-borne flavivirus, ZIKV is well known to survive in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. After transmission by infected mosquitoes feeding on naive hosts, ZIKV rapidly develops viremia, which enables acquisition by other mosquitoes via a blood meal. The virus subsequently infects the midgut epithelial cells and systemically invades other tissues, such as the salivary glands. Consequently, the infected mosquitoes transmit the virus to another host through blood feeding. In addition to causing viremia in host blood, ZIKV has also been isolated from host semen, urine, saliva, amniotic fluid, breast milk, and cerebrospinal fluid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Transmission of ZIKV has also been suggested to occur via other nonvector approaches, such as sexual, congenital transmission, and blood transfusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Accumulating evidence indicates that infectious ZIKV particles are excreted into urine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. To date, at least five ZIKV infectious strains have been recovered and cultured from human urine samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, demonstrating that infectious ZIKV is discharged by patient viruria. Another study reports an infectious ZIKV titer of 10&#x02009;pfu/ml in the urine of a patient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, ZIKV viruria may persist for several days. The equivalent of 12&#x02013;20&#x02009;pfu/ml ZIKV was present in urine samples from three patients from 5 to 26 days after the onset of Zika symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, an adult may urinate 1000&#x02013;2000&#x02009;ml daily and, if infected by ZIKV, discharge infectious ZIKV into the environment, including sewers, water pools, septic tanks, or other artificial containers around human dwellings. In a disease-outbreak scenario, many infected individuals (with or without symptoms) may intensively discharge a large volume of infectious urine into a restricted aquatic habitat of mosquitoes. We therefore investigated whether the urine from Zika patients could be a ZIKV source that facilitates mosquito infection in aquatic stages, and thus enables viral transmission.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we demonstrate that both <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and <italic>A. albopictus</italic> are permissive to ZIKV infection when breeding in urine or sewage containing low concentrations of ZIKV.

Furthermore, female field <italic>A. aegypti</italic> breeding in infectious sewage can transmit infectious Zika virions to naive AG6 mice, suggesting that ZIKV in contaminated aquatic environments is transmissible by mosquitoes during breeding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mosquitoes are permissive to ZIKV infection when breeding</title><p id="Par6">Both <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, which live around human dwellings, are major vectors for ZIKV transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These <italic>Aedes</italic> species commonly breed in containers with clean water such as tree holes, flower pots, and tires. However, accumulating evidence from field surveillance convincingly shows that <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and <italic>A. albopictus</italic> tend to oviposit and breed in wastewater with low dissolved oxygen and high turbidity, such as cesspits, septic tanks, and sewers (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Notably, immature forms of <italic>A. aegypti</italic> have been widely found in raw sewage during dengue epidemics in Brazil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The population of adult <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes emerging from wastewater may be equal or even larger than those from traditional breeding sites (clean water) in Brazil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and Puerto Rico<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We therefore wondered whether mosquitoes might acquire ZIKV while breeding in aquatic conditions with human urine containing infectious ZIKV. We first assessed ZIKV stability in human urine. To mimic the conditions in the human bladder, we incubated ZIKV with eight fresh human urine samples (PRVABC59 strain, final titer was 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;pfu/ml) and incubated ZIKV with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control. The mixture was then maintained at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (human physiological temperature) for 48&#x02009;h. Interestingly, ZIKV survivability varied significantly between individual urine samples. A titer of ZIKV (&#x0003e;10<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;pfu/ml) was detected in two samples at 24&#x02009;h at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). To mimic the natural post-excretion conditions, we incubated ZIKV with the same eight fresh human urine samples (PRVABC59 strain, final titer was 20&#x02009;pfu/ml). Incubation of ZIKV with PBS served as a control. The mixture was then maintained at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 48&#x02009;h. A titer of ZIKV was detected in one sample at 24&#x02009;h at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C using a plaque assay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This result suggests that the extended stability of ZIKV in human urine in the environment may provide a time window for ZIKV infection during mosquito breeding.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mosquitoes are permissive to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during breeding. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> ZIKV survivability in human urine.

We first assessed the susceptibility of larval and pupal stages to ZIKV infection in aquatic conditions.

After exposure to ZIKV urine, the larvae or pupae were transferred to a new container with fresh water until eclosion (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). The emerging adult mosquitoes were reared for 8 days for ZIKV detection by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Intriguingly, both the larvae and pupae in the ZIKV urine were permissive to ZIKV infection and carried ZIKV throughout development to adults (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). Notably, the mosquitoes emerging from pupae incubation presented the highest prevalence of ZIKV infection, suggesting that the pupae might be more susceptible to ZIKV in urine.</p><p id="Par8">Both <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and <italic>A. albopictus</italic> have been shown to carry and transmit ZIKV in several field surveillance reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. We next investigated whether the different mosquito species breeding in human urine with ZIKV might acquire an infection. In the first experiment, we incubated the pupae of either <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (Rockefeller strain) or <italic>A. albopictus</italic> (Jiangsu strain) with the ZIKV-positive urine, in which the final ZIKV titers were 20, 2, and 0.2&#x02009;pfu/ml (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The pupae of the two mosquito species emerged in human urine (Donor 3) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). The adult mosquitoes were reared for 8 days and subjected to ZIKV detection by RT-qPCR. For the <italic>A. aegypti</italic> Rockefeller strain, 3.7% (8/215) and 2.7% (4/147) of mosquitoes in the adult stage, breeding in 20 and 2&#x02009;pfu/ml ZIKV urine, respectively, were positive for ZIKV by RT-qPCR detection. However, none of the mosquitoes (0/129) acquired the infection from human urine with 0.2&#x02009;pfu/ml ZIKV (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).

Therefore, we propose that it is impractical to collect sewage samples from epidemic areas for the detection of infectious ZIKV. As an alternative, we collected 10 sewage samples from different cesspit locations. The characteristics of these sewage samples are shown in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. The pH values of these sewages ranged from 7.45 to 8.35; the chemical oxygen demand (COD) largely varied from 80 to 2300&#x02009;mg/l; and the amount of ammonia nitrogen (NH<sub>3</sub>-N) ranged from 25 to 430&#x02009;mg/l (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Subsequently, we tested the viral survivability in these sewage samples. The viral survivability in the samples was measured by a time-course plaque assay.

The virus survived up to 192&#x02009;h in the rest of the samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

Next, we infected the AG6 mice with ZIKV via intraperitoneal injection (100&#x02009;pfu per mouse) and subsequently treated the infected mice daily with NaHCO<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The AG6 mice developed high viremia after infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).

The urine pH of the NaHCO<sub>3</sub>-treated mice started to decrease 3 days after infection, likely due to severe morbidity of the infected animals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Notably, there were almost no infectious ZIKV particles in the urine of untreated infected mice; however, 30&#x02013;120&#x02009;pfu/ml infectious ZIKV was observed in the urine of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>-treated mice from days 3 to 6 post infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).

Although mosquitoes transmit ZIKV to and acquire it from humans primarily through blood feeding, our experiments mimicking natural settings demonstrate that mosquitoes may acquire ZIKV from human urinal discharge and sewage during breeding. Our conclusions are supported by several lines of laboratory evidence. First, ZIKV may survive for up to 8&#x02009;h in harsh environments, such as urinal discharge and sewage. Second, both lab-adapted and field mosquitoes were infected during hatching by ZIKV in the urinal and sewage environments at concentrations as low as 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;pfu/ml. Third, the adult mosquitoes that hatched from ZIKV urine/sewage were capable of transmitting ZIKV to mice and eliciting viremia. In favor of our laboratory findings, recent clinical studies have shown the presence of 10&#x02013;20 infectious ZIKV particles per ml of ZIKV patient urine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In particular, cesspits are still commonly used in areas with recent ZIKV epidemics, including Brazil and the Pacific islands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Poor public sanitary infrastructure may have created a physical environment for urinal ZIKV to be acquired by mosquitoes. Nonetheless, these experimental studies attempting to mimic natural settings cannot fully represent the natural scenarios in the field. The potential limitations in experimental design, such as the number of urine and sewage samples, the experimental parameter settings (temperature, incubation time, etc.), and usage of animal models (mosquito species/strains, mouse models, etc.), suggest that the laboratory conditions may not comprehensively represent realistic conditions. Epidemiological studies will be needed to prove human viruria-mediated ZIKV infection in mosquitoes.</p><p id="Par18">Our current result indicates that the maintenance of a low ZIKV titer in sewage can cause the infection of adult mosquitoes through breeding. The infected mosquitoes derived from the infectious sewage can transmit ZIKV to a host by biting. In a disease-outbreak scenario, many infected individuals (with or without symptoms) may intensively discharge a large volume of infectious urine into a restricted aquatic habitat of mosquitoes. We therefore speculate a scenario during a Zika outbreak in which the accumulating ZIKV infectious particles discharged by patients might be sufficient to facilitate the acquisition of an infection by immature mosquitoes breeding in cesspit conditions, thereby establishing the host urination-mosquito breeding transmission cycle. Interestingly, the emerging evidence indicates that low-passage <italic>Aedes</italic> field mosquitoes from the Americas have an unexpectedly low vector competence for ZIKV transmission by oral blood feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Compared to that of CHIKV and DENV, clinical surveillance has shown a relatively low ZIKV viremia (10<sup>2</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>3</sup>&#x02009;pfu/ml) present in human serum samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, the acquisition of human blood with 10<sup>3</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>4</sup>&#x02009;pfu/ml ZIKV resulted in an inefficient infection and transmission by both the lab-adapted and field-derived <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Thus, ZIKV viremia alone might not account for its rapid spread, implicating that additional routes might contribute to the prevalence of mosquito infection in nature. Nonetheless, human viremia titers reported in the previous literature may reflect snapshot results of patients seeking treatment after symptom onset. It is possible that these results may actually reflect off-peak viremia.</p><p id="Par19">A common concept is that <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes mainly breed in clean water. However, accumulating evidence indicates that both <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and <italic>A. albopictus</italic> have evolved to oviposit and breed in wastewater with low oxygen and high turbidity. Notably, the population of adult <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes emerging from sewage may be equal to or even larger than those emerging from traditional breeding sites (clean water) in Brazil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and Puerto Rico<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the epidemiological importance of cesspit breeding for ZIKV transmission remains unclear. Further field surveillance is therefore needed to investigate the breeding behavior of these <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. in cesspit conditions. In this study, we selected 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C as a temperature parameter in our laboratory setting to mimic the natural conditions. Indeed, the mosquitoes maintained in the laboratory were routinely reared at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C as a standard condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

We noted that the temperature setting at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C might represent a realistic daytime condition in the ZIKV epidemic area. Nonetheless, nighttime temperatures are also essential for mosquito breeding and are likely to be substantially lower. Therefore, both mosquito breeding and ZIKV stability under various temperature conditions remain to be further investigated.</p><p id="Par20">ZIKV is well known to maintain a transmission cycle between its hosts and mosquitoes primarily through mosquito blood-feeding behavior. We report here that mosquitoes breeding from a water system contaminated by ZIKV-containing human urine can carry and transmit ZIKV. Our study suggests that mosquitoes might acquire ZIKV not only through feeding on a viremic host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> but also through urine excreted by ZIKV patients. In addition to ZIKV, the RNA of other flaviviruses, such as DENV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, yellow fever virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, and West Nile viruses (WNV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> have also been found in infected human urine. The presence of infectious particles has been detected in the urine of WNV patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, suggesting that other flaviviruses in human urine might also be transmissible.
