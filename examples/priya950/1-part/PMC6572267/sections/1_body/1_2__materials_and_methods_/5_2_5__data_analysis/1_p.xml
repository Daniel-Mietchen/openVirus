<p>All statistical analyses were performed using Prism (Graphpad Version 7.04, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The rate of infection per species in each collection area was calculated by dividing the number of positive mosquitoes by the total number of mosquitoes of the same species collected in the same area. Total infection rate per species was calculated by dividing the number of infected specimens of a species by the total number of specimens of that species.</p>
