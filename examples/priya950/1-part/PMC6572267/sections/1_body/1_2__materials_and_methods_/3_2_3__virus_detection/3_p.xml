<p>Multiplex reactions targeted YFV, CHIKV and DENV in the first reaction, and ZIKV and MAYV in the second reaction, and were performed using a Lightcycler96 real-time PCR machine (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) with the following standard cycling conditions: reverse transcription at 45 °C for 15 min, reverse transcriptase inactivation and Gotaq
 <sup>®</sup> DNA Polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) activation at 95 °C for 2 min and initial denaturation annealing and extension for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s followed by 60 °C for 1 min. The reaction volume was 10 μL: 2× RT-PCR Reaction Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), RT-enzyme solution (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 1 μM YFV primer (For + Rev) (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA), 0.2 μM YFV probe (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA), 0.5 μM other primers (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) and 0.1 μM other probes (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). A fraction (1/40) of the total isolated RNA was used in the reactions.
