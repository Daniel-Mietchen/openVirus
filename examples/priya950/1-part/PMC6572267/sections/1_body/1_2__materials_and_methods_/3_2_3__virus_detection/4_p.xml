<p>RNA/DNA free water was used as the negative control, whereas for the positive control, a YFV gene fragment (5â€™-NC [
 <xref rid="B17-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) cloned into the pGemP plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used. The quantification of viral RNA from YFV infected mosquitoes were performed in comparison with serial dilution (from 10
 <sup>7</sup> to 1 copy of viral RNA) of a standard curve (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-insects-10-00136">Table S1</xref>) of the same gene used as the positive control. Therefore, it was possible to calculate the number of RNA copies per sample [
 <xref rid="B18-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The limit of detection was on the order of 100 copies that corresponded to a Ct value of 36.
