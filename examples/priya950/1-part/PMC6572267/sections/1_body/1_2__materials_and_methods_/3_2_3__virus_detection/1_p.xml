<p>Mosquitoes were individually macerated in screwcap tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) containing a glass bead (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan) and 150 μL of PBS for 1 min and 30 s using a minibeadbeater machine (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK, USA). RNA extraction was performed with 50 μL of macerated mosquito using 50 μL of squash buffer solution [Tris 99% (Inlab, São Paulo Brazil), sodium chloride (Synth, Diadema, Brazil), EDTA (Synth, Diadema, Brazil)] and added Proteinase K (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) 0.6 μL in Hard-Shell
 <sup>®</sup> 96-Well PCR Plates (low profile, thin walled, skirted, and white/clear) (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Extraction plates were heated on a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) at 56 °C for 5 min, followed by 98 °C for 15 min, and then were stored at 12 °C until PCR. In this type of extraction, there is no need for sample purification; in the final solution, there is RNA and DNA from the extracted material [
