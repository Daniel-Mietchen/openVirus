<p>All YFV positive samples (n = 13) were selected for viral isolation. The non-extracted part of the material that was stored at −80 °C was centrifuged for 2 min at 1500g at 12 °C. Then, 20 μL of the supernatant was inoculated into 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> T-bottles (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) prepared with an 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36 cell culture (2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per bottle) to isolate the virus. Adsorption was carried out for 1 hour at 28 °C and then 5 mL of L15 medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and Penicillin Streptomycin (Pen Strep) (Gibco Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 10 μg/mL was added [
