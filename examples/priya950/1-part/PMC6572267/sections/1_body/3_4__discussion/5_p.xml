<p>In a study carried out in 2008 in southern Brazil, a YFV infection rate of 1.88% was found for 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (
 <italic>Ochlerotatus</italic>) 
 <italic>serratus</italic> (Theobald, 1901) [
 <xref rid="B28-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although 97 mosquitoes of this species were captured during the present study, none of them tested positive for YFV. Two factors could explain the detection of YFV in 
 <italic>Ae. serratus</italic> infected in Cardoso [
 <xref rid="B28-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The first one could be the presence of viral RNA in the still undigested bloodmeal, and the second would be genetic compatibility between the viral isolate and the 
 <italic>Ae. serratus</italic> population present in that region which could be susceptible to the virus. Further studies are necessary to understand the role of 
 <italic>Ae. serratus</italic> as a YF vector.
