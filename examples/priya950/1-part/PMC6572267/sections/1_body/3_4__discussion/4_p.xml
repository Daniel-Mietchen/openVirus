 <italic>leucocelaenus</italic> (Dyar &amp; Shannon, 1924) is considered the main vector of YFV in the South Region of Brazil [
 <xref rid="B5-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], with most recent studies having detected YFV in this species [
 <xref rid="B28-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] which is more easily found in peri-urban areas due to its greater capacity of adapting to modified environments [
 <xref rid="B30-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although 42 mosquitoes of this species were collected, viral RNA was not detected in any of them.
