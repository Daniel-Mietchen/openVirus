 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> is a versatile mosquito. After feeding on a host infected with YFV and after the intrinsic period of infection, it is believed that the species can transmit the virus. Although there are no studies confirming viral transmission, it is considered to be the main vector since it is often found naturally infected at high rates [

A mosquito that becomes infected in one of the areas can easily get close to human populations through ecological corridors, making these residential condominiums important areas of risk for YFV transmission and, therefore, they should receive special attention from health authorities.
