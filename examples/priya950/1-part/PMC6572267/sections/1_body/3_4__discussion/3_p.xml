<p>Although three species of 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> spp. were collected (n = 42 specimens), YFV infection was not detected in any of them. Among the collected species, only 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> (
 <italic>Sabethes</italic>) 
 <italic>albiprivus</italic> Theobald, 1903 has been found to be naturally infected by YFV in South America [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is likely that more species of 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> than those already incriminated play a secondary role in YFV maintenance [
