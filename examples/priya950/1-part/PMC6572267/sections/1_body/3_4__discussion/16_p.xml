<p>Associated with YFV dispersion, mosquitoes can disperse the virus over long distances, as demonstrated by Causey et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] when they observed that of females of 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> (
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic>) 
 <italic>spegazzinii</italic> Br√®thes, 1912 were collected 11.5 km away from a release point in a few days. These mosquitoes appear to have great dispersal capacity beyond the forests where they emerged from their original larval habitat, a pattern also observed in Central Brazil [
 <xref rid="B44-insects-10-00136" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This great distance traveled by 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> females could be due to a climate with low precipitation which would lead to a reduction in the arrangement of tree holes containing water. In this way, the search for oviposition sites could help in a greater displacement, as well as the search for blood feeding sources for egg maturation. Reduction of NHPs and other wild animal populations as a consequence of the degradation of natural habitat and deaths by YF would cause a reduction of blood sources, inducing the dispersal of the mosquito. Associated with dispersion, it is also interesting to note that wind convection currents around dusk could help these mosquitoes to disperse [
