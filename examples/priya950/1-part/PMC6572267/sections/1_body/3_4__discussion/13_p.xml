<p>When new cases were reported in these states, the demand for vaccines increased in regions with high population density. With this, there was a need to increase the production of the vaccine in a short time. An alternative way to address this demand was the use of the fractionated vaccine. Recent studies have already indicated that the fractionated dose (587 IU) promoted similar immunity to the full dose (27,476 IU) [

However, this new strategy caused distrust in the population who did not believe that the fractionated dose was effective, thus impacting the coverage below the rates necessary to block local transmission at that moment of epidemics. Several yellow fever vaccination campaigns were promoted and an example of this was observed in January 2017. When the first cases were confirmed in Minas Gerais state, vaccination coverage was 57%, well below the 80% needed to stop local transmission. After intense vaccination campaigns, the coverage reached 90% in October 2018 [
