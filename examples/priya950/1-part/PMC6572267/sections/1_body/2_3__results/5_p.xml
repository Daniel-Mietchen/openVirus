<p>All YFV RNA-positive samples of the primary screening were isolated and confirmed via RT-qPCR. The number of viral RNA copies per milliliter obtained seven and 10 days after isolation are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00136-f003">Figure 3</xref>b. Quantification ranged from 10
 <sup>6</sup> to 10
 <sup>8</sup> copies of viral RNA/mL. Of the 13 isolated samples, 12 presented an increase in virus replication profile after 10 days compared to seven days. Only one sample did not present positive growth after seven days. Cells without supernatant inoculation (negative controlâ€”Mock) were indeed negative on RT-qPCR. The Ct value of the isolated samples are available in
