 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>) studied 88 healthy children &lt;2 years old who were followed with weekly nasopharyngeal samples during the months of the winter season of 2013â€“2014. A total of 1,408 nasopharyngeal samples were obtained, and 326 samples tested positive for RV (23.1%). Of these, 209 (64.1%) were not associated with respiratory symptoms, suggesting asymptomatic colonization.
