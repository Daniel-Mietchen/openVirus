<p>Evidence showing that a virus is present in the respiratory secretions of a patient with an RTI does not necessarily mean that that particular infectious agent is the cause of the disease. A virus can be the etiologic agent, but viruses can also be asymptomatically carried or shed for several weeks after an infection that has been cured. Therefore, viruses can be identified in the asymptomatic incubation period without having an actual role in the disease. Contrary to what was thought some years ago, viruses can asymptomatically colonize the airways. Both children admitted to the hospital for non-respiratory diseases and healthy children attending day care were shown to be carriers of at least one respiratory virus in ~30% of cases, although the viral load was generally lower in carriers than in symptomatic subjects (Jansen et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Moe et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Notably, the rate of asymptomatic colonization varies significantly from virus to virus. The detection of IV, RSV, hMPV, and PIV is generally indicative of disease, as the frequency of asymptomatic carriage of these agents is relatively uncommon. In contrast, the detection of certain other viruses raises many doubts due to the high frequency with which these viruses can be identified in asymptomatic children (Rhedin et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
