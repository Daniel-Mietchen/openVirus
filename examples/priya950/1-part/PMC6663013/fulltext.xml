We evaluated herd immunity prior to the 2017&#x02013;2018 influenza season in hemagglutination inhibition assay, and performed characterization of influenza viruses isolated from severe or fatal influenza cases and from influenza cases in people vaccinated in the fall of 2017. During the 2017&#x02013;2018 epidemic season, 87 influenza A and B viruses were isolated and viruses of the 75 influenza cases, including selected viral isolates and viruses analyzed directly from the original clinical material, were genetically characterized. The analyzed A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to clade 6B.1, B/Yamagata-like viruses belonged to clade 3, and B/Victoria-like viruses belonged to clade 1A and they were antigenically similar to the corresponding vaccine strains. A(H3N2) viruses belonged to clade 3C.2a and were difficult to characterize antigenically and the analysis indicated antigenic differences from the corresponding egg-grown vaccine strain. The next generation sequencing revealed the presence of D222/G/N polymorphism in the hemagglutinin gene in 32% of the analyzed A(H1N1)pdm09 lethal cases. This study demonstrated the importance of monitoring D222G/N polymorphism, including detection of minor viral variants with the mutations, in the hemagglutinin gene of A(H1N1)pdm09 for epidemiological surveillance. One strain of influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 was resistant to oseltamivir and had the H275Y amino acid substitution in the NA protein. All other isolates were susceptible to NA inhibitors. Prior to the 2017&#x02013;2018 epidemic season, 67.4 million people were vaccinated, which accounted for 46.6% of the country's population. Just before the epidemic season 33&#x02013;47% and 24&#x02013;30% of blood sera samples collected within the territory of Russia showed the presence of protective antibody titers against vaccine strains of influenza A and influenza B/Victoria-like, respectively. Mass vaccination of the population had evidently reduced the severity of the flu epidemic during the 2017&#x02013;2018 influenza epidemic season in Russia.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by State Assignments no. 1/16 and 2/18 (FBRI SRC VB VECTOR, Rospotrebnadzor), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vector.nsc.ru/">http://www.vector.nsc.ru/</ext-link>.

The disease symptoms range from mild, limited to the upper respiratory tract, to severe infection of the lower respiratory tract, which is fatal in some cases. Influenza virus infection can also lead to a wide range of non-respiratory complications affecting the heart, the central nervous system and other organs [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Influenza virus commonly causes annual seasonal epidemics. An emergence in the human population of a variant of influenza A virus with new antigenic properties may cause a pandemic and the absence of pre-existing immunity in humans is often associated with increased severity of disease and increased mortality [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Thereby, monitoring population immunity and severe cases of influenza is an essential activity carried out within the framework of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), which will allow time to track the appearance of variants of the virus with modified virological, molecular-biological and/or antigenic properties.</p><p>We have been studying the population humoral immunity and the epidemic situation of influenza in Russia since 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This study continues our work on annual evaluation of herd immunity to influenza just before the influenza epidemic seasons in Russia and analyses of circulating influenza viruses in Russia, with a focus on the influenza viruses which cause severe illness, including cases with lethal outcome.</p><p>The epidemic rise in the incidence of influenza in Russia began during the 6th to 7th weeks of 2018, which is much later than usual and about two months later than in Western Europe and the US. In contrast to Western countries, the epidemic rise in the influenza disease incidence was smooth, and throughout the epidemic, the A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses were detected in approximately equal proportions [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In general, the 2017&#x02013;2018 epidemic season in Russia was characterized by a low influenza disease incidence in persons vaccinated in the fall of 2017 and the overall low mortality [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was to assess population immunity to influenza viruses before the 2017&#x02013;2018 Russian epidemic season and to characterize influenza viruses from clinical material from cases of severe influenza disease, autopsy material from influenza disease cases with lethal outcome, and clinical material from individuals vaccinated in the fall of 2017.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study of herd immunity</title><p>The study on blood sera testing was approved by the Ethics Committee IRB 00001360 affiliated with the Federal Budgetary Research Institution State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology &#x0201c;Vector&#x0201d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vector.nsc.ru/eticheskiy-komitet/">http://www.vector.nsc.ru/eticheskiy-komitet/</ext-link>).

It is known that the presence of D222G and D222N mutations in the HA gene often correlates with increased disease severity and mortality. These mutations provide increased tropism of the virus to the cells of the lower parts of the human respiratory tract, which can lead to an increased risk of developing viral pneumonia. Some researchers suggest that increased virulence and lethality of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus may be caused by the presence of D222G/N mutations in HA [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>It is suggested that these mutations accumulate as a result of selection from a mixture of influenza virus variants (quasi-species) in the lower parts of the respiratory tract where avian-like alpha-2,3 receptors with higher affinity for viruses with D222G/N mutations in the HA are more common compared to the upper respiratory tract. This selection occurs inside the infected organism, and at the stage of infection, D222G/N mutations are either absent or not dominant. This feature of D222G/N mutations highlights the critical importance of detecting the presence of minor quasi-species of the viruses with these mutations in clinical samples, since their presence can lead to selection of more pathogenic virus variants inside the body under favorable conditions [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

The presence of multiple virus quasi-species in a viral population and their interaction with the immune system can lead to rapid adaptation and escape from immune control, as has been shown for primary HIV infection. These factors may possibly lead to a more severe disease [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>For more precise data interpretation it is important to note that in our study, we observed 2&#x02013;3 fold increase in quasispecies with D222G/N mutations in HA of two viral isolates obtained after one passage on MDCK cells compared to the original material, where these mutations were already present in significant quantities (<xref rid="pone.0220401.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This increase in proportion of the mutations may have been caused by selection of the mutations due to receptor properties of MDCK cells [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Receptor specificity mutations such as D222G/N in the HA gene, which increase tropism to 2,3-linked sialic acid receptors, are known to be selected during virus cultivation in embryonated chicken eggs which have avian-like 2,3-linked sialic acid receptors in allantoic cells [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Cultivation of human influenza viruses on MDCK cells has proved to be a good alternative to egg inoculation. MDCK cells are easy to handle, reliable in maintaining genetic stability and are used as the standard cell line for influenza virus propagation [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. MDCK cells have both 2,6- and 2,3-linked sialic acid receptors and due to this property may potentially favor selection of viral quasispecies that grow well in those cell types. In previously reported genetic stability studies of influenza virus propagation on MDCK cells, it was shown that receptor specificity mutations were not detected in viral isolates obtained after the first passage on MDCK cell [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but that these mutations may arise through multiple passages [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Considering demonstrated genetic stability of the viral isolates after the first passage on MDCK cells, the presence of D222G/N mutations in major proportion in viral isolates obtained after one passage on MDCK cells, as was observed in our study, is indicative of the presence of the mutations in the original specimens, possibly in smaller proportions. Probability of the origin and speed of selection of D222G/N mutations in MDCK viral isolates needs to be further investigated in order to more precisely evaluate the significance of the observed genetic changes of seasonal influenza viruses in studies that employ virus isolation using MDCK cells.</p><p>For epidemiological analysis, it is important to determine the factors influencing transmissibility and selection of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with D222G/N mutations in humans. Selection of 222G/N virus variants can be influenced by virological properties as well as by the presence of risk factors in a person [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Selection of D222G/N mutations inside an infected organism occurs due to the acquired increased ability of the virus to bind to &#x003b1;-2,3-type sialic acid receptors, which are present in the lower respiratory tract. However, in these mutant strains, the tropism to the cells of the human upper respiratory tract, where &#x003b1;-2,6-type sialic acid receptors are predominantly present, is weakened, and as a result, this may lead to reduced transmissibility of the mutant viruses among people. The reduced ability of the virus to spread through an infection of the upper respiratory tract may explain the low circulation of viruses with major variants of D222G/N mutations [<xref rid="pone.0220401.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Detecting D222G/N polymorphism, monitoring the increase in circulation of variants with D222G/N mutations and studying the evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with D222G/N mutations, especially studying transmissibility, reassortment and the effect of genetic and virological properties of the virus on the pandemic potential, are necessary for timely identification of the emergence of potential pandemic threats in the circulating population of A(H1N1)pdm2009 viruses and are of particular importance for epidemiological analysis and prognosis.</p><p>Among the 87 analyzed isolates of influenza A and B viruses, only one A(H1N1)pdm09 strain isolated from a lethal case of influenza was resistant to oseltamivir while remaining susceptible to zanamivir; it contained the H275Y amino acid substitution in the NA protein. It is not known whether the patient was taking oseltamivir. Drug resistance can be a result of either selection in the viral population in patients taking anti-neuraminidase therapy or spontaneous mutation.

All the viral isolates, except A(H3N2), were antigenically similar to the corresponding vaccine strains, according to the serological analysis. The analysis of A(H3N2) isolates indicated antigenic differences from the corresponding egg-grown vaccine strain.</p><p>The next generation sequencing of the original clinical material and isolated influenza strains of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses revealed major or minor viral variants with HA containing D222G/N mutations, which were previously associated with the increased severity of the disease and mortality, in 32% of the analyzed lethal cases. This study demonstrated the importance of monitoring D222G/N polymorphism in the HA of A(H1N1)pdm09, including detection of minor virus variants with the mutations for epidemiological surveillance.</p><p>Of the 87 analyzed viral isolates only one strain of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was resistant to oseltamivir and had the H275Y amino acid substitution in the NA protein. All other isolates were susceptible to NA inhibitors.</p><p>Influenza vaccination and treatment with NA inhibitor drugs at the first manifestation of clinical signs of influenza disease are effective means of population protection against influenza.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220401.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>The phylogenetic tree for HA of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza viruses analyzed in this study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220401.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220401.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>The phylogenetic tree for HA of A(H3N2) influenza viruses analyzed in this study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220401.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220401.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>The phylogenetic tree for HA of B/Yamagata-like influenza viruses analyzed in this study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220401.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220401.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>The phylogenetic tree for HA of B/Victoria-like influenza viruses analyzed in this study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220401.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220401.s005"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Amino acid substitutions in genomes of A(H1N1)pdm2009 viruses in comparison with the A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine strain.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220401.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220401.s006"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Description of amino acid substitutions detected in A(H1N1pdm2009) viruses.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220401.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220401.s007"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Amino acid substitutions in genomes of A(H3N2) viruses in comparison with the egg-based A/HongKong/4801/2014 vaccine strain.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220401.s007.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220401.s008"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Description of amino acid substitutions detected in A(H3N2) viruses.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220401.s008.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220401.s009"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Type B influenza virus cases characteristics.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220401.s009.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220401.s010"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>Case characteristics and properties of influenza viruses isolated and characterized in the 2017&#x02013;2018 epidemic season.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220401.s010.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors of the manuscript would like to thank their colleagues from the Sanitary-and-Epidemiological Centers of the Federal Service for Surveillance of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor) of the Russian Federation for providing primary clinical material in a timely fashion to the FBRI SRC VB &#x0201c;Vector&#x0201d;, Rospotrebnadzor.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0220401.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>McCauley</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hongo</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kaverin</surname><given-names>NV</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kochs</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lamb</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Matrosovich</surname><given-names>MN</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
