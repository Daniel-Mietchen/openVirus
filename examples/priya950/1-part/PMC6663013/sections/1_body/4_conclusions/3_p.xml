<p>The next generation sequencing of the original clinical material and isolated influenza strains of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses revealed major or minor viral variants with HA containing D222G/N mutations, which were previously associated with the increased severity of the disease and mortality, in 32% of the analyzed lethal cases. This study demonstrated the importance of monitoring D222G/N polymorphism in the HA of A(H1N1)pdm09, including detection of minor virus variants with the mutations for epidemiological surveillance.</p>
