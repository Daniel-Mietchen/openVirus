<p>Analysis of amino acid substitutions in the HA of the studied influenza A(H3N2) viruses in comparison with the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 vaccine strain revealed the presence of several mutations in antigenic site A in all studied viruses (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220401.s008">S4</xref> Tables). Most of these mutations were shown to be associated with antigenic drift. In addition, all studied viruses had mutations in antigenic site B, one of which, P194L, is in a site of antibody recognition and another mutation, K160T, was shown to be associated with antigenic drift. T160K reverse mutation was shown to be an adaptation mutation to the growth in embryonated chicken eggs [
