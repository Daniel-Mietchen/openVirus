<p>In the Russian Federation, just before the 2017–2018 epidemic season, 67.4 million people were vaccinated, which accounted for 46.6% of the country's population. In the risk groups, the percentage of vaccinated individuals was even higher (89% of the employees of medical facilities, 85% of the employees of educational institutions, 70% of students (age 7 to 23 years), 63% of people over 60 years old) [

The percentage of the population with protective antibody titers was 24%-47% against the influenza vaccine strains prior to the 2017–2018 epidemic season and it was similar to the assessment data obtained before the 2016–2017 epidemic season [

In the 2017–2018 epidemic season, the SRC VB “Vector”, Rospotrebnadzor received clinical samples from 136 cases of influenza among individuals vaccinated in the fall of 2017, 60% of which included cases of influenza disease among children under the age of 18 years old. These data may be partly explained by the suggestion that the protective antibody titers for children should be significantly higher than for adults (1:110 compared to 1:40) [
