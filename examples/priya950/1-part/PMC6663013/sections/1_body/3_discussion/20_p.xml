<p>Among the 87 analyzed isolates of influenza A and B viruses, only one A(H1N1)pdm09 strain isolated from a lethal case of influenza was resistant to oseltamivir while remaining susceptible to zanamivir; it contained the H275Y amino acid substitution in the NA protein. It is not known whether the patient was taking oseltamivir. Drug resistance can be a result of either selection in the viral population in patients taking anti-neuraminidase therapy or spontaneous mutation. In the epidemic season of 2017â€“2018, however, no more than 1% of the influenza viruses analyzed in the Northern Hemisphere were characterized by a decrease in sensitivity to NA inhibitors [
