<p>It is suggested that these mutations accumulate as a result of selection from a mixture of influenza virus variants (quasi-species) in the lower parts of the respiratory tract where avian-like alpha-2,3 receptors with higher affinity for viruses with D222G/N mutations in the HA are more common compared to the upper respiratory tract. This selection occurs inside the infected organism, and at the stage of infection, D222G/N mutations are either absent or not dominant. This feature of D222G/N mutations highlights the critical importance of detecting the presence of minor quasi-species of the viruses with these mutations in clinical samples, since their presence can lead to selection of more pathogenic virus variants inside the body under favorable conditions [

In this study, analysis of the presence of polymorphism in the 222 position of the HA protein using NGS data revealed a minor presence of D222G/N mutations in the viruses from the primary material of two lethal cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection (
