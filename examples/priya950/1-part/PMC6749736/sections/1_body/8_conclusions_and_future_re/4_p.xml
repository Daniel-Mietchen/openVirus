<p>As regards ASFV survivability and its indirect transmission, there are still data that are missing,
 <italic>.e.g</italic>. those to result from investigation of the mechanism explaining outbreaks on high-biosecurity farms located near areas where infected wild boars are present but direct contact between them and domestic pigs is not possible. Further studies concerning arthropodsâ€™ competence to become a mechanical vector for ASFV spread are needed. ASFV susceptibility to various environmental conditions is well studied; nevertheless there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the possibility of virus transmission on the surfaces of certain fomites,
 <italic>.e.g</italic>. fresh grass contaminated with viable ASFV originating from wild boars, which could also elucidate the source of disease at least on part of the farms of Central Europe.
