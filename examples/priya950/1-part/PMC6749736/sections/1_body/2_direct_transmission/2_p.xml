<p>As regards excretions and secretions, it has been demonstrated that they might contain viable virus (1.6â€“4.8 log

ASFV survivability in these contaminated excretions depends mainly on temperature; however, in favourable conditions it may retain its viability for long time, increasing the risk of the disease spreading, particularly under low-biosecurity conditions (
