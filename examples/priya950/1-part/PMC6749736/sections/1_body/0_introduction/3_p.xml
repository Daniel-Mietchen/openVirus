<p>Due to its high stability, ASFV is able to persist for a long time in contaminated fomites or meat; therefore they could play a role as vehicles for the transboundary or even transcontinental spread of the pathogen. Such a mode of dissemination is one of the most frequent routes of ASFV introduction into territories previously free of it. For example, in 2007 an ASF outbreak in Georgia was caused by improper disposal of contaminated pork meat from a ship at Poti docks. Similar events occurred in history to cause other ASFV introductions, namely to Portugal (1957), Cuba (1971), Brazil (1978), and Belgium (1985) (

Besides through the negligence by which humans spread the disease transnationally, ASFV is present in an environment because of its long persistence in wild boar carcasses, which can in effect be a virus reservoir. Therefore eradication of the disease is extremely difficult, due to the necessity of actively searching for decaying boar cadavers to make possible the proper disposal of infected carcasses (
