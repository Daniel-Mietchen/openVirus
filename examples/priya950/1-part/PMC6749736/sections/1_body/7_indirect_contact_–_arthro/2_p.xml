<p>Nevertheless, as several cases of ASFV outbreaks have been reported on high-biosecurity farms in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States where the density of infected wild boars was high, the question arises whether arthropods may play a mechanical vector role between wild and domestic pigs. Hard ticks were investigated to determine their competence as an ASFV vector. ASFV was not detected either in the field-collected ticks or ticks fed infectious blood which transmitted the virus to susceptible animals in laboratory conditions (
 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2019-0058_ref_008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). ASF virus does not replicate within the tick organisms; however, viral DNA could be detected from six to eight weeks after feeding with infected blood. Therefore, hard ticks may represent only a potential mechanical but not a biological vector in transmission between wild boars and pigs (8).
