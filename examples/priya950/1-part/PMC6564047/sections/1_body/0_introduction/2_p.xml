<p>CHIKV are phylogenetically classified into three major genotypes, the West Africa, the Asia, and the East-Central South Africa (ECSA). The Asian genotype was the cause of recent outbreaks in the Caribbean and United States [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In Brazil, both Asian and ECSA genotypes have been reported, with the outbreak in Rio de Janeiro beginning in 2014, being attributed to the ECSA genotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It has been reported that phylogenetic diversification and infectivity differences among CHIKV may be correlated [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the evolution of CHIKV may be related to the viral adaptation in mosquito vectors and mammalian hosts.
