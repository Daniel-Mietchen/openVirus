<p>The re-emerging ECSA genotype was reported to have adapted to the 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito, and to produce more virus particles in that mosquito population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which might result in large urban epidemics. It was also reported that ECSA genotype CHIKV infection provoked high viral load in the patient [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], suggesting that adaptive mutation in the CHIKV envelope causes high replication efficiency [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, acquired immunity after CHIKV infection has been reported to be critical for further protection against CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The immunity is long-lasting and suggested to be cross-reactive based on the combination of the genotypes (serotypes) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, cohort studies with identification of pathogen lineages will be required for a better understanding of chikungunya epidemics. Many lineages from diverse geographical areas have potential to spread out to other geographies through travel, vectors, and reservoir animals. However, in most of the epidemic cases, sequence analysis under resource-limited conditions remains very challenging. The present study demonstrated that by combining LAMP and MinION, sequencing on site is very feasible. The blood or serum sample are directly applied to CHIK-CZC-LAMP system without RNA extraction and RT-LAMP can be performed with a battery driven portable incubator and without the need for specialized equipment. The same device can be used for MinION sample preparation, and sequencing can be done with a laptop computer. Therefore, the system is not dependent on stable electricity. The estimated cost of CZC-LAMP system was approximately one dollar per tube, which is much more affordable than RT-PCR or qRT-PCR. The MinION platform requires lower initial costs than other sequencer devices, and can read multiplexed samples, although we only used small sample size in this study. If more sample numbers are applied in one flow cell, the cost for the system will also be reduced.
