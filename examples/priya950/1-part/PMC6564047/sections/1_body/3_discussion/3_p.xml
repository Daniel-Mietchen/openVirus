<p>Distinguishing CHIKV from Dengue fever or Zika fever is also important, but it is often challenging in the clinical setting, as these viruses share the same vectors, and have similar presenting clinical symptoms. The evidence of the co-circulation of dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV) and CHIKV has been also reported [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Hence, multiplex or panel of diagnostics for those arbovirus infections will be also required. The RT-LAMP methods for ZIKAV and DENV has been available [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and the MinION analysis from DENV RT-LAMP had been also been established [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, we anticipate such multiplex assays will soon be established.
