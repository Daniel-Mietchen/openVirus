<p>The in-house dried CHIKV RT-LAMP system was produced by using a trehalose vitrification technique based on a previous report [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with several modifications. Trehalose (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) was prepared by dissolving in deionized distilled water (2 mol/L = 2M) in 85 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 1 hour. The Trehalose solution (1.6 μl, 2M), deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) (1.4 μl, 25mM each) (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), WarmStart RTx reverse transcriptase (0.25 μl, 15 U/μl) (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich, MA), RNase inhibitor (0.1 μl, 40 U/μl) (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), and 
 <italic>Bst</italic> 2.0 WarmStart DNA polymerase (0.05 μl, 120 U/μl and 0.25 μl, 8 U/μl) (New England Biolabs Inc.) were then mixed. We used two different concentrations of 
 <italic>Bst</italic> 2.0 WarmStart DNA polymerase to adjust the glycerol amount in the reaction mixtures, which resulted in an effective drying time and enzyme stability [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The enzyme mixture solution (3.65 μl) was placed inside of the tube lid. The LAMP primer sets for CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] were prepared in deionized distilled water. FIP and BIP (0.4 μl each), F3 and B3 (0.05 μl each), and FLF and BLP (0.2 μl each), trehalose (0.7 μl, 2M), and the colori-fluorometric indicator (CFI)(1 μl) were mixed and the mixture solution (2.35 μl) was placed at the bottom of the same reaction tube as the enzyme mixture solution had been placed on the lid. CFI consists of 3 mM hydroxyl-naphtol blue (HNB; MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) and 0.35% v/v GelGreen (10,000X solution in DMSO, Biotium, Hayward, CA) dissolved in distilled water. The tubes were air dried with a fan in a grove box connected with an ultra-low dew point air dryer (QD20-50; IAC Co., Kawasaki, Japan) for 12 hours. The tubes with dried mixture solutions were kept with molecular sieves 3A (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical) in an aluminium bag at ambient temperature.
