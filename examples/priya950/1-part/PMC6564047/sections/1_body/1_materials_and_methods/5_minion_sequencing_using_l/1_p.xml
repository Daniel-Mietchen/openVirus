<p>The genomic DNA Sequencing kit SQK-MAP-006 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford Science Park, UK) was initially used for CHIKV SL10571 and S27 in which one sample was analyzed in an individual flow-cell. Briefly, LAMP products (2 μl) were directly used for end-repairing and dA-tailing using the NEBNext Ultra II End Repair/dA-tailing module (New England Biolabs) by incubation at 20°C for 5 minutes, then 65 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 minutes, and subsequently purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) with a magnetic stand. Adaptors (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) were then ligated at room temperature for 10 minutes by Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix (New England Biolabs). The resultant adapter-ligated DNA was purified by Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Thereafter, samples were eluted with elution buffer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and the resultant libraries were applied to the MinION Flow-Cell (R7.0) with buffer and fuel mix, and the Genomic DNA 48-hour sequencing protocol was used with the MinKNOW software (Oxford Nanopore Technology). The base call was performed with the Metrichor Agent (

As for LAMP products from clinical samples, a 1D Native barcoding genomic DNA kit (with EXP-NBD103 and SQK-LSK108, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was applied according to the manufacture’s instruction. Briefly, LAMP products (2 μl) were ligated with each barcode by Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix (New England Biolabs), purified by AMPure XP beads, then all samples were pooled and applied to the single MinION Flow-Cell (R9.4, FLO-MIN106) in MK1b device.
