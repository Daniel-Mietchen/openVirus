<p>The time of positivity to obtain an amplification signal by the CHIKV-CZC-LAMP was correlated with Ct values. The time required for the amplification of 50 PFU CHIKV genome was 15 to 18 min in the absence of blood, and 18 to 23 min for CHIKV genome in the presence of blood (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007480.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The reaction time of CHIKV genome with blood was delayed a few minutes compared to that without blood, suggesting that the delay of the reaction time may be due to inhibitory effect of the reaction by blood or more probably fluorescent masking effect by the blood color.
