<p>We have established the dried RT-LAMP system for the detection of the CHIKV genome (CHIKV-CZC-LAMP) from clinical samples, containing dried-reagents in the reaction tubes, and which were stored at ambient temperatures for prolonged periods. The CHIK-CZC-LAMP system consists of reaction tubes, reaction buffer, an isothermal incubator, and a LED LAMP reaction detector (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007480.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The sensitivity of the CHIKV-CZC-LAMP was evaluated using purified RNAs from CHIKV pulsed with or without 1 Î¼l of human blood. Positive reactions were recognized as yellow fluorescence under a LED detector, and a positive reaction could also be recognized as change of sample color from violet to sky blue by the naked eye (upper column in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007480.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). As for blood-added samples, the reaction tubes were briefly centrifuged to recognize fluorescence more clearly (lower column in
