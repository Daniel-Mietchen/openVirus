<p>To evaluate the performance of the four DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents in detecting DENV in serum samples, side-by-side comparison with the multiplex CDC DENV-1-4 Real Time RT-PCR Assay (reference qRT-PCR) [
 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] was performed. The reference qRT-PCR assay includes 4 sets of oligonucleotide primers and 4 dually labeled 5’ fluorescent TaqMan probes to differentiate the four serotypes. The reaction was performed with a SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) without 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine in a Magnetic Induction Cycler (MIC, Bio Molecular System, Upper Coomera, Queensland, Australia). Each reaction included 5 μl of the sample nucleic acid. Signals from the DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 probes were collected using the 6-carboxyfluorescein, hexachlorofluorescein, Texas red, and Cy5 channels, respectively. The thermocycling program included an RT step at 50°C for 30 min, followed by 95°C for 2 min and 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and annealing at 60°C for 1 min. Samples generating a threshold cycle (
