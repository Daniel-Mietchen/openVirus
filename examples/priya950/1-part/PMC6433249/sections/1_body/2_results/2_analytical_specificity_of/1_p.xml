<p>To assess the specificity of each DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagent, the four DENV serotypes and two other viruses (Zika virus MR766, Zika virus PRVABC59, and chikungunya virus CK9500004) known to cause febrile illness or skin rash illness were tested. All four singleplex DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents did not react with the other three non-targeted dengue virus serotypes, Zika virus and chikungunya virus in the exclusivity test panel (
