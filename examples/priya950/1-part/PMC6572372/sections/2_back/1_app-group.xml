   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01759-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Figure S1: Satellite image from Landsat 8 mission for the Barranquilla area obtained in December 2014. The image shows maps of natural band combination (4-3-2) and infrared colour combination (5-4-3), and the derived products that resulted from the supervised classification and calculation of the MNDWI. Figure S2. Satellite image from Landsat 8 mission for the Barranquilla area obtained in December 2015. The image shows maps of natural band combination (4-3-2) and infrared colour combination (5-4-3), and the derived products that resulted from the supervised classification and calculation of MNDWI. Figure S3. Incidence of CHIKV case infected case notifications to SIVIGILA (N.B. the case definitions are described in the Methods section). Each bar represents one week. Figure S4. The estimated incidence of CHIKV-infected cases per 10,000 residents by neighbourhood in Barranquilla between 2014 and 2015. Figure S5. The univariate Local Moran’s I (LISA) cluster map of the overall incidence of CHIKV-infected cases in 2014–2016. Figure S6. Incidence of ZIKV-infected case notifications to SIVIGILA (N.B. the case definitions are described in the Methods section). Each bar represents one week. Figure S7. The estimated incidence of ZIKV-infected cases per 10,000 residents by neighbourhood in Barranquilla between 2015 and 2016. Figure S8. The univariate Local Moran’s I (LISA) cluster map of the overall incidence of ZIKV-infected cases in 2014–2016. Figure S9. Local Moran’s I analysis on the residuals resulting from fitting the ZIKV SIR values with spatial explanatory variables and independent random effects. Maps show (A) the persisting local clusters and (B) their corresponding
