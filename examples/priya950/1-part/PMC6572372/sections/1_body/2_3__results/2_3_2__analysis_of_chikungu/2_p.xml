<p>When the CHIKV incidence rate was displayed in maps by neighbourhoods (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-01759">Figure S4</xref>), there were two clear areas of high incidence rates (within the 5th quantile), particularly in the northern area and the southwestern area, located next to the main western circular road route around the city. The global univariate Moran’s I statistic for the total incidence of CHIKV-infected cases during the study period was 0.091 (pseudo 
 <italic>p</italic>-value 0.0026), suggesting a global clustering pattern across the study area. The LISA cluster map showed one significant cluster of high–high incidence (‘hotspot’) in the southwestern (neighbourhoods: 1204, 1205, 1206, and, 3704) area of the city (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-01759">Figures S1 and S5</xref> for neighbourhood codes).
