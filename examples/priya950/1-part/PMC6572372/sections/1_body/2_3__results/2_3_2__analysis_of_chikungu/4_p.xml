<p>The Bayesian Poisson model of CHIKV SIR values fitted with the explanatory variables (SES, population density, housing density, percentage house dwellings, female resident ratio, vegetation coverage, distance to major roads, distance to parks or cemeteries, and distance to water bodies) and with no random effects showed a poor fitting performance of the incidence data (DIC: 1718.3) (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01759-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Looking at the posterior predictive distributions and the posterior predictive 
 <italic>p</italic>-value, there were clear signs of over-dispersion, since the high degree of variability in the observed SIR values was not accounted for by the model. We therefore introduced a set of independent random effects using the model 2 approach (Text S2) to capture the remaining variability. Since the model 1 approach showed a spatial structure on the distribution of CHIKV SIR values across Barranquilla, we assessed the persisting spatial correlation on the residuals for the fitted model 2, controlling for spatially varying explanatory variables. Indeed, we still observed significant global residual dependence (Moran’s I statistic: 0.0716, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value: 0.04); thus, we opted to employ a set of spatially structured random effects that could cope with a global spatial correlation (model 3 approach). Model 3, the globally smooth CAR model with spatially correlated random effects (Text S2) showed the better fitting performance, as indicated by its DIC value (DIC: 733.4) (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01759-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and the resulting residuals no longer showed any presence of spatial dependency (Moran’s I statistic: 0.0202, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value: 0.08), thereby reinforcing our model selection.
