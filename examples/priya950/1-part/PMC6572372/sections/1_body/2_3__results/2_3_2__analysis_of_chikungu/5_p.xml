 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01759-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the regression coefficients for the spatial fixed effects considered to fit CHIKV SIR values, based on the model 3 approach. Risk of CHIKV case incidences appeared to slightly decrease with increasing percentage of vegetation coverage (Coefficient 0.99, 95% CI 0.97, 1.00). The poorest neighbourhoods, based on three levels of SES (quantiles), were the most at risk for CHIKV infections (reference low SES, medium SES coefficient 0.40, 95% CI 0.22, 0.72; high SES 0.61, 95% CI 0.24, 1.52). In our model, population density, housing density, and percent of dwellings that were houses showed little effect on the incidence of CHIKV-infected cases, while infection risk was increased by 10% for a unit percentage increase of female residents. None of these associations were, however, statistically significant.
