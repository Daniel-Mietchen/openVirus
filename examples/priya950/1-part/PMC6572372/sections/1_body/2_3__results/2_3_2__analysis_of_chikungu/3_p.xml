<p>The analysis of local clustering over time (differential LISA analysis) showed a clear evolution of the CHIKV epidemic during the months of peak incidence from July 2014 to January 2015. Hotspots appeared in the northwestern area of the city at outbreak onset (neighbourhoods: 0301, 0305, 0307 and 0311 and later in the epidemic also together with 0102, 0201, and 0312), which then moved to the southwestern area (neighbourhoods: 1204, 1205, 1208, 3704). The hotspot area expanded from a single neighbourhood (1206: El Pueblo), located immediately adjacent to the main warehouses used for delivery and export of cargo to and from the city by road and sea, from August to September to three neighbourhoods (1204, 1205, and 3704) in October to November (
