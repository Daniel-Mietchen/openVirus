<p>For 21.3% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 30) of the neighbourhoods, there were no data of their housing densities, nor were there data on the percentage of houses versus apartments for 13.5% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 19) of the neighbourhoods. Missing data were not, however, a concern for all the other variables, since those data were not available for fewer than 5% of the neighbourhoods. Amongst the recorded cases in the original dataset, the resident neighbourhoods were unknown for 5.9% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 110) and 10.5% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 746) of the patients with CHIKV or ZIKV infections, respectively.
