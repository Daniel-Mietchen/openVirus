 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01759-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> displays the regression coefficients for the spatial fixed effects considered to fit the ZIKV SIR values based on the model 4 approach. The risk for ZIKV case incidences did not vary or varied very little according to the distance of dwellings from parks or cemeteries and water bodies, or the percentage of vegetation coverage. Surprisingly, the proportion of female residents also did not appear to be associated with the ZIKV case incidence. However, the richest neighbourhoods (SES 5 and 6) were significantly more at risk for ZIKV infections compared to those of the low and medium SES (
