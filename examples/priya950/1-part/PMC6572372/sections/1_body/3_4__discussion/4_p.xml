<p>Alternatively, these findings may indicate a reporting bias resulting from these residents having better access to health facilities with resultant higher positive diagnosis rates. The issue of reporting bias was likely exacerbated during the ZIKV epidemic by the widespread media coverage drawn by the association of ZIKV with congenital defects, sexual transmission and severe autoimmune diseases [

 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Those with easier access to clinics would have been more likely to present to clinic with milder symptoms and receive the diagnosis of ZIKV as it was sweeping through the city. In addition, people living in higher socioeconomic strata would be more likely to be receiving regular prenatal healthcare, where there is already an over diagnosis of ZIKV [

Our findings may therefore be supported by finding that poverty was associated with reduced ZIKV case reporting in another recent study [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, the health authority teamâ€™s access to these high-risk areas is urgently required to assess whether these results were due to the lack of vector surveillance and control or a higher incidence of case reporting. To our knowledge, higher incidences of vector-borne diseases have usually been associated with lower socioeconomic status [

 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The evidence we present here indicates that either the CHIKV and ZIKV epidemics occurred in different ecological niches or the case reporting of ZIKV infection was novel amongst the arboviral infections.
