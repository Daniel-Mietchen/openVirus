<p>The global cluster analysis of the CHIKV-infected case incidences identified hotspots of transmission in the southwestern area of the city. The monthly analysis of local autocorrelation showed that the CHIKV epidemic began within hotspots in the northern area and then moved quickly to the southwestern region of this city, affecting mostly the poorest communities, following the main western circular route (circumvent roads) that was also connected via a road with the principal truck transport depot and the southern road route to the city of Cartagena (

However, it may have also been reintroduced via boats arriving in the international harbour area on the Magdalena River (neighbourhood 2103) or via the road route (southeast direction) to the city of Santa Marta, and finally being transported from those northern neighbourhoods to the adjacent ones in December to January 2015. While there was little global spatial autocorrelation for the ZIKV-infected case incidence, the monthly analysis of local autocorrelation showed a high-risk area in the northern neighbourhoods of the city as the outbreak began. As the outbreak intensified, the centralâ€“eastern neighbourhoods of the city became important hotspots. It seemed that the ZIKV epidemic spread to the eastern part of the city probably through the main circular road, and a major road that crossed from the northwestern to the mideastern part of the city, in a clockwise direction (
