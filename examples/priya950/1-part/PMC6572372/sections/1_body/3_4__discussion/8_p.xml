<p>The findings in our study are novel in their attempt to correlate previous epidemiological patterns of DENV-infected case incidence neighbourhood risk factors discussed above with those of recent outbreaks of CHIKV and ZIKV. Our spatial exploration clearly identified neighbourhoods that had been hotspots responsible for driving the epidemic waves of CHIKV and ZIKV. It is therefore essential that these hotspots be constantly targeted by the local health authority to reduce 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> breeding sites to a minimum and quickly act to target all areas in and surrounding them when any cases of CHIV or ZIKV are reported. The risk factor analysis provided strong evidence that higher socioeconomic status and living in a residence closer to the main roads were risk factors for ZIKV case incidence. In Barranquilla, the Public Health Department should be empowered to commit more resources to these areas of the city. While it may seem counterintuitive to direct public resources to areas of higher SES, it is urgently required to determine whether higher 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> vector populations or increased residentsâ€™ reporting accounts for our findings. If the former case was responsible, then the public health authorities must identify and destroy the vector breeding sites through drainage or larvicidal treatment.
