<p>We believe this is the first report that provides strong evidence that living in higher SES is a risk factor for ZIKV case incidences. Furthermore, the northern neighbourhoods of Barranquilla are of these higher SES, and these neighbourhoods located there were the first to report high infection incidences and appeared to drive both the CHIKV and ZIKV outbreaks. Unfortunately, the local health authority’s vector surveillance and control teams stated that it has been difficult to implement their work in areas of higher SES due to them being walled and gated communities (‘conjuntos’) with private security guards providing restricted access. Thus, limited, or lack of, access to identify and treat vector-breeding sites in these areas may have accounted for their higher ZIKV case incidence. </p>
