<p>Since 2013, the two emerging arboviruses, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by the same vector species (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) as the dengue viruses (DENVs), have caused major outbreaks throughout the Americas. CHIKV is thought to have first arrived in the Caribbean region in 2013, and in 2014, it expanded to the mainland regions of Central and South America [

 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. CHIKV infections are characterised by a high fever and debilitating symmetrical polyarthralgia/rheumatic disease in nearly all (&gt;80%) cases, many of which result in subchronic or chronic joint disease [

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. By stark contrast, 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, and symptomatic patients display lower fevers and milder peripheral symptoms, such as rash, nonpurulent conjunctivitis and oedema [

However, in the Americas, ZIKV infections have been implicated in causing severe congenital abnormalities, such as foetal microcephaly, and serious autoimmune neurologic conditions in children and adults, such as Guillain–-Barré syndrome [
