<p>Numerous studies have assessed the local determinants of transmission for the DENVs that in turn led to key discoveries that helped to guide public health and vector control programmes in their efforts to curb epidemics [

For example, Sissoko et al. found that seroprevalence of CHIKV antibodies in Mayotte was mainly associated with lower socioeconomic status, lower education and makeshift housing [
