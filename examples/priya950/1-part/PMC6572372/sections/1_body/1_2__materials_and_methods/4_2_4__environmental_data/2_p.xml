<p>A map layer in shapefile format that identified parks, forests and cemeteries throughout the city was downloaded from the bbike.org website [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We used a high-resolution satellite map from the city to verify the accuracy of the delineated green areas. The Euclidian distance of these identified parks, forests or cemeteries throughout the city was then calculated using the same approach employed to estimate distance of the residents’ dwellings from water bodies. We then referred to this variable as ‘distance to parks or cemeteries.’ Each of the covariates listed above were then linked to the map of neighbourhoods in Barranquilla along with the monthly incidence of CHIKV and ZIKV cases. Previous studies have shown that vegetation coverage and distance to parks [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] as well as distance to large water bodies [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] have been important predictors of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>-borne infections. Thus, we included them in our multivariate regression models.
