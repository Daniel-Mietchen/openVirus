<p>Exploratory analysis of spatial clustering was conducted using a global Moran’s I statistic and local indicators of spatial association (LISA). The univariate Moran’s I statistic was used to explore the existence of overall spatial autocorrelation for the total incidence of CHIKV and ZIKV cases throughout Barranquilla, whereas LISA analysis was implemented to explore local spatial autocorrelation and identify hotspots among neighbourhoods. An area of high–high correlation (hotspot) indicated that the estimated incidence exceeded the neighbourhood average. An area of high–low correlation indicates that the central neighbourhood was negatively correlated with its neighbours, having a higher than average incidence, compared to a lower than average incidence in the neighbours. Alternatively, low–low correlation indicated that neighbourhoods were correlated together with lower than average incidence. However, low–high indicated negative correlation with the central neighbourhood having lower than average incidence compared to a higher than average incidence in its neighbours. More details about the implementation of these statistics are provided in
