<p>This study provided an evidence-based framework that public health programmes can use to efficiently target the drivers of future epidemics of CHIKV and ZIKV infections. Our spatial analysis identified key areas of Barranquilla that acted as hotspots during the outbreaks of CHIKV and ZIKV. Furthermore, we clearly showed that living in the high SES was a risk factor for ZIKV case incidence, though this may have been driven by biased case reporting. These richer areas were important hotpots of case incidence during both outbreaks. This novel finding challenges the logic that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>-borne infections are driven by social vulnerability and merits further study both in Barranquilla and throughout the tropical and subtropical areas of the world.
