<p>During the last decade, seasonal IAV vaccines have shown a low effectiveness in protecting humans against annual viral infections [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. There are multiple reasons than can affect the efficiencies of LAIV or IIV. (i) The route of administration. LAIV are administered by the intranasal route, mimicking a natural infection, and can establish mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract. On the other hand, IIV are administered intramuscularly, leading to suboptimal induction of immune responses in the mucosa [

 <xref rid="B176-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. (ii) The intrinsic immunogenicity of the vaccine components, mainly the HA protein, can be responsible for the differences observed in the efficacy of seasonal IIV and/or LAIV [

(iii) The emergence of viral strain variants, distinct from the selected vaccine strain, during a given influenza season can result in significant loss of vaccine effectiveness. (iv) The establishment of influenza-specific B- and T-cell memory [
 <xref rid="B178-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Since the MDV of the IAV LAIV remains constant between seasons, and only the viral HA and NA genes are updated, it has been suggested that preexisting immunity to the inteRNAl proteins of the MDV could limit the response to the LAIV, which must replicate in order to be immunogenic and provide protection against subsequent viral infections. In fact, this could be one of the reasons for the low efficacy of LAIV. Understanding how seasonal IAV vaccines are influenced by preexisting immunity will be important for developing the next-generation of IAV vaccines. Moreover, futures strategies to develop new vaccines against IAV, which are highly desired, might require modifying the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 currently used for the preparation of seasonal and pandemic LAIV.
