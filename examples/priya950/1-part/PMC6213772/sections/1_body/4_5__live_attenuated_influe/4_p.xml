<p>The contributions of the different amino acid changes in the polymerase components of the current IAV MDV strains for the ca, ts, and att phenotype have only been partially characterized and their mechanism of attenuation is not entirely understood, but most likely involve multiple steps in the replication cycle of the virus [
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. However, it has been shown that the amino acid substitutions K391E and E581G of the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 used in the US are the major contributors for the ts and att phenotype. In the case of Len/47, the main mutations responsible for that phenotype are amino acid changes in the PB1 (K265N and V591I) and PB2 (V478L) [

 <xref rid="B139-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] or canine (A/canine/NY/dog23/09 H3N8) [

 <xref rid="B127-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] and equine (A/equine/Ohio/03 H3N8) [
 <xref rid="B140-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] influenza viruses, a similar ts and att phenotype was observed in tissue culture cells as well as in an animal models of IAV infection (

 <xref rid="B141-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Significantly, the current commercially available ts, ca H3N8 EIV LAIV, which was developed by passaging the A/equine/Kentucky/1/91 H3N8 in embryonated chicken eggs at gradually reduced temperatures [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>,
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>] have not been updated to match the currently circulating EIV strain. Furthermore, it has been observed that there is not an optimal match of surface antigens between circulating EIV strains and the virus present in the vaccine, leading to a suboptimal protection [
 <xref rid="B144-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>,
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B146-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Moreover, the mutations responsible for the ts, ca, and att phenotype of EIV LAIV have not been yet characterized. However, when we introduced, using reverse genetics approaches, the genetic signature of the US MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 in a more recently circulating EIV strain (A/equine/Ohio/1/03 H3N8) we were able to generate a new and updated EIV LAIV for the prevention and control of currently circulating H3N8 EIV in horse populations (

 <xref rid="B140-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. These data further demonstrate the contribution of the identified amino acid residues in the human US MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 in the ts, ca, and att phenotype but also suggest a common approach to generate new and more efficient LAIV to protect not only humans but also other animals from the devastating effects of IAV infections.
