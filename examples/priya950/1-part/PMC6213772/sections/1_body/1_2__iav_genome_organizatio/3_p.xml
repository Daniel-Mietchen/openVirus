<p>The viral HA, NA, and M2 are structural proteins located in the virion membrane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Influenza viral transcription and replication occurs in the nucleus of infected cells using a unique mechanism among negative-sense RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Upon the release of vRNPs into the cytoplasm of infected cells, vRNPs are transported into the nucleus via a process mediated by the viral NP. Once in the nucleus, the vRNA is used as a template for either transcription into capped and poly-adenylated messenger (m)RNAs [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], or for replication into complementary (c)RNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). New synthetized polymerase PB2, PB1, and PA subunits, and NP are assembled to form cRNPs and the progeny vRNPs, which are produced through replication of the cRNA intermediate. While PB2, PB1, and NP contain nuclear localization signals (NLS), the PA subunit has to be associated with the viral PB1 for its importation into the nucleus of infected cells. Newly generated vRNPs are transported from the nucleus to the cytosol, a process mediated by the nuclear export protein (NEP) and the matrix 1 (M1) protein, and to the plasma membrane where vRNPs are encapsidated in a lipid envelope derived from the infected host plasma membrane. To this end, M1 interacts with the cytoplasmic tails of HA, NA, and M2 and with the membrane itself [

 <xref rid="B73-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Release of newly synthesized virions requires removing SA from glycans on the cellular surface and the newly formed budding virions, a process mediated by the viral NA. Freely, progeny viruses are then able to start a new replication cycle by infecting new target cells [
