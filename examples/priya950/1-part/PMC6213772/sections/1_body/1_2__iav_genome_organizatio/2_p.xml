<p>IAV contains a single-stranded negative-sense viral (v)RNA genome consisting of eight segments that are encapsidated within enveloped spherical or filamentous particles (

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The IAV genome encodes up to 16 different viral proteins using multiple strategies such as overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), alteRNAtive splicing and frameshift mechanisms [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Each of the vRNA segments are flanked at both termini by non-coding regions (NCRs) that serve as polymerase promoters for viral genome replication and gene transcription (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Structurally, the anti-parallel double helices of vRNAs are coated with the viral nucleoprotein (NP) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) to form viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The vRNPs contain a polymerase complex at one end that pseudo-circularizes the vRNA [

 <xref rid="B63-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Although influenza vRNAs are single-stranded, the last nucleotides at their 5′ and 3′ ends are partially complementary and are effectively circularized by being bound to the polymerase complex [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The IAV polymerase complex is a heterotrimeric structure of approximately 270 kilodaltons (kDa) that contains three protein subunits: the polymerase basic 2 and 1 (PB2 and PB1, respectively) and acidic (PA) proteins that, together with the viral NP, allow each vRNP to act as an independent transcription-replication element in infected cells (
