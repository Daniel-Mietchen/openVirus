<p>It is important to highlight that all the described revertant mutants have been generated under laboratory conditions. However, after vaccination, pathogenic revertants from the current MDVs used in the human LAIVs has been not observed, demonstrating that they have a very tested safety profile. Interestingly, the majority of amino acid substitutions identified in both revertant mutants are located in the polymerase complex, indicating that polymerase genes are most crucial in the ts phenotype maintenance of the MDV LAIVs.</p>
