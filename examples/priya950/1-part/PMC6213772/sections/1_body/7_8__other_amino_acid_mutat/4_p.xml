<p>IAV NP is a multifunctional protein that is involved in vRNA nuclear import, viral replication and transcription, and particle encapsidation [

 <xref rid="B163-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. NP amino acid changes have also been involved in ca and/or ts phenotypes [

 <xref rid="B151-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. The new virus contains 14 amino acid changes in the inteRNAl proteins. Two of those mutations were mapped in the NP (G102R and E292G) and using reverse genetics technologies, the authors generated recombinant viruses containing these amino acid substitutions [
 <xref rid="B151-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Then, the viral replication of those viruses was evaluated at different temperatures in embryonated eggs. Reassortants with the reverse mutation G292E in the viral NP were characterized by non-ca and ts phenotype. The introduction of the second reverse mutation R102G, in the context of G292E, completely abolished the virus ca phenotype. Intriguing, viruses with single reverse mutation at amino acid position 102 in NP failed to be rescued [
