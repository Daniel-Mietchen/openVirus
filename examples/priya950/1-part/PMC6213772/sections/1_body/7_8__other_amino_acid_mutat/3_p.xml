<p>Avian IAV are an emerging epidemiological concern. For instance, highly pathogenic avian H5N1 IAV (HPAIV) are continuously circulating in many Asian countries and threatening poultry industry [
 <xref rid="B162-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Although HPAIV do not normally infect humans, some H5N1 strains can cause severe infections in humans with lethality rates of up to 60% [
 <xref rid="B162-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Hence, prophylactic vaccination approaches are the best option to control H5N1 HPAIV infections in poultry and to prevent their transmission to the human population. Zhang et al. generated a recombinant reassortant virus (C4/W1) that contained the NA gene and a modified HA gene from A/chicken/Hubei/327/04 H5N1 (C4), and the six inteRNAl genes from the MDV A/duck/Hubei/W1/04 H9N2 (W1) [

Authors isolated a ts, att C4/W1 virus that provided efficient protection in chickens against H5N1 HPAIV challenge [

These findings demonstrate the potential use of new identified ts and att viruses as well as their respective mutations in the development and implementation of new LAIV to protect against IAV infections, as well as to prevent important economy loss or potential pandemic risks.
