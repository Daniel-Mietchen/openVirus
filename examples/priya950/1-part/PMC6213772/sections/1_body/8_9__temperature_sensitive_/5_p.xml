<p>Recently, the variability of the NS1 protein of circulating IAV H3N2 isolated from infected subjects was analyzed, and multiple amino acid changes were identified [

 <xref rid="B175-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. The consequences of these mutations on the NS1-mediated inhibition of IFN responses and the pathogenesis of the virus were evaluated, showing that some NS1 mutations impaired the ability of the NS1 protein to inhibit host gene expression [

These studies are relevant, not only to generate novel LAIV, but also in order to identify new residues essential for NS1 functions, including the identification of mutations that can be used as risk assessment of circulating pathogenic viruses in the human population [
