<p>Garaigorta et al. identified a ts mutant (named 11C) of A/Victoria/3/75 H3N2 that contained three amino acid changes in the NS1 protein: V18A, R44K, and S195P, which were responsible for the ts phenotype [

 <xref rid="B154-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. However, the mutations had a high impact in virus particle formation, suggesting that NS1 could be involved in the morphogenesis of IAV [

 <xref rid="B126-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], the PR8-11C virus was most attenuated at 39 °C compared to WT PR8, consistent with previous results [

Moreover, a recombinant PR8 virus containing the mutations responsible for the ts, ca, and att phenotype of the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 (PB2 N265S and PB1 K391E, D581G and A661T) alone (PR8 LAIV) or in combination with the 11C mutations in NS1 (PR8 LAIV-11C) [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] was severely impaired to replicate or make plaques at restrictive temperatures (39 °C) as compared to PR8 LAIV, which could likely be attributed to the NS1 11C mutations affecting virus egress/budding [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. In addition, PR8 LAIV-11C showed higher attenuation in vivo than PR8 LAIV, but was able to stimulate similar humoral responses and able to protect against a lethal challenge with the WT PR8 virus than PR8 LAIV [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. These results highlight the possibility to increasing the safety profile of the current MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 LAIV without affecting its immunogenicity and protection efficacy by introducing the NS1 11C mutations [
