<p>The defense mechanisms provided by the host innate immune system restrict IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B170-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Therefore, to efficiently replicate in interferon (IFN)-competent systems, IAV has to regulate the production of IFNs and the activities of IFN-induced proteins that inhibit virus replication [
 <xref rid="B171-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. IAV NS genome segment encodes NS1, which is a multifunctional protein mainly involved in counteract host innate immune responses, modulating virus pathogenesis. Interestingly, it has been described that some mutations in the NS1 protein can confer a ts phenotype to IAV by different mechanisms. In fact, IAV mutants expressing deletions and/or truncations of NS1 show deficiencies in replication at non-permissive temperature (39 Â°C) [
