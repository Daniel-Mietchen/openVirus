<p>M1 is a structural protein of the IAV virion that has multiple functions during viral infection. The dissociation of M1 from vRNP is required for the entry of vRNPs into the cytoplasm of the host cell during initial infection. Moreover, the association of IAV M1 with vRNA and NP is a step indispensable for the formation of vRNP and their nuclear export [

Liu et al. introduced several amino acid substitutions in the backbone of A/WSN/33 to understand the role of the zinc finger motif and the RKLKR domain of M1, both of them involved in RNA binding, during viral assembly and replication [
 <xref rid="B153-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. They observed that modifying the zinc finger motif of IAV M1 reduced viral growth slightly [

Importantly, both substitutions were required to prevent the nuclear localization of M1 at the restricted temperature, while single amino acid substitutions at either position had a minimal effect on the nuclear localization of the viral M1. Likewise, Nogales et al., have shown how the split of the M segment (Ms) of PR8 to produce M1 and M2 from a single transcript rather than alteRNAtive splicing, results in a virus with a ts and att phenotype able to protect against lethal challenge with WT PR8 [

 <xref rid="B169-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>], demonstrating the feasibility of using this split approach of the M segment, alone or in combination with the viral NS, for the development of safe, immunogenic, and protective LAIV [
