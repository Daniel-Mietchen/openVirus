<p>To perform the transcription from vRNA to mRNA, IAV needs to generate primers. IAV polymerase does not have capping activity and it relies on cellular capped RNAs as cap-donors. This process is known as cap-snatching. First, the PB2 CBD binds the nascent host capped RNAs and then the viral PA cleaves the capped RNA using its endonuclease activity [

 <xref rid="B87-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], and RNA synthesis is then completed by the RdRp activity of the IAV PB1 subunit (
