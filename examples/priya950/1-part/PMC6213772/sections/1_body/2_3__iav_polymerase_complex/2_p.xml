<p>The replicase complex core of IAV is formed by the PB1 polymerase subunit together with the C-terminal domain of PA and the N-terminal 35 residues of PB2. This complex has a polymerase core element similar to those of other viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp), although overall it is a much larger enzyme complex with several structured domains outside of this core [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). In a first phase, the influenza viral polymerase complex catalyzes the transcription of vRNA into mRNA using primers generated by the PA subunit from host capped RNAs. For that, the vRNPs associate with the cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II [

 <xref rid="B83-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In a second step, cRNA are generated in a primer-independent mechanism using vRNA as template, and the synthesized viral cRNAs then serve as templates to produce new molecules of vRNA [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). The generated cRNA and vRNA are packaged into new cRNPs or vRNPs, respectively. It has been reported that, during the early stages of viral infection, there is a dominance of mRNAs transcription, with a minority of cRNAs, while at later phases of infection the synthesis of vRNAs increases and becomes the most abundant RNA in infected cells [

Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism that regulates the switch from viral gene transcription to viral genome replication and the recent crystal structure of the viral polymerase will be decisive to understand the machinery of influenza RNA synthesis. The three subunits of the polymerase complex (PB2, PB1, and PA) are multifunctional proteins that carry out the viral genome replication and gene transcription in perfect coordination by regulating their cellular localization and proteinâ€“protein interactions.
