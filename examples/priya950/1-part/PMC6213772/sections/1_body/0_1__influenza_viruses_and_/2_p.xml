<p>IAV are divided into multiple subtypes based on the two glycoproteins located on the surface of the virus, the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) (

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The new generation and implementation of sequencing technologies, as well as the development of better bioinformatics tools, have helped to discover novel subtypes of IAV. Currently, there are 18 HA (H1 to H18) and 11 NA (N1 to N11) IAV subtypes [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, only IAV H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes are presently circulating in humans. IAV are responsible of annual global epidemics, which are most effectively prevented through annual vaccination to reduce transmission and future infections [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The impact of IAV is further intensified by the occurrence of pandemics when novel viruses are introduced into the human population [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is estimated that in about one year, the pandemic 2009 H1N1 IAV infected more than 600,000 individuals around the world, causing near 16,000 human deaths in over 200 countries [
