  <p>Structure of the IAV polymerase complex. The IAV polymerase complex structure is shown in three different views (left to right) rotated by ≈90° between each, and the same coloring is retained in all images (PDB code 4WSB). A dynamic version of this figure where the molecules can be rotated in real time is available online as 
   <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00560">Figure S1</xref>. Panel A shows the PB1 RdRp subunit in grey with its thumb domain colored blue, the active site within conserved motif C shown in magenta, and the 5′ and 3′ RNAs shown in red and orange, respectively. Panel B adds the PB2 subunit in wheat color with its two major domains (RNA and cap binding) indicated. PB2 associates with a large surface on PB1, effectively forming one large globular structure from which the PB2 cap binding and RNA binding domains protrude. Panel C illustrates how the RdRp PA subunit wraps around the PB2-PB1 complex, with its N-terminal endonuclease domain on one side of the complex, the PB1 binding domain forming the major exterior surface of the complex on the other side, and the linker sequence being extended across the PB1 surface. Panel D shows the to-scale structure of the poliovirus polymerase elongation complex, among the smallest single subunit viral polymerases, for size comparison and in the same orientations (PDB code 3OL6).
