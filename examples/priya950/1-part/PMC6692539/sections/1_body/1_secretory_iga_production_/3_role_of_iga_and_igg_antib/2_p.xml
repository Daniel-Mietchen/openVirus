<p>Whereas sIgA antibodies have the role to neutralize potential pathogens at the entrance site before they could attach epithelial cells and overcome the epithelium surface, serum IgA represent “backup” antibodies whose function is to respond in case of systemic infection due to invasion across the mucosal epithelium.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> IgG‐secreting cells are produced in the mucosa‐associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs) and regional lymph nodes. IgG antibodies are secreted in the bloodstream and, reached the mucosal tissues, move via diffusion from the serum to the mucus.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> IgA is characterized by an elevated ability in preventing virus infection, whereas IgG exerts only a marginal role in providing protection toward infections affecting the upper respiratory system. However, IgG antibodies are principally involved in reducing viral pneumonia.
