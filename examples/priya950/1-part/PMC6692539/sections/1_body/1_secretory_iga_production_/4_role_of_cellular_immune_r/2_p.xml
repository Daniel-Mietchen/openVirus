<p>Along with the humoral immunity, also the cell‐mediated immune (CMI) response is activated after influenza infection. Unlike humoral response, capable of neutralizing activity, CMI is able to prevent virus replication and decrease the time for recovery.

 <sup>+</sup> follicular helper T (Th) lymphocytes in presence of antigen‐presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and influenza antigens, induce the differentiation of naïve B cells into IgA‐secreting plasma cells (PCs). sIgA constitute the principal isotype of antibodies present in external secretions, such as nasal fluid, saliva, milk, colostrum intestinal fluid, and gallbladder bile.
