<p>Influenza viruses infect humans through the mucosal epithelium covering the upper respiratory tract; thus, the respiratory epithelium constitutes the site of virus entry, infection, and host immune response (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12664-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Antibodies located on the surface of the mucosa represent the major immune components providing protection against influenza. Upon infection, the human humoral immune response is activated leading principally to the production of local secretory IgA (sIgA) in the mucosa of the upper respiratory system, serum IgA and IgG antibodies.
