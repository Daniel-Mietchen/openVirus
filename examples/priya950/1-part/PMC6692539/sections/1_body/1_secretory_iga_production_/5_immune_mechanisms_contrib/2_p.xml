<p>In influenza‐naive subjects, the clearance of primary viral infection occurs through sIgA and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). More specifically, sIgA appear on day 5 post‐infection, and their level rapidly increases in the nasal wash until day 7‐10 post‐infection, when it reaches a plateau. IgA local immune response persists for a period of 3‐5 months

 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> CTLs appear transiently in the nasal mucosa and peak on day 7 after infection. sIgA have a pivotal role in protecting against influenza infection of the upper respiratory mucosal surfaces, since they can disarm the virus either before it crosses the mucosal barrier
