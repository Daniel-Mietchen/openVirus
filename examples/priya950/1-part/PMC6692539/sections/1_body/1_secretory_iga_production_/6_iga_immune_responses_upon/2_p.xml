<p>On the basolateral surface of the epithelial cells in the lamina propria of mucosal tissue, a polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) links the dimeric IgA (dIgA) and moves to the apical side (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12664-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). During the process of transcytosis across the epithelial cells, polymeric IgA (pIgA) acquires the secretory component (SC), producing sIgA. Secretory component is an unusual extra polypeptide that constitutes the extracellular portion of pIgR upon cleavage by a selective protease.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> The presence of SC provides sIgA a greater functional stability, both by masking the protease sites from proteolytic degradation operated by proteases present in mucosal secretions
