<p>Currently, there are two main methods (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12664-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) of detecting influenza‐specific sIgA responses in nasal wash/swab and saliva samples.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">74</xref>, 
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">75</xref> The two methods differ mainly in terms of the strategy adopted for the standardization of the samples to be analyzed, which precedes influenza‐specific IgA detection. Standardization of the mucosal samples is an important step, since the mucus and protein concentration of nasal washes varies widely between individuals, depending on several factors, such as age, history or concurrence of nasal disease, and aspiration efficacy.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> The first method described here is based on sample standardization according to the total content of IgA present in each sample by using a standardized IgA ELISA kit, whereas the second method is based on the quantification of total protein content through the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12664-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
