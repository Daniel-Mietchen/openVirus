<p>This method is used to normalize the influenza‐specific IgA content of a sample through the total IgA content (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12664-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The total IgA concentration in nasal wash/swab samples or saliva can easily be measured by using one of the many standardized ELISA kits available on the market. Concerning influenza‐specific IgA detection, the procedure needs to be adapted due to the absence of a standardized human influenza‐specific IgA reference. The ELISA procedure in principle has been described elsewhere.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">73</xref> In brief, ELISA plates are coated with an influenza antigen (preferably purified HA) and a capture antibody (anti‐human IgA). Samples and standards are added to the plate and incubated for 1‐2 hours at 37°C. The presence and concentration of influenza‐specific IgA or total IgA is then determined by a color reaction applying an enzyme‐labeled second antibody against human IgA and the respective substrate followed by a read‐out in a conventional microtiter plate ELISA reader. The anti‐influenza IgA concentration is being extrapolated from the standard regression curve derived by diluting a human total IgA reference standard of known starting concentration. As a consequence of this calculation, it is not possible to report the relative value of anti‐influenza IgA as µg; instead, it should be expressed as Unit/mL (U/mL), where 1 U corresponds to 1 µg of human IgA detected. It is important to run multiple samples collected from the same subject at different time points in the same ELISA plate.14 According to this method, the value of influenza‐specific IgA normalized through the total IgA content will be expressed as
