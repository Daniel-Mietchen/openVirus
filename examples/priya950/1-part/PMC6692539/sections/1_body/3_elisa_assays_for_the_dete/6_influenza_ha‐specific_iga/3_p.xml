<p>The first method will be applied if the total protein of the samples is higher than or equal to 1 mg/mL by standardization of nasal or saliva samples to a defined total protein content (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12664-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) which may vary according to the type of sample (nasal wash vs nasal swab vs saliva). The influenza‐specific IgA antibody titer is then calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that yields an OD signal greater than or equal to a predefined cutoff value. However, since completely negative human nasal samples are usually not available, the exact calculation of a cutoff may not be optimal and require alternative approaches in the future.
