<p>Although LAIVs have been on the global market for many years, no established correlates of protection for them are yet available.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">77</xref> Moreover, previously reported discrepancies of efficacy data from Europe and the US further complicate the understanding of the immune response elicited by LAIV.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">77</xref> Despite these complications, great efforts have been made in the recent years to develop novel intranasally administered vaccines to promote influenza virus‐specific sIgA,

A robust mucosal response is fundamental in order to protect both the single individual and the entire population by preventing transmission of the virus to susceptible subjects.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">89</xref> Notably, the use of the ELISA assay for IgA detection could play a major role in the evaluation of vaccine efficacy or effectiveness in the field, as currently influenza vaccine efficacy is traditionally assessed by means of serological assays that detect influenza‐specific serum antibodies induced by the vaccine itself. However, these assays cannot be properly applied to intranasal vaccines, which mainly induce local immune responses (rev. in
