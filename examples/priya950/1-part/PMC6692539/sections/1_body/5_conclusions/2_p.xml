<p>Influenza vaccines elicit protective immunity before a new influenza virus variant is able to spread; they therefore constitute a primary protection tool. Although the main protective effectors against influenza virus infection are CTLs, IgG, and IgA located in the respiratory mucosa, most of the vaccines currently available are inactivated vaccines that are administered via parenteral injection, and which mostly promote serum IgG rather than mucosal IgA (rev. in

They mimic the natural encounter with the antigen by activating the innate immune system and promoting antibody and T cell–mediated immune responses. This type of vaccine can induce a broader immune response in children than intramuscular vaccines.
