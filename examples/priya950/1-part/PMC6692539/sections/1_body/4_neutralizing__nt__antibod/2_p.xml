However, it has been shown in a previous pediatric study with LAIV that influenza virus–specific salivary IgA levels correlated with serum HI responses,

 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">77</xref> NT antibodies in serum samples are usually assessed by means of the microneutralization (MN), either CPE (cytopathic effect)‐based

 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> or the plaque‐reduction neutralization (PRNT) assay. In the present review, we focused on the CPE‐based MN assay, since this is the preferred method because of its simplicity of execution, its ability to evaluate large numbers of samples, and the standardization of the quantity of virus used in the assay.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">78</xref> Along with the ELISA sIgA assay, the MN assay constitutes a valid approach to evaluate the immunogenicity of LAIVs, IIVs, or recombinant influenza vaccines (eg rHA) in inducing selective anti‐influenza antibodies with influenza virus–neutralizing potential.
