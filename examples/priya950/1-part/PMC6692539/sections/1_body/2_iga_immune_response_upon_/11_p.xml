<p>The persistence of protective mucosal immune responses upon LAIV immunization has been investigated in several studies. Murphy and Clements
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> found elevated levels of IgA that recognize HA, and reduced levels of IgM and IgG, in nasal washes obtained from naïve children infected 2 weeks earlier by means of attenuated A viruses. In about 50% of the vaccinees, IgA and IgG in the nasal wash persisted for 1 year. Subsequent studies confirmed the persistence of long‐term (at least 1 year) immunological memory following LAIV vaccination
