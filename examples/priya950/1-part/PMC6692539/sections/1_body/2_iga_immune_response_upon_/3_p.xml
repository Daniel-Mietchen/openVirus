<p>While natural infection is able to induce both mucosal and systemic heterosubtypic responses, the immunity induced by parenterally application of inactivated influenza vaccines is generally virus subtype‐specific.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> In pre‐immunized subjects, the natural contact with the pathogen causes a rapid synthesis of IgA and IgG by B memory cells already 3 days after infection. These immunoglobulins form Ig‐virus complexes which result in virus inactivation.
