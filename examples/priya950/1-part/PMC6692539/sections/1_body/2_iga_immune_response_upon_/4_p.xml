<p>In recent years, an increasing number of pre‐clinical and clinical studies have been performed which have led to a better understanding how mucosal antibodies could be elicited by intranasal vaccination with live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). Live attenuated influenza vaccines is administered as a nasal spray and contains a cold‐adapted (ca) live attenuated influenza virus which, in contrast to wild‐type viruses, is able to replicate well at lower temperatures (around 25°C) and as such only in the upper respiratory tract, but not at higher temperatures (37°C) which does not allow replication in the lower respiratory tract including the lungs. Such property does not allow the ca virus to replicate in lung tissues or cause the onset of influenza‐like illness.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> LAIVs have been introduced firstly by Russia.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> They have been used in adults since the 1950s, and from 1987 onwards, the use of Russian LAIV for the prophylaxis of influenza has been widely extended to all age groups including children aged over 3 years.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> LAIVs have been licensed in the Unites States (US) in 2003 for healthy subjects aged 2‐49 years and in the European Union (EU) in 2012 for healthy children aged 2‐17 years.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> Whereas some countries, including Russia, have licensed only trivalent LAIVs (T‐LAIVs), recently a quadrivalent LAIV (Q‐LAIV) vaccine (MedImmune/AstraZeneca) has been introduced in other countries, such as the US (since 2012), Canada (since 2013), and EU (since 2015), under the trade names FluMist™ in the US and Canada, and Fluenz
