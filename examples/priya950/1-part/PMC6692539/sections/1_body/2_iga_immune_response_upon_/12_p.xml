<p>Clinical Studies have shown that protection after LAIV vaccination is correlated with local anti‐hemagglutinin (HA) IgA and anti‐neuraminidase antibodies in serum,

These antibodies derive from plasma through a process of passive transudation following a concentration gradient between plasma and nasal IgG.
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">60</xref> The substantial differences in the presence of anti‐viral IgA and IgG antibodies in nasal washes or serum of individuals vaccinated either with LAIV or with IIV indicate that these two vaccines are inducing fundamentally different immune responses resulting in different mechanisms of protection. Whereas the protection of the upper respiratory tract is provided mainly by IgA with IgG playing a minor part, the latter play a pivotal role in the protection of the lungs.

 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">62</xref> These differences in the specific immune responses have been confirmed by the recent meta‐analysis of the group of Wen et al
 <xref rid="irv12664-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">62</xref> which identified 191 and 195 differentially expressed genes in IIV and LAIV recipients, respectively. Whereas IIV induced the up‐regulation of genes associated with both the innate immune response and the humoral immune response, LAIV mostly elicited the innate immunity.
