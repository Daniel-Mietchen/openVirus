  <p>Simplified scheme of immune responses following influenza virus infection of the upper respiratory tract with focus on induction and mode of action of secreted IgA (sIgA). Abbreviations: B cell, B lymphocyte; DCs, dendritic cells; dIgA, dimeric IgA; IgA, immunoglobulin A; IgG, immunoglobulin G; MALT, mucosa‐associated lymphoid tissue; PCs, plasma cells; pIgR, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR); T cell, T lymphocyte. Influenza viruses infect epithelial cells of the mucosa and induce mucosal immune responses. Mucosal immune system consists of two sites. Inductive site (MALT) for antigen uptake by DCs and priming of T and B cells for IgA antibody production. Effector site with IgA‐secreting PCs. DCs take up exogenous virus antigens (from virus particles or apoptotic infected cells) by endocytosis and activate naïve T and B cells. PCs secrete IgA antibodies. IgG antibodies transude from the serum to the mucus by diffusion and provide protection against homologous influenza viruses. dIgA are actively transcytosed across epithelial cells via pIgR and provide protection against homologous and heterologous influenza viruses. dIgA can bind to newly synthesized viral proteins within virus‐infected epithelial cells and prevent virus</p>
