<p>All 13 DENV-2 isolates that came from Xishuangbanna belong to the Cosmopolitan genotype and formed two clades in the phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Most of the strains are highly similar to the strains circulating in Vietnam and the Chinese strains, and share 98.8% nucleotide identity with strains previously isolated in Yunnan. To identify amino acid variation that could potentially influence the DENV-2 virulence profile of DENV-2, we compared the complete envelope protein gene sequence with KX577705, which was isolated in Yunnan in 2015. One amino acid substitution (D215N) in 5 of 13 isolates was observed (
