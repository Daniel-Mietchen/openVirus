<p>We observed that the viremia levels were higher among patients who tested negative for IgM antibodies compared with the IgM positive ones. The presence of DENV specific IgM antibodies may help with virion clearance through their uptake by phagocytes, a possibility consistent with the results from a previous study which indicated that IgM promote the clearance and limit dissemination of pathogens [

It was interesting to find that the viremia level in the DENV-1 positive Guangzhou patients was one log higher than that of the Xishuangbanna patients, suggesting that this difference is genotype-specific or is related to the host genetic background.
