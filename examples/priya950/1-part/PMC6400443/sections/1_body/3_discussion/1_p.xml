<p>Dengue fever is an acute, emerging infectious disease caused by DENV, which is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes causing around 50â€“100 million disease cases every year, and with its associated high morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries, poses a great threat to public health worldwide [

Since the 1990s, dengue epidemics have spread gradually from the south-eastern coastal regions to the northern and western regions of China and have become endemic in the south-eastern coastal regions and sporadic in the inner land.
