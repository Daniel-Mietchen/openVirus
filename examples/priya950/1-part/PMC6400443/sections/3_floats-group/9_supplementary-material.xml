  <title>Comparative analyses of amino acid substitutions among 4 strains of DENV-2.</title>
  <p>There were a total of 13 samples of DENV-2 serotype, and all of them came from Yunnan. Nucleotide alignment indicated: 4 isolates were consistent named as DENV-2 (1), 7 isolates were consistent named as DENV-2 (2), 1 isolate named as DENV-2 (3), 1 isolate named as DENV-2(4). The nucleotide sequence consistency (identity position) of 4 groups was 99.8%. When comparing amino acid, the consistency of DENV-2(2), DENV-2(4), and KX577705 was 100%. Amino acid consistency of DENV-2(1) and DENV-2(3) was 100%, but amino acid consistency of DENV-2(2), DENV-2(4), and KX577705 was 98.8%. At the 215th position, DENV-2(1) andDENV-2(3) amino acids were N-asparagine, DENV-2(2), DENV-2(4) and KX577705 were D aspartic acid.</p>
