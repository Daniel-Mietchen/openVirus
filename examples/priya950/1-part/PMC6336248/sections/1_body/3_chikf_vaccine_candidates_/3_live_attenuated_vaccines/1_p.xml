<p>A serially passaged, empirically live-attenuated candidate vaccine called strain 181/clone25 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was eventually evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]: all vaccinated individuals developed neutralizing antibodies but 8% of them experienced mild, transient joint pain, a common symptom of CHIKF. The occurrence of arthralgia suggested insufficient and/or unstable attenuation; later studies indicated that the 181/clone25 attenuation is mediated by only two point mutations, which can revert following vaccination [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In other studies, seroconversion rates were low among those who had been previously vaccinated with other live-attenuated alphavirus vaccines (i.e., Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), suggesting immunological interference [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Ultimately, development of this live-attenuated vaccine was discontinued not only because of reactogenicity and the absence of widespread and well-documented outbreaks but also due to the scarcity of funding and concerns regarding marketing [
