<p>Another unique viral-vectored vaccine, EILV/CHIKV, was developed based on the insect-specific alphavirus, Eilat (EILV), which is completely defective for replication in vertebrate cells [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. When chimerized to replace the Eilat structural polyprotein open reading frame (ORF) with that of CHIKV, the host restriction remains, as indicated by a complete lack of RNA genome replication and virus production in several vertebrate cell lines as well as in serial passages in infant, immunodeficient mouse brains, the most permissive vertebrate environment for most alphaviruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006919.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A single dose of this replication-deficient vaccine produced in mosquito cells protects mice and NHPs from all measures of disease and viremia, with murine protection extending beyond 9 months. This remarkable immunogenicity (single dose of a replication-defective vaccine) is mediated, at least in part, but the normal endocytic pathway of the vaccine particles, which are structurally identical to wild-type CHIKV.
