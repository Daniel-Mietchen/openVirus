to clinical complications that had never been associated with ZIKV before.
Adaptive mutations could have contributed to the successful emergence of
ZIKV as a global health threat to a nonimmune population. However, the
causal relationships between the ZIKV genetic determinants, the pathogenesis
and the rapid spread in Latin America and in the Caribbean remain widely
unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>OBJECTIVES</title><p> The aim of this study was to characterise three ZIKV isolates obtained from
patient samples during the 2015/2016 Brazilian epidemics.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><p> The ZIKV genomes of these strains were completely sequenced and <italic>in
vitro</italic> infection kinetics experiments were carried out in cell
lines and human primary cells.</p></sec><sec><title>FINDINGS</title><p> Eight nonsynonymous substitutions throughout the viral genome of the three
Brazilian isolates were identified. Infection kinetics experiments were
carried out with mammalian cell lines A549, Huh7.5, Vero E6 and human
monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDCs) and insect cells (Aag2, C6/36 and
AP61) and suggest that some of these mutations might be associated with
distinct viral fitness. The clinical isolates also presented differences in
their infectivity rates when compared to the well-established ZIKV strains
(MR766 and PE243), especially in their abilities to infect mammalian
cells.</p></sec><sec><title>MAIN CONCLUSIONS</title><p> Genomic analysis of three recent ZIKV isolates revealed some nonsynonymous
substitutions, which could have an impact on the viral fitness in mammalian
and insect cells.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>Zika virus</kwd><kwd>Flavivirus</kwd><kwd>molecular markers</kwd><kwd>biological characterisation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="30"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>ZIKV is a flavivirus (belonging to the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus
<italic>Flavivirus</italic>) that has recently emerged in many countries and has
triggered an epidemic in the human population. For decades, human infections were only
sporadic; however, outbreaks were noted in Yap Island in 2007 and in the Pacific Islands
in 2013,<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> and an explosive epidemic occurred in Brazil in 2015.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>Prior to 2007, ZIKV had silently circulated in many countries from African and Asian
continents with a low impact on public health. However, during the recent emergence,
different transmission routes have been reported, and the epidemic profile and
self-limiting character of Zika disease were dramatically altered.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> After ZIKV introduction to Brazil, the virus raged on in South America and
caused debilitating neurological and congenital complications, resulting in significant
acute morbidity in adult patients and devastating neurological sequelae in
newborns.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>As evidenced for other arthropod-borne viruses, a combination of factors ranging from
environmental factors to viral genetic changes may have contributed to the selection and
spread of new epidemic variants of ZIKV through a na&#x000ef;ve population in tropical and
subtropical areas. Currently, the occurrence of human ZIKV infections has dramatically
decreased in Latin America. This decrease may be partially due to the population&#x02019;s
previous experience with natural ZIKV infection and the subsequent development of
immunity.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> Additionally, other seasonal changes can influence the biology of vectors and
can affect host-pathogen interactions; this generates a variation in the timing and
severity of epidemic dynamics, as has been demonstrated by studies on other infectious
agents.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref> Although a decrease in ZIKV transmission has been observed in the last two
years, human cases are sporadically detected, which highlights the possibility of a new
epidemic event. Clarifying the dynamic of ZIKV infections between animals, human hosts
and vectors should aid in preventing new epidemic outbreaks and in developing strategies
for controlling ZIKV infections.</p><p>The ZIKV genome consists of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of approximately 11 kb in
length. The viral RNA architecture is composed of two noncoding regions at the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019;
extremities flanking a single open reading frame (ORF). The viral ORF encodes a
polyprotein that, after cleavage by viral and host cell proteases, generates three
structural proteins [capsid (C), premembrane (prM) and envelope (E)] that constitute the
viral particle and encode seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B
and NS5) that are mainly involved in viral replication and immune system evasion.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>Phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that after ZIKV emerged in Uganda, the virus
spread independently and evolved into three lineages (west African, east African, and
Asian) that appear to be related to distinct clinical complications in the human
host.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> In accordance, ZIKV genomic characterisation suggests that during the
geographical spread, the Asian lineage has accumulated several mutations that might have
influenced the fitness and increased the virulence and the occurrence of new clinical
entities associated with the ZIKV infections during the 2015/2016 outbreak.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>A better understanding of the contribution of viral genetic markers to human disease and
the viral spread in nature might be of paramount importance to design prophylactic or
therapeutic strategies to control ZIKV infections. Here, we describe the isolation and
present a comparative genetic and biological characterisation of three Brazilian ZIKV
clinical isolates selected from two different epidemic periods. Sequence alignment and
phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the isolates reported in this manuscript belong
to the Asian lineage. We identified nonsynonymous mutations in the genomes of these
Brazilian ZIKV isolates and the biological characterisations of the viruses showed that
the mammalian cell lines were more permissive to ZIKV infections than the insect cell
lines.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>

<italic>ZIKV isolation and sequencing</italic> -The serum samples were obtained from
two patients living in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte state (RN)/Northern Brazil
(latitude: 05&#x000ba; 47&#x02019; 51&#x02019;&#x02019; S; longitude: 35&#x000ba; 13&#x02019; 34&#x02019;&#x02019; W) in March (strain ZV BR

the outbreak in Brazil. The other sample (strain ZV BR 2016/16288) was obtained from
a patient living in Teut&#x000f4;nia in Rio Grande do Sul state (RS)/South Brazil (latitude:

were shown to have identical sequences to the viruses that were previously sequenced
from the P0 and patient sera, respectively; these sequences have been previously
deposited (GenBank accession numbers MF073357 and MF073358). ZV BR 2015/15098 P3 was
submitted to the GenBank database under the accession number MK566202.</p><p>
<italic>Sequence analyses</italic> - Two different datasets were used for the
phylogenetic analysis. For dataset 1, only the sequences with 100% query coverage in
a Blast (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) search using ZV BR 2016/16288 as
the query were selected. The sequences were aligned using ClustalW as implemented in
BioEdit version 7.2.6.1 and were manually edited in the ORF region to avoid codon
disruption by inserted gaps. Dataset 2 comprised sequences presenting 100% query
coverage in a Blast search using ZV BR 2016/16288 ORF as the query. The sequences
were codon aligned using Muscle as implemented in MEGA 7.0.26. Redundant sequences,
sequences which presented no information regarding the country or collection date,
and the sequences of synthetic constructs were excluded from both datasets. RDP4
Beta 4.97 was used to identify potential recombinants and to exclude them from the
alignment as described in. ModelGenerator v0.85 was used for the selection of a
nucleotide substitution model. Phylogenetic tree inference was performed in MrBayes
v.3.2.6. using three hot chains and one cold chain and was run for 1 million
(dataset 1) or 6 million (dataset 2) generations with a 25% burn-in. FigTree v.1.4.3
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) and Inkscape 0.92 were used to edit the
tree. The HMMTOP tool (http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/), which was run with the default
settings, was used for the prediction of the transmembrane helices in the NS2A
protein. The hydrophobicity plot of the NS4B protein was computed using the
ProtScale tool (https://web.expasy.org/protscale/) based on a Kyte &#x00026; Doolittle
scale with the default settings. For the RNA secondary structure prediction in the
3&#x02019;UTR, the mfold web server
(http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form) was used with the default
settings. Only the highest revised free energy structure is presented.</p><p>
<italic>In vitro kinetics infection</italic> - To perform the biological
characterisation studies of recent ZIKV clinical isolates we used two
well-characterised ZIKV strains, MR766 and PE243, as reference viruses. The African
ZIKV MR766 strain (GenBank accession number NC_012532) was originally isolated in
1947 from a rhesus monkey. The Asian ZIKV PE243 (GenBank accession number KX197192)
was isolated in Recife from a patient with classical symptoms of ZIKV infection in
2015. The ZIKV strains ZV BR 2015/15098, ZV BR 2015/15261, ZV BR 2016/16288, MR766
and PE243 were used to infect mammalian (Vero E6, Huh7.5 and A549 cell lines seeded
into 96-well plates at densities of 1.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) and insect
(Aag-2, AP61 and C6/36 cell lines seeded into 96-well plates at densities of 1.5 x
10<sup>4</sup>, 3 x 10<sup>4</sup> and 8 x 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well,
respectively) cells at an MOI of 0.1 and 1 for one hour. After, the viral inoculum
was removed followed by the addition of the appropriate media. The percentage of
infected cells was evaluated 24, 48 and 72 hours post infection (h.p.i.) by indirect
immunofluorescence using an anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody (mAb 4G2; ATCC
HB-112). The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. The images were obtained with the
Operetta CLS high-content imaging system (PerkinElmer) with a 20x objective and were
quantified using Harmony software (PerkinElmer).</p><p>
<italic>Virus biological characterisation</italic> - Initially, an infection
kinetics assay was performed using the MOIs of 0.1 and 1 for 24, 48 and 72 h.p.i to
select the best time point and MOI to carry the biological characterisation
experiments in the different cell lines. Vero E6, Huh7.5 and A549 cells were
infected with the ZIKV strains using an MOI of 0.1 and a period of incubation of 48
h. AP61 and C6/36 cells were infected with the ZIKV strains using an MOI of 1 and a
period of incubation of 72 h. The cells were plated in 96 well plates, and after the
period of incubation, the cells were fixed with methanol:acetone (v/v). The
expression of viral E protein was analysed by immunofluorescence using an
anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody (mAb 4G2), as described above. In addition, the
same infection was performed in 24 well plates. The cell supernatants were collected
for virus titration by focus-forming assay, and the total RNA was extracted from
cells for subsequent ZIKV genome RNA quantification. For all the experiments, the
mock-infected cells were used as the negative control for the infection. The
statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey&#x02019;s multiple
comparisons test. The differences were considered significant at p &#x02264; 0.05.</p><p>

plates and were incubated for 1 h 30 min with ZV BR 2015/15098, ZV BR 2015/15261, ZV
BR 2016/16288, ZIKV PE243 and ZIKV MR766 at an MOI of 10. After removal of the
inoculum, the cells were washed with PBS and were incubated with fresh medium for 24
h at 37&#x000ba;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For the negative control (mock), mdDCs were
incubated with uninfected C6/36 cell culture supernatants. The cell-free
supernatants were collected for virus titration by focus-forming assays and the
total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets (RNeasy mini kit - Qiagen) to quantify
the ZIKV genomic RNA. The ZIKV infections of mdDCs were evaluated by flow cytometry
using anti-human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as follows: anti-CD11c-PE-Cy5,
CD14-BV450 and CD209-APC (BD Pharmingen, CA, USA) and their respective isotype
controls. For intracellular ZIKV envelope protein detection, the mdDCs were
permeabilised with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and were stained with 4G2-FITC
at 1:200 (v/v) in Perm/Wash buffer. The cell suspensions were acquired in a
FACSCanto II instrument (BD Biosciences) and were analysed by FlowJo software,
version 10.0.7 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). The dendritic cells were first gated
as CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>-</sup> cells and then were gated as
CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD209<sup>+</sup> cells; finally, 4G2<sup>+</sup> cells show
the frequency of infected cells. The statistical analyses were performed using PRISM
(version 7.0; GraphPad, San Diego, USA). The significance was determined using a
paired, nonparametric test (Wilcoxon) among different stimulations in the same
group. The values of p &#x02264; 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The ZIKV isolates reported in this study were obtained from the sera of three

extensively studied and well-characterised ZIKV strains such as MR766 and PE243,
different mammalian and insect cell lines were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). This kinetics analysis was also used to choose the best time
and MOI to observe the differences between the virus isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). A period of incubation of 48 h and a MOI of 0.1 for the
mammalian cell lines (A549, Huh7.5 and Vero E6), and 72 h and an MOI of 1 for the
insect cell lines (AP61 and C6/36) were selected. Further studies with Aag2 were not
carried out after this cell line was demonstrated to have low susceptibility to the
ZIKV isolates tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>B).</p><p>

three Brazilian ZIKV isolates (ZV BR 2015/15098, ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR
2016/16288) had lower percentages of infected cells, RNA accumulation and viral
progeny production in A549 and Huh7.5 cells. In Vero E6 cells, this difference was
confirmed by analysing the percentage of infected cells and the titers of viral
particles released; however, this was not the case for RNA accumulation. Our results
show that the genomic RNA accumulation is higher during MR766 infection compared to
the three recent Brazilian ZIKV strains in A549 and Huh7.5 cells at 48 h.p.i.
However, in Vero E6 cells, the viral RNA levels were similar among the strains
studied. The differences between the Brazilian ZIKV isolates and the MR766 and PE243
strains were less evident in the infected insect cells.</p><p>

</p><p>Comparisons between the three newly described isolates showed that ZV BR 2015/15098
had the highest infection rate in A549 cells and the highest viral progeny
production rates in A549 and Huh7.5 cells. On the other hand, viral RNA accumulation
was not significantly different in those cells.</p><p>Aiming to evaluate the ability of different ZIKV isolates from Brazil to infect a
primary human cell target, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDC) were used. After
a 24 h infection period, it was possible to demonstrate the presence of envelope
protein (4G2<sup>+</sup>) of ZIKV in mdDCs infected with the three clinical isolates
of ZIKV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>A-B). Flow cytometry analysis
showed that the frequency of mdDCs
(CD11c<sup>+</sup>/CD14<sup>-</sup>/CD209<sup>+</sup>) infected
(4G2<sup>+</sup>) with ZV BR 2015/15261 (25.54% &#x000b1; 21.12) was similar to the
frequency of infection with ZIKV PE243 (27.47% &#x000b1; 16.98) and ZIKV MR766 (24.84% &#x000b1;
20.49). Conversely, the ZIKV strains ZV BR 2015/15098 (8.31% &#x000b1; 6.29), that presented
a better viral fitness on A459, Huh7.5 and Vero E6 cells, as well as the ZV BR
2016/16288 (10.40% &#x000b1; 6.03), were shown to be less efficient in infecting mdDCs
compared to the infection efficiencies of the ZV BR 2015/15261, PE243 and MR766
strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>A-B). Unlike the high infection
rates observed after 48 h in mammalian cells or 72 h in insect cells, the mdDC
infection rates with all ZIKV strains tested decreased over time (data not shown).
The virus titration of cell culture supernatants confirmed the results of the
abilities of viruses to replicate and release infective particles in cell
supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>C). Corroborating the flow
cytometry data, ZV BR 2015/15261, MR766 and PE243 showed higher titers compared to

part the results with primary human mdDCs cells were divergent from the results
observed in the mammalian cell lines. Despite lower viral fitness in A549 and Huh7.5
cells, ZV BR 2015/15261 strain displayed the highest infectivity rates in the mdDC
compared to others ZV BR 2015/15098 and ZV BR 2016/16288 strains. In contrast, ZV BR
2015/15098 that displayed the highest infection rates in A549 and Huh7.5 cells, it
has low productive infection in mdDC. As a whole, however, the reference ZIKV
strains, MR766 and PE243, and ZV BR 2016/16288 showed the same pattern of infection
in both mammalian and mdDC cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Phylogenetic studies support the idea that throughout its evolution, the
single-stranded positive-sense RNA ZIKV has accumulated genetic changes that may
have ensured some selective advantage for virus adaptation and recent epidemic
spread of ZIKV Asian lineage. Several studies have experimentally investigated the
role of some of these amino acid substitutions, and a correlation between genetic
changes and the increased pathogenicity of ZIKV in recent outbreaks was

HMMTOP (http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/), this mutation (A175V) maps to a transmembrane
domain. The NS2A mutation M181V (between ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR 2015/15098 or ZV
BR 2016/16288 - <xref rid="t3" ref-type="table">Table III</xref>) maps to this same
domain. The nature of the mutation is also similar, resulting in just a small
increase in the amino acid side chain. The amino acid polymorphism identified in ZV
BR 2015/15098 NS2A<sub>117</sub> presents the same character as minor variants
previously identified at this same position through next-generation sequencing.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref> There are five other isolates (KX520666/BR/2015, KY648934/MX/2016,
KX446951/MX/2016, MH900227/MX/2016 and KX377336/MY/1966) in our datasets that
contain this same substitution (A117V). Based on the homology and the <italic>in
silico</italic> prediction, this mutation also maps to a transmembrane domain,
and the only amino acids identified at this position are either alanine or valine.
Additionally, when the UTRs of the three new ZIKV isolates were compared, one single
nucleotide change downstream of the stop codon of the NS5 gene was detected in the
ZIKV ZV BR 2015/15098 strain. This mutation was mapped to the highly variable
proximal region 1 of the 3&#x002b9;UTR sequence (3&#x002b9;HVR), a region of the Flavivirus genome
known for displaying large heterogeneity in both sequence and length.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref> The flavivirus 3&#x02019;UTR contains essential elements that function as important
mediators to promote viral genome replication and translation. Despite this, the
nucleotide change at 3&#x02019;HVR of the ZV BR 2015/15098 does not seem to have any impact
on the secondary structure, as shown in the RNA fold analysis
(<inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="1678-8060-mioc-114-e190150-s.pdf" id="d35e1084" content-type="local-data">Supplementary

demonstrated that sequence variability at 3&#x02019;HVR of DENV-1 and DENV-2 are associated
with DENV fitness gain or loss in mammalian and insect cells.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>To evaluate the synergistic effect of the mutations identified in each Brazilian ZIKV
isolate, we first compared the ability of recent ZIKV isolates and a representative
of the African ZIKV lineage to infect mammalian and insect cells. We observed that
the ZIKV prototypes (MR766 and PE243) exhibit more protein expression and viral
particle production than the recent ZIKV isolates in all mammalian cells tested.
However, among the recent isolates, the ZV BR 2015/15098 showed higher infective
ability, especially in A549 and Huh7.5 cells. Nonetheless, in insect cells these
differences were not so evident. Interestingly, ZV BR 2015/15098 has the NS2A
(A117V) polymorphism. Another Brazilian isolate with this same polymorphism
(KX520666/BR/2015) has been reported to have higher cytopathogenicity and a higher
viral progeny production in different mammalian cell lines (Vero, HEK293T and
SH-SY5Y) compared to a virus representative of the early Asian lineage (KF993678).
Viral RNA accumulation was also higher in the Vero and HEK293T cells, but no
difference was observed in SH-SY5Y cells.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>Additionally, we observed that ZV BR 2016/16288, the isolate circulating in southern
Brazil one year after the detection of the first case of ZIKV in Brazil, is less
infective when compared with the ZIKV prototypes and the 2015 isolates in all cell
lineages tested in this study, except in C6/36 cells. In this cell line, the
low-passage strain ZV BR 2016/16288 showed very similar viral growth when compared
with the other two recent ZIKV isolates. The ZIKV ZV BR 2016/16288 showed one
nonconservative point mutation at residue 26 of the N-terminal region of the NS4B
protein (<xref rid="t3" ref-type="table">Table III</xref>) and one point mutation at
residue 349 of NS1 protein that should play an important role in ZIKV infectivity,
live virus release and viral RNA replication. NS1 protein is a secreted glycoprotein
involved in viral replication and immune evasion during flaviviral infection.
Further, one non-synonymous mutation at NS1 associated with a single mutation at E
protein in a ZIKV strain was found to alter viral fitness in cell culture and
pathogenesis in mice.<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref> On the other hand, although the exact topology of flavivirus integral
membrane-NS4B on the host membrane compartment is not totally clear, previous
studies have shown that the 30 N-terminal residues of NS4B form a dynamic structure
that is not associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">

characteristics of NS4B&#x02019;s N-terminal helix have critical implication for RNA
replication. The presence of the threonine residue at NS4B<sub>26</sub> could
disrupt the amphipathic nature of the NS4B helix and impact on NS4B functions in
distinct cell lines [<inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="1678-8060-mioc-114-e190150-s.pdf" id="d35e1138" content-type="local-data">Supplementary

<bold>(Fig. 2)</bold>].</p><p>By analysing the percentage of cells expressing the E viral protein and production of
progeny virus in infected cell lineages we can observe that the mammalian cells are,
in general, more susceptible than the <italic>Aedes</italic> cells to the tested
ZIKV strains. It is important to emphasize that all three recent ZIKV isolates
presented similar profiles of patterns of focus formation in mosquito C6/36 cells;
however, in Vero E6 cells, the ZV BR 2015/15098 strain exhibited larger plaque
morphology when compared with the smaller plaque phenotype of ZV BR 2015/15261 and
ZV BR 2016/16288 (data not shown). These differences can be attributed to the
patterns of virus-host interactions in distinct susceptible cell types. Given the
observed genotypic and phenotypic differences among the ZIKV isolates, the
variations in the amino acid composition of ZIKV proteins could influence the manner
by which the viral components interact with host cell, and thus, can modulate their
infectivity in different cell substrates.</p><p>Human dendritic cells play an important role in antigen presentation to T cells and
are also the first target cells of dengue virus after virus infection by a mosquito
bite in the skin. It was recently shown that human epidermal keratinocytes, dermal
fibroblasts and mdDCs<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref> are also susceptible to ZIKV infection <italic>in vitro</italic>. Several
receptors are involved in ZIKV infection, such as AXL, Tyro3, TIM-1, and DC-SIGN,
which is mainly expressed on dendritic cells and is also known as CD209.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref> An analysis of the patients&#x02019; blood cells infected by ZIKV revealed that
monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells were the main infected cell types; these cell
types supported virus replication, and as circulating cells, they could transport
the virus to different tissues and fluids.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref> To characterise the infective profile of the different ZIKV strains in a
more relevant cell type in ZIKV pathogenesis, we infected the human mdDCs primary
cells. In this cellular model, ZV BR 2015/15261 has showed the better viral fitness
when compared to the other recent isolates in contrast to the results observed in
the experiments carried using mammalian cell lineages. The higher E protein
synthesis, live virus release, and viral RNA level production in human mdDcs for the
ZV BR 2015/15261 compared to ZV BR 2015/15098 and ZV BR 2015/16288 isolates suggests
that T30I, I34T and M181V polymorphisms in NS2A and H92Y polymorphism in protease
domain of NS3 protein (<xref rid="t3" ref-type="table">Table III</xref>) may
contribute to both increasing viral fitness and controlling host antiviral response.
The effect of the amino acid substitutions (isolated or in combination) identified
among the ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR 2015/15098 and ZV BR 2016/16288 isolates on the
modulation of the infection rates in different cell substrates deserves further
investigation. It is interesting to note that ZV BR 2015/15261, which presented the
lowest infectivity in mammalian cell lines, was the isolate that presented the
highest infection rates in the mdDCs from healthy donors, which is a more
&#x0201c;physiological&#x0201d; infection model. We speculate that the four amino acid mutations
identified in the NS2A and NS3 proteins that distinguish ZV BR 2015/15261 from the
other two isolates (isolated or synergistically) could result in an increase in
viral fitness during the infection of human dendritic cells.</p><p>In conclusion, we successfully isolated ZIKV from serum samples of patients from two
different periods of the Brazilian epidemic. We observed significant differences
between the clinical isolates and the well-established ZIKV strains (MR766 and
PE243) with an emphasis on the abilities to infect mammalian cells. However, our
comparison is limited due to the long passage history of these prototype strains in
cell culture and/or mice. This reinforces the importance of using isolates with low
numbers of passages to study viral pathogenesis. The mutations on the flavivirus
genome are known to influence the virulence, replication efficiency and
antigen-antibody interaction with the host. In our study, the viral genomes were
fully sequenced and revealed some nonsynonymous substitutions, which could have an
impact on the viral fitness in mammalian and insect cells. Although there is an
increasing amount of data from ZIKV genomic analyses, especially after the 2015/2016
outbreak, there is still a lack of information linking specific amino acid
substitution(s) to viral biological characteristics and fitness. Further studies
using reverse genetics are essential to define the role of the observed mutations in
the differential infection phenotypes observed, especially in human mdDCs. Those
future studies could help the understanding of ZIKV replication efficiency and could
contribute to the studies of viral attenuation strategies that will ideally lead to
vaccine development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>To Dr Giovanny ACA Mazzarotto and the staff for technical support with the animal
