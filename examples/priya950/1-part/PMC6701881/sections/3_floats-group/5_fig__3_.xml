  <title>biological characterisation of different Zika virus (ZIKV) strains in mammalian (A, C, E) and mosquito (B, D, F) cell lines. The mammalian cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 for 48 h; the insect cells were infected at an MOI of 1 for 72 h. (A-B) The frequency of ZIKV-infected cells (4G2
   <sup>+</sup>) was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. (C-D) The ZIKV progeny in the cell culture supernatant from the ZIKV-infected cells was quantified using a focus-forming assay in C6/36 cells. (E-F) The ZIKV replication was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on the ZIKV-infected cells. The ZIKV E RNA was quantified using the housekeeping genes RNase P (E) or 18S rRNA (F) for normalisation (2
   <sup>-ΔCT</sup>). The data were analysed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. The bars show the mean values ± SD from three independent experiments. * p ≤ 0.05 compared with mock; □ p ≤ 0.05 compared with MR766; ■ p ≤ 0.05 compared with PE243; ○ p ≤ 0.05 compared with ZV BR 2015/15098; ● p ≤ 0.05 p ≤ 0.05 compared with ZV BR 2015/15261.
