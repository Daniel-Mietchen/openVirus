   <italic>in vitro</italic> growth kinetics of Zika virus (ZIKV) isolates in (A) mammalian cell lines (A549, Huh7.5 and Vero E6) and (B) mosquito cell lines (AP61, C6/36 and Aag-2). The cells were infected at an MOI = 0.1 or 1 for 24, 48 and 72 h.p.i. The percentage of infected cells was determined by immunofluorescence using an anti-E protein monoclonal antibody (4G2). The bars represent the means Â± SD. The results are the means from triplicate experiments.
