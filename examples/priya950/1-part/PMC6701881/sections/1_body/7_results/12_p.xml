<p>The abilities of the ZIKV isolates to infect the different cell lines were evaluated based on the percentage of infected cells; this was determined based on the presence of viral E protein, the quantification of viral RNA in infected cells by RT-qPCR, as well as the titration of the cell culture supernatants to access the amount of released infectious viral particles [

However, when compared to the MR766 and PE243 strains, the three Brazilian ZIKV isolates (ZV BR 2015/15098, ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR 2016/16288) had lower percentages of infected cells, RNA accumulation and viral progeny production in A549 and Huh7.5 cells. In Vero E6 cells, this difference was confirmed by analysing the percentage of infected cells and the titers of viral particles released; however, this was not the case for RNA accumulation. Our results show that the genomic RNA accumulation is higher during MR766 infection compared to the three recent Brazilian ZIKV strains in A549 and Huh7.5 cells at 48 h.p.i. However, in Vero E6 cells, the viral RNA levels were similar among the strains studied. The differences between the Brazilian ZIKV isolates and the MR766 and PE243 strains were less evident in the infected insect cells.
