<p>The viruses that were recovered from the cell culture supernatant at passage three were fully sequenced. All ZIKV full-length genome sequencing resulted in a 10,807 nucleotide (nt) assembled sequence; this sequence contained an ORF of 10,269 nucleotides in length with 5สน (107 nt) and 3สน (431 nt) untranslated regions (UTRs). The numbers of nucleotide and amino acid differences among the isolates are shown in
