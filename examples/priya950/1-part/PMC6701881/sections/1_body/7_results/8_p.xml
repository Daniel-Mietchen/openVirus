<p>A genomic analysis comparing the P3 sequences of the two ZIKV isolates recovered from the patients’ serum from the Brazilian northeast region (RN state) obtained during the same epidemic event three months apart (ZV BR 2015/15098 versus ZV BR 2015/15261) was performed; this analysis showed six amino acid substitutions, more specifically in the E, NS2A and NS3 coding regions (

 <xref rid="t3" ref-type="table">III</xref>). The genome of the isolate ZV BR 2016/16288 showed two exclusive amino acid substitutions when compared with the others two isolates studied, mapping at NS1 and NS4B proteins. Additionally, only the ZIKV ZV BR 2015/15098 showed a nucleotide substitution at 3’ UTR. As shown in the RNA fold analysis (
