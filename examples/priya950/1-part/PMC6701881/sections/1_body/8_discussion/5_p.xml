<p>By analysing the percentage of cells expressing the E viral protein and production of progeny virus in infected cell lineages we can observe that the mammalian cells are, in general, more susceptible than the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> cells to the tested ZIKV strains. It is important to emphasize that all three recent ZIKV isolates presented similar profiles of patterns of focus formation in mosquito C6/36 cells; however, in Vero E6 cells, the ZV BR 2015/15098 strain exhibited larger plaque morphology when compared with the smaller plaque phenotype of ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR 2016/16288 (data not shown). These differences can be attributed to the patterns of virus-host interactions in distinct susceptible cell types. Given the observed genotypic and phenotypic differences among the ZIKV isolates, the variations in the amino acid composition of ZIKV proteins could influence the manner by which the viral components interact with host cell, and thus, can modulate their infectivity in different cell substrates.
