<p>Phylogenetic studies support the idea that throughout its evolution, the single-stranded positive-sense RNA ZIKV has accumulated genetic changes that may have ensured some selective advantage for virus adaptation and recent epidemic spread of ZIKV Asian lineage. Several studies have experimentally investigated the role of some of these amino acid substitutions, and a correlation between genetic changes and the increased pathogenicity of ZIKV in recent outbreaks was suggested.

 <sub>2634</sub> (numbering from the start codon of the ZIKV genome) signature characteristic of the American isolates. The substitutions S139N at prM and A982V at NS1 arose during the course of ZIKV spread from Asia to the Americas and were associated with severe microcephalic phenotype in neonatal mouse model and increased virus transmission in mosquitoes, respectively (reviewed by Liu et al.

 </xref> The M/T2634V substitution at NS5 is believed to be more recent and to have a neutral effect on viral fitness, although it has not been thoroughly studied.

 </xref> Apart from these genetic determinants of virulence, we identified a unique mutation in the envelope protein (K166R) in the isolate ZV BR 2015/15098 (
 <xref rid="t3" ref-type="table">Table III</xref>). This substitution is located in domain I of the envelope protein and does not implicate a change in the biochemical characteristics of the amino acid. The only other sequence in our datasets that presented a nonsynonymous substitution (K166E) in this position was an isolate from the Central African Republic (KF383115).
