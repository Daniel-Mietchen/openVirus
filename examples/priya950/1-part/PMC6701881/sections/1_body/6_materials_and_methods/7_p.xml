<p>The ZIKV RNA genomes were assembled using Phred/Phrap/Consed software (http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html), and the polyprotein amino acid sequences and the UTRs were annotated. ZV BR 2016/16288 P3 and ZV BR 2015/15261 P3 were shown to have identical sequences to the viruses that were previously sequenced from the P0 and patient sera, respectively; these sequences have been previously deposited (GenBank accession numbers MF073357 and MF073358). ZV BR 2015/15098 P3 was submitted to the GenBank database under the accession number MK566202.</p>
