<p>For ZIKV infection of mdDCs, 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well were distributed into 96-well plates and were incubated for 1 h 30 min with ZV BR 2015/15098, ZV BR 2015/15261, ZV BR 2016/16288, ZIKV PE243 and ZIKV MR766 at an MOI of 10. After removal of the inoculum, the cells were washed with PBS and were incubated with fresh medium for 24 h at 37ºC in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. For the negative control (mock), mdDCs were incubated with uninfected C6/36 cell culture supernatants. The cell-free supernatants were collected for virus titration by focus-forming assays and the total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets (RNeasy mini kit - Qiagen) to quantify the ZIKV genomic RNA. The ZIKV infections of mdDCs were evaluated by flow cytometry using anti-human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as follows: anti-CD11c-PE-Cy5, CD14-BV450 and CD209-APC (BD Pharmingen, CA, USA) and their respective isotype controls. For intracellular ZIKV envelope protein detection, the mdDCs were permeabilised with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and were stained with 4G2-FITC at 1:200 (v/v) in Perm/Wash buffer. The cell suspensions were acquired in a FACSCanto II instrument (BD Biosciences) and were analysed by FlowJo software, version 10.0.7 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). The dendritic cells were first gated as CD11c
 <sup>+</sup>CD14
 <sup>-</sup> cells and then were gated as CD11c
 <sup>+</sup>CD209
 <sup>+</sup> cells; finally, 4G2
 <sup>+</sup> cells show the frequency of infected cells. The statistical analyses were performed using PRISM (version 7.0; GraphPad, San Diego, USA). The significance was determined using a paired, nonparametric test (Wilcoxon) among different stimulations in the same group. The values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.
