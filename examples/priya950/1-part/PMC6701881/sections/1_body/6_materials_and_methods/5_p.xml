<p>To perform an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> biological characterisation of the three ZIKV isolates, we first amplified the ZIKV ZV BR 2015/15098, ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR 2016/16288 isolates by three additional rounds of infection in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> C6/36 cells; a low multiplicity of infection (MOI of 0.01) was used to generate working virus stocks (passage 3 - P3). Virus titration was carried out on the same cell line by the focus-forming assay, adapted from a previously described protocol.
