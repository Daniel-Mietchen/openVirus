<p>A better understanding of the contribution of viral genetic markers to human disease and the viral spread in nature might be of paramount importance to design prophylactic or therapeutic strategies to control ZIKV infections. Here, we describe the isolation and present a comparative genetic and biological characterisation of three Brazilian ZIKV clinical isolates selected from two different epidemic periods. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the isolates reported in this manuscript belong to the Asian lineage. We identified nonsynonymous mutations in the genomes of these Brazilian ZIKV isolates and the biological characterisations of the viruses showed that the mammalian cell lines were more permissive to ZIKV infections than the insect cell lines.</p>
