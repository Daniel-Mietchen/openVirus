<p>The world of dengue is massive and its features are constantly changing, as evidenced by the expanding scientific literature. Studies on dengue as an arthropod-borne viral disease contribute to three areas of research: (a) one on mosquito vectors, their bionomics, virus–host interactions, epidemiology, and control; (b) a literature on the virus itself; and (c) another describing DENV–human interactions. This review is directed to the last of these, focusing on clinical features, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and vaccine development.</p>
