Investigators in Singapore and Malaysia conducted an open-label, randomized, superiority trial of platelet transfusion and enrolled 372 persons (21 years old or older) with acute laboratory-confirmed dengue with thrombocytopenia (not more than 20,000 platelets per microliter) but no severe or persistent mild bleeding. After enrollment, the subsequent frequency of clinical bleeding was slightly higher (26%) in the transfusion group, 13 of whom had adverse events, than in controls. No deaths were reported
