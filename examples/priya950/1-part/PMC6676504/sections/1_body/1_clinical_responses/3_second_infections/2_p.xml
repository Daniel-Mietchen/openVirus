<p>Despite a consensus on the importance of early recognition of the remediable dengue vascular permeability syndrome (DVPS) (fever, thrombocytopenia, abnormal hemostasis, elevated liver enzyme levels, hypoalbuminemia, complement activation, and vascular permeability), there is not wide agreement about how to define dengue disease

 </sup>. “Severe dengue” may include life-threatening conditions such as severe bleeding or impaired central nervous system, heart, or kidney functions in the absence of vascular permeability. This wide range of poorly defined and diverse pathophysiological endpoints may impede the early recognition and rapid and accurate assessment of fluid losses to be followed by accurate management of fluid resuscitation. Critically, research to identify pathophysiological mechanisms of the vascular permeability syndrome requires relevant and standardized case definitions
