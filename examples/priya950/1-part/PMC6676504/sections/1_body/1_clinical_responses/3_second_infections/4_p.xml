<p>A subset of severe dengue cases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), is increasingly recognized. HLH, a rare and potentially fatal disorder associated with acute infections, is characterized by fever, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and increased serum ferritin. In Puerto Rico, 22 dengue HLH cases, including one death, were detected from 2008 to 2013. Cases were often infants, who frequently had influenza co-infections and were satisfactorily treated with steroids
