 </sup>. DENV2 NS1 inoculated intravenously at physiologically relevant concentrations in sub-lethally DENV2-infected C57BL/6 mice resulted in lethal vascular permeability. Vaccination of mice with DENV2 NS1 protected them against endothelial leakage and death from lethal DENV2 challenge. Mice immunized with all four DENV NS1 proteins were completely protected against homologous DENV challenges, whereas immunization with DENV1 NS1 partially protected against heterologous DENV2 challenge. Furthermore, DENV NS1 was shown to directly alter the barrier function of pulmonary endothelial cell monolayers through disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer (EGL) by triggering the activation of endothelial sialidases, cathepsin L, and heparanase, enzymes responsible for degrading sialic acid and heparan sulfate proteoglycans
