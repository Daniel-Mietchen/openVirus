<p>The introduction of a new flavivirus, Zika, into the Western Hemisphere in 2015 was the cause of considerable consternation, not simply because of its unexpected linkage to Guillain–Barré syndrome; Zika infection of pregnant women also caused a congenital Zika syndrome in infants. There were additional fears that Zika infections might enhance DENV infections or vice versa. An entirely unsuspected outcome has been that Zika behaves like a highly effective dengue vaccine. The Zika epidemic of 2015 to 2016 was followed by a reduction in clinical dengue cases throughout Latin America from 2,413,693 in 2015 to about 500,000 in both 2017 and 2018, a 77% reduction in dengue cases (Pan American Health Organization data). Similar outcomes were reported from surveillance studies in Salvador, Brazil
