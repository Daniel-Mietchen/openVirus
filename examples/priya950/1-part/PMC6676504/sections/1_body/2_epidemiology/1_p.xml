<p>During yellow fever epidemics, it was well understood that multiple cases occurred among members of households but also in persons who visited infested homes. Though less obviously, this same epidemiological feature applies to dengue. Careful prospective studies in the city of Iquitos on the Amazon River in Peru successfully tracked household members throughout the city during DENV transmission seasons

Individuals increased their estimated transmission rate from 1.3 if they stayed at home to 3.75 when they visited other locations during daytime hours (for example, markets or homes of friends or relatives)
