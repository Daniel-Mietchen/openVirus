<p>In highly endemic southern Vietnam and Yogyakarta, a city in Indonesia, mobility data collected from children and young adults via prospective travel diaries found that all ages spent about half of their daytime hours (5 a.m. to 9 p.m.) at home while children under the age of 14 years spent a greater proportion of their time within 500 m of home than did older respondents. Mobility of specific age groups within populations must be taken into consideration in planning dengue preventive interventions
