<p>The reason why yellow fever continues to be a major health problem in the American tropics is a fateful event that occurred centuries ago: the stable introduction of yellow fever virus into a complex zoonotic cycle

A search for a sylvatic DENV cycle was initiated in a forested area of the eastern Amazon near Iquitos, Peru, a city where all four DENVs are endemic. Twenty seronegative Aotus monkeys were kept in jungle locations for a total of 10 years and were bled for virus and for antibody conversions with no evidence of DENV
