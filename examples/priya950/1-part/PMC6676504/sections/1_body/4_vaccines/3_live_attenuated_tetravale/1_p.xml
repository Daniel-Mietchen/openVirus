<p>There is good dengue vaccine news. For nearly 20 years, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health have designed and tested dengue vaccine candidates. Some were attenuated by removing nucleotides from the non-translated region of the dengue genome. A crucial component of this development program was testing monovalent vaccine candidates for immunogenicity and attenuation in seronegative human volunteers

 </sup>. A final product, the live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (LATV), consists of mutated DENV 1, 3 and 4 and a chimera of structural DENV 2 on a DENV 4 backbone

 </sup>. Following a single dose of LATV, volunteers were solidly protected from viremia, dengue symptoms, or anamnestic antibody responses after challenge with non-parental wild strains of live DENV2 (Tonga 74) or 3 (Sleman 78)

 </sup> (Dr. Anna Durbin, personal communication, April 4, 2019). That this protection is likely to be of long duration is evidenced by the solid immune response observed to a booster dose of live-attenuated vaccine given 12 months after initial dose

 </sup>. Protection results are complemented by evidence that a single dose of LATV raises monospecific neutralizing antibodies that are conformationally similar to antibodies raised after human infections with wild-type DENVs that correlate with protection

 </sup>. Moreover, the T-cell responses to LATV closely resemble those raised after infections with wild-type DENVs

 </sup>. Finally, LATV contains genes for three of the four DENV NS1 proteins. LATV is in the third year of phase 3 clinical testing in Brazil. The rate of accruing dengue vaccine efficacy data has been delayed because of an 80% reduction of DENV cases following the Zika virus epidemic of 2016–17 in Brazil

 </sup>. The outlook for LATV, based on phase 2 clinical trials in humans, is that a single dose of this vaccine will raise durable and solid protection against dengue infections in both seronegatives and seropositives.
