<p>Another explanation for Dengvaxia protection failure is that antibodies raised by vaccine may be poorly matched to the specific DENV genotypes in circulation. Two groups found genetic differences in the DENVs recovered during the first 25 months after first dose from placebos or vaccinated children

 </sup>. The DENV4 in the Sanofi vaccine is genotype II. Genotype I (GI) and genotype II (GII) DENVs were both circulating in Asia during the vaccine trial. Both groups found vaccine efficacy to be higher against GII (83%) compared with GI (47%) DENV4s. In fact, Juraska and colleagues demonstrated that variations at three positions on the envelope protein of DENV4 are strongly correlated with vaccine efficacy

 </sup>. These three amino acid positions map to a region on E protein recognized by strongly neutralizing antibodies in people who have been infected with DENV4

 </sup>. Indeed, another study recently demonstrated large differences in the ability of sera from na√Øve subjects who received the National Institutes of Health dengue vaccine (also based on a DENV4 GII envelope) to neutralize different genotypes of DENV4

 </sup>. When Dengvaxia data were stratified by age, the effect was stronger in younger than older children 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>
 </sup>. In children 2 to 8 years old, vaccine efficacy against GII viruses was 76.3% whereas efficacy against GI viruses was only 23.9%. In older children (9 to 14 years old), the vaccine was highly efficacious against both GII (89.8%) and GI (85.5%) viruses. The observation that older children who received the Sanofi vaccine were equally protected against DENV4 GI and GII viruses is best explained by the fact that most of these children had immunity to DENVs before vaccination. In this population, the vaccine stimulates strongly cross-neutralizing and cross-protective antibodies analogous to antibodies that develop after natural second DENV infections with a heterologous serotype

 </sup>. These antibodies, which target conserved epitopes between serotypes, are unlikely to be influenced by subtle differences between genotypes. In people with no pre-existing immunity to DENVs, current vaccination strategies rely on the ability to induce serotype-specific protection. However, Dengvaxia protection is not durable. Indeed, over the period of 5 to 6 years after first dose, children 2 to 8 years old, vaccinated when seronegative, were not protected but neither did they experience enhanced DENV4 disease

 </sup>. It is known that Dengvaxia raises DENV4 type-specific neutralizing antibodies in seronegative persons 
 <sup>

 </sup>. Perhaps, early after vaccination, DENV4 GI antibodies circulate at levels that protect against vaccine-matched GII but not the mismatched GI strains.
