<p>In January 2018, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company (Tokyo, Japan) announced the completion of phase 3 trials for TAK 003

 </sup>. Efficacy and safety data for this vaccine have not yet been published (

The vaccine consists of a live-attenuated DENV2 strain and three chimeric viruses containing the prM and E protein genes of DENV1, 3, and 4 expressed on the backbone of the DENV2 genome

 </sup>. The vaccine also includes structural DENV1, 3, and 4 proteins expressed on a DENV2 backbone. The developers hope for successful protection against all DENV infection/disease on the basis of the broad neutralizing antibody responses that follow two doses of TAK 003. Publication of clinical data from phase 3 clinical trials is awaited with interest.
