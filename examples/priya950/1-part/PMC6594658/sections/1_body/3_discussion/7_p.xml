<p>During the height of the ZIKV threat, public health agencies in the US rapidly implemented both preventative measures (e.g., vector control and educational campaigns) and response measures (e.g., laboratory testing and epidemic trigger plans), particularly in high-risk southern states. Decision makers sought to identify and narrow the spatiotemporal scope of outbreak risk to enable targeted responses, efficiently allocate resources, and avoid false alarms [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our method facilitates such rapid, real-time geographic risk estimation from typical early outbreak data, and allows for real-time updating of estimates as new data arise. In interpreting our results from 2016 in retrospect, they would suggest that the baseline transmission risk combined with the public health response was sufficient to mitigate the threat of a ZIKV epidemic across the state. Our method cannot disentangle the impact of public health response from the underlying transmission risk, so we cannot estimate the impact of the public health interventions. In real time, our results would have validated the magnitude of the public health response through the summer of 2016, and likely alleviated some of the epidemic concerns that arose in the winter when a handful of locally transmitted cases were detected in the state.
