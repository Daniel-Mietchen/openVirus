<p>We presented a simple and rational method for continuously updating transmission risk estimates for populations experiencing infectious disease importations, with or without secondary transmission. As we demonstrated for ZIKV in Texas, large numbers of terminal importations can profoundly lower both estimated risks of transmission and uncertainty in prior estimates, particularly those derived from ecological suitability or other models that borrow inputs from related pathogens in other parts of the world. Expanding our model to other regions could sharpen transmission risk estimates, and allow for more targeted public health interventions in the remaining hot spot locations [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Transmission risk estimates always include uncertainty, but by assimilating data in real-time, our method can help confirm or revise public health understanding in the midst of an outbreak. Although the threat of ZIKV emergence in the continental US motivated this study, this new framework can be applied to improve transmission risk assessments when a disease newly threatens a population via regular introductions with minimal secondary transmission.
