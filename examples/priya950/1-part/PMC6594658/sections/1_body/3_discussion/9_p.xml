 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Given that Florida experienced thousands of introductions, only a few of which sparked large outbreaks, coupling such outbreak-driven estimation with our terminal importation method may provide a powerful real-time risk assessment framework for exploiting all available data. This method resembles those used to assess disease transmission risk during elimination efforts, including malaria in non-endemic regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The key innovation is that, by starting with ecological suitability maps, we simultaneously identify important transmission hotspots and leverage case data from one region to inform risk estimates elsewhere.
