<p>The updating method itself also requires several simplifying assumptions. First, it relies on informative Bayesian priors for the relative spatiotemporal risk of a region. Posterior estimates could be biased by errors in these priors. At this point, we lack sufficient data from Texas to improve our estimates of the component parameters of

 <sub>0</sub>. The lack of such data, in fact, motivated our more modest goal of refining estimates of relative risk across counties. We could potentially improve model accuracy by incorporating smoothing techniques that more realistically capture spatiotemporal correlations and heterogeneity in transmission risk across Texas. This method also treats all importations as independent. However, spatiotemporal heterogeneity in case detection probabilities or clustering of cases (e.g., testing of travel companions) could bias risk estimates. When secondary clusters are detected, we assume they share a transmission tree stemming from a single detected importation. In this case, the low ZIKV detection rate suggests that both primary importations and secondary cases are likely to be missed. If the detection rates between the two types of cases are roughly similar our results hold. If importations are detected at higher rates than secondary cases, then the resulting risk estimates will be higher; when we assume the reverse, meaning locally transmitted cases are more likely to be detected than imported cases, the posterior risk estimates will be reduced. The additional assumption, that clusters are epidemiologically connected, seems reasonable for the small contained outbreaks detected in Texas, but may not be appropriate for importation-fueled arbovirus outbreaks in Florida, for example. In such cases, molecular data might enable estimation of transmission clusters [

Furthermore, there are identifiability issues associated with estimating the statewide scaling factor alongside the case detection probability, as both parameters modulate the expected number of secondary cases in the same fashion. We therefore used a strong, informative prior for the case detection probability from a previous study, and found no changes in the posterior distribution

If case detection is lower than we assumed, then the detected cases in Texas would have had to arise from larger outbreaks, so our final risk estimates would be closer to the prior (larger). Alternatively, if case detection in Texas is higher than we assumed, there would be an even larger discrepancy between our prior and resultant posterior risk estimates
