<p>Here, we introduce a method for performing real-time updating of ecologically informed estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> that reconciles discrepancies between initial estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and real-time data on local transmission of an emerging arbovirus. This approach is applicable to settings in which there is an ongoing threat of arbovirus importation and in which transmission has not precipitated a large-scale epidemic. In particular, this work was motivated by recent introductions of ZIKV into the continental US. As hundreds of cases arrived from affected regions throughout the Americas, officials sought to estimate risks of autochthonous (local) transmission and identify high-risk regions in the southern US. However, given the novelty of ZIKV and the large proportion of ZIKV cases that go undetected, early ecological estimates had high uncertainty [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our method combines indirect and direct estimation methods to reduce such uncertainty and increase accuracy at high spatiotemporal resolution. We first build prior ecological estimates of local 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and then harness real-time importation data—cases that arrive in a naive location with or without subsequently infecting others—to update the estimates, while explicitly modeling case reporting uncertainty. As a case study, we use the almost complete absence of secondary transmission following 298 importations of ZIKV into the state of Texas in 2016 and 2017 to lower and narrow local estimates of
