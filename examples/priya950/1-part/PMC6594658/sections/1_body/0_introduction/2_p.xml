<p>Epidemiological risk assessment—estimating the severity and transmissibility of a threatening disease—can be vital to successful mitigation with limited resources. Historical outbreak data can provide invaluable insight into future epidemic risk. However, for a pathogen that has yet to arrive or has just begun to spread, we are forced to borrow epidemiological data from other populations or related pathogens, or to indirectly assess risk based on environmental suitability. For example, as the first importations of ZIKV arrived in the US in 2016, early attempts to determine the likelihood and rate of local transmission relied primarily on dengue epidemiological data from regions with markedly different climatic and socioeconomic conditions [
