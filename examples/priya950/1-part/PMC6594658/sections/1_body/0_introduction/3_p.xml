<p>These ecological risk assessments provide information regarding the basic reproduction number of a disease (

 <sub>0</sub> encompasses the combined effects of the multi-step transmission life cycle: a mosquito biting an infected individual, incubating the disease and becoming infected, and finally biting and infecting a new susceptible individual. In a naive population,

 <sub>0</sub> indicates whether importations can potentially lead to sustained local epidemics; if so, it also provides insight into the probability, magnitude, and speed of spread [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, ecological estimates often carry considerable uncertainty stemming from model parameterization and regional extrapolation, and suggest a wide range of possible epidemic outcomes, from terminal importations to stuttering chains of transmission to full blown epidemics [
