<p>In a sensitivity analysis that assumes âˆ¼20 times more undetected importations, we found that the estimated risks decreased further (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). We also varied the number of detected autochthonous cases in November: as they decrease from one to zero, the estimated risks decrease considerably; as they increase to five, estimated risks increase, with 83 counties becoming at risk for a local outbreak (
