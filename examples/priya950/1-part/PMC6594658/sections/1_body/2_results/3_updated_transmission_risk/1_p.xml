<p>Based on all importations and autochthonous cases that occurred in Texas prior to January 2017, we estimate that all Texas counties have a median posterior

 <sub>0</sub> below 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007395.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Median estimates range from 0 to 0.29; upper-bound estimates range from 0 to 1.12, with only six (5%) of the original 119 high-risk counties maintaining epidemic potential (

The six counties with remaining epidemic risk are all contained within the greater Houston metropolitan area, and all have relatively low estimated transmission risk estimates ranging from 0.25-0.29 (Grimes, Houston, Madison, Montgomery, Walker, and Waller counties). When we assume historic averages rather than 2016 temperatures, we obtain similar results (
