<p>We use transmission risk estimates based on importations through December 2016 to estimate the number of autochthonous cases we would expect to detect in Texas in 2017. Based on our posterior estimates we estimate a 1% probability of at least one single detected case in Hidalgo county at the time the secondary transmission occurred. Since the sample size is low, we average the expected number of secondary cases over the 2017 time period where importation data were available. Assuming first that only the reported importations occurred in 2017 (26 total), we estimate that there should have been 0.08 (95%CI: 0-1) detected autochthonous cases in the state; assuming that many importations went undetected, according to the reporting probability (
