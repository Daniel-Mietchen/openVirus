<p>To derive 
 <italic>a priori</italic> distributions of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for each county-month, we drew 1,000 Monte Carlo samples from each parameter underlying the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> formulation described above. This accounted for uncertainty in 
 <italic>Î¼</italic>, 
 <italic>n</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> occurrence probability, and the relationship between PPP and 
 <italic>m</italic>, consistent with previous descriptions of uncertainty for each of those parameters [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These parameter draws were applied to the appropriate county and month data for Texas. Finally, we fit gamma distributions to each probability distribution for local transmission risk for use as informative priors, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s003">S2 Fig</xref> for comparisons between the samples and the fitted gamma distributions.
