<p>YFV was introduced into the Americas in the 16th century from Africa, probably as part of the slave trade in ships bringing sick viremic individuals, in addition to the vector 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. In the Brazilian Northeast, the virus produced large outbreaks in the 17th century, possibly transmitted by the same vector. At some moment between the 16th and 20th century, presumably as a consequence of more than one spill-over, YFV began to infect sylvatic primates and be transmitted by 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> mosquitoes from tree canopies (Franco,
