<p>YFV is the oldest Brazilian example of an urban arbovirus that became sylvatic in South America. Today, yellow fever has shown to be a zoonosis of non-human primates that moves as a wave throughout the Amazon, Central Plateau, and Pantanal of Brazil, traveling thousands of kilometers and killing many animals, eventually leading to the infection of man in contact with the wild environment (Monath and Vasconcelos, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, since 2016, the zoonotic wave has reached the highly populated areas of the Brazilian Southeast, generating the largest epidemic in the past 60 years. Epizootics of yellow fever in primates have advanced through gallery forests, mostly along rivers of Southeast Brazil, reaching large cities such as Belo Horizonte (2 million inhabitants) in 2016–2017, as well as Rio de Janeiro (8 million inhabitants) and São Paulo (12 million inhabitants), both in 2017–2018. From January 2016 to June 2017, transmitted in a sylvatic cycle, yellow fever caused 3,140 cases with 410 deaths, mostly in the States of Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro. In the second semester of 2017 and first semester of 2018, the epizootic moved southwestward, resulting in 1,266 cases and 415 deaths (Brazilian Ministry of Health,
