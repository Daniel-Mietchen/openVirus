<p>Several actions could be taken to anticipate that potential sylvatic cycles of DENV-1-4, CHIKV, and ZIKV re-originate urban transmission by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. One critical factor should be the maintenance of arbovirus surveillance in wild animals and vector mosquitoes. As for YFV, it would be essential to vaccinate more than 80% of the population against DENV 1-4, CHIKV, and ZIKV. However, since no vaccines are currently available for these viruses, their urgent development is required. It is also crucial to devise fast and reliable methods for the diagnosis of arbovirus infections in humans and animals. Arboviruses originated from wild cycles must be analyzed for mutations, changes regarding virulence or particular clinical patterns in infected patients. Ultimately, it is fundamental to develop antivirals and other drugs to treat patients. Recently, encouraging studies 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in laboratory animals have shown that Sofosbuvir, a drug used to treat Hepatitis C, is also effective against YFV, DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV (Bonotto et al.,
