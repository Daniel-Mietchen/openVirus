<p>This study has used a secondary source of information, from Colombiaâ€™s Public Health Surveillance System. With this surveillance system, there may be underreporting of disease cases and thus underestimation of the disease burden. Additionally, improper classification of a condition may be related to difficulties in obtaining laboratory confirmation of cases. Further research is necessary to understand the current trends in the co-circulation of arboviruses in the countries of Latin America.</p>
