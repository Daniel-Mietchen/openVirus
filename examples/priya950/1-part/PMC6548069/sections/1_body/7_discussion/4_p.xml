<p>Campos et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) reported an association of ZIKV infection in 42% of selected patients in northeastern Brazil. The same study also revealed CHIKV co-circulation in 12.5% of investigated cases. Several studies have suggested that the related arboviruses show a level of cross-protection. That is, prior exposure to a virus generates an acquired response after exposure to the second virus, which may decrease the likelihood of sequential infections. The evident reduction in dengue incidence after the co-circulation of the three viruses supports this hypothesis if it occurs in areas endemic for arboviruses. That is because in susceptible persons, no preexisting immune response can be expected for any of the arboviruses, and thus a low cross-response would occur (
