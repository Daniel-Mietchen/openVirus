<p>A descriptive data analysis involving the absolute and relative frequencies of variables and their proportions by department was performed. Additionally, the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the relative frequencies were determined. Quantitative variables, such as age, were described using median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. Incidence was calculated per 100Â 000 inhabitants, and frequencies and percentages were used to describe the main characteristics of the cases for variables such as age, sex, and department. The rates were also stratified by department.</p>
