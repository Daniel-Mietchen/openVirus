<p> Numerous previous studies reported that adenoviruses, influenza A and B, human rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses are the predominant viruses detected in the military population. Outbreaks of adenovirus-associated respiratory disease have been reported globally in the military environments (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It has been suggested that adenovirus infection is associated with male gender, as well as direct contact with an infected person with respiratory symptoms 10 days prior to the onset of illness (

 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It has been proposed that crowded living quarters, obesity, asthma, and age group (younger than 40 years) are amongst the major risk factors for acquiring influenza infections (
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Human rhinoviruses are the most important causative agents of the common cold and associated with more complicated upper respiratory tract infections (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Approximately, all the human rhinoviruses have been detected in military trainees during respiratory infection (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). It has been also well documented that human rhinoviruses are associated with lower respiratory tract infections (
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Nevertheless, there are other viruses associated with respiratory infections which are not well studied in military populations, including respiratory syncytial viruses (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), human bocaviruses (
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), human parainfluenza viruses (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), metapneumoviruses (
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and echoviruses (
