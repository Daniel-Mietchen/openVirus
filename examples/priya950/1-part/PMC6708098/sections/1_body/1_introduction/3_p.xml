<p> Until now, there is no study which aimed to investigate the prevalence of viral agents responsible for respiratory infections among the military population in Iran. Using micro-array technology, the objective of our study was to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of 17 viral pathogens causing respiratory infections among 400 military trainees in a large military training camp in Tehran, over a period of time from January to March 2017. The data resulted from this study can be employed to take preventive measures aimed to reduce the disease burden and prevent future outbreaks. </p>
