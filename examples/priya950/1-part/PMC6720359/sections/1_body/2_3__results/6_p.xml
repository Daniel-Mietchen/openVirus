<p>Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes of the 35 IBV strains characterised during the 2017-2018 influenza season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) showed that all of the B/Yamagata strains clustered into clade 3 (with reference strains B/Wisconsin/01/2010 and B/Phuket/3073/2013, of which the latter was the vaccine strain contained in the quadrivalent vaccine). Among the 35 IBV strains, 14 (40.0%) were identified in vaccinated patients. In particular, two patients, belonging to the 50–64-year age group, were vaccinated with the quadrivalent vaccine (QIV), two with the trivalent vaccine (TIV), and ten with the adjuvanted trivalent vaccine (aTIV). All the strains identified in Apulia had N116K, K298E, and E312K amino acid substitutions, relative to the B/Wisconsin/01/2010 reference strain. In addition, the strains identified in Apulia, in common with most of those identified in Italy, were characterised by L172Q and M251V amino acid substitutions, relative to both of the reference strains. Moreover, two strains characterised in Apulia had the D229N substitution, and one of these strains also had the Y165H, Y178H, and N397S substitutions. In addition to N116K, K298E, E312K, L172Q, and M251V, B/Bari/428/2018 had F95Y and A292T substitutions, and B/Bari/224/2018 had the N217D substitution. No amino acid substitutions within the four major epitope domains comprising the 120-loop (amino acids 116–137), 150-loop (amino acids 141–150), 160-loop (amino acids 162–167), and 190-helix (amino acids 194–202) [
