<p>In Apulia, as in the rest of Italy, the 2017-2018 influenza season had one of the greatest impacts on public health throughout the past 10 years [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In Apulia, the incidence of ILI was similar to that registered overall in Italy, but the peak was reached 1 week earlier [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. IAV and IBV cocirculated, with a high incidence of IBV in the first part of the season, causing extensive outbreaks in adults and notably in the elderly. After the peak was reached in Apulia, the incidence of IBV infection fell, and infection with A/H1N1pdm09 became predominant. The proportion of influenza infections resulting from IBV was higher in Apulia than in Italy as a whole (71.0% versus 60.0%) [
