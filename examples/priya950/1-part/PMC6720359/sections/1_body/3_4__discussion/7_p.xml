<p>The use of influenza vaccines in those &gt;64 years old is under debate in response to contrasting evidence. On the one hand, the use of QIV in those aged 65–74 years with no comorbidities has been shown to be associated with substantial health and financial benefits [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and a switch from aTIV to QIV has been predicted to be most cost-effective for individuals &gt;64 years old [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, administration of the QIV induces an immune response that is considered to be protective according to the European Medicines Agency criteria, even in the &gt;64-year age group [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. On the other hand, evidence has been presented that the use of QIV in the &gt;64-year age group would result in higher costs and lower health benefits than the use of aTIV [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. An Italian Health Technology Assessment has also indicated that the use of aTIV in the elderly seems to be the best choice [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. QIV may not result in a significant advantage in the elderly because aTIV can produce substantial cross-protection between the two linages of IBV, independent of the match between the circulating strain and the vaccine strain [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Further evidence of the relative effectiveness of the different influenza vaccines in the elderly is needed for definitive recommendations to be made.
