<p>A series of positive samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 73) was collected by convenience sampling from cases identified through InfluNet surveillance of individuals with ILI and from patients with SARI or ICU-ARDS, and was subjected to sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Sequencing in the HA gene was performed using conventional Sanger-sequencing methodology: 35 were IBV (four from individuals with ILI, 17 from patients with SARI, and 14 from ICU-ARDS), 36 were influenza A/H1N1pdm09 (five from individuals with ILIs, 10 from patients with SARI, and 21 from ICU-ARDS), and two were influenza A/H3N2 (one from a patient with SARI and one from ICU-ARDS). The SuperScript III One-Step PCR Amplification Kit (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy) was used for HA gene amplification according to the WHO protocol [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and PCR products were purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Milano, Italy). Sequences were assembled and analysed with CLC DNA Workbench 6.0 (Qiagen). Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (Mega) 7 software (https://www.megasoftware.net/) was used for sequence alignment by the ClustalW method, for comparison of sequences with those contained in the GenBank and Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) databases, and for generation of phylogenetic trees. Most of the sequences generated in this study were deposited in the GISAID database. Sequence accession numbers are reported in the phylogenetic trees. No depositing in GISAID was made for sequences nearly identical to that already deposited.
