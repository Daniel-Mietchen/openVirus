<p>The Apulia region has a population of &gt;4 million people. According to the national protocol, the regional influenza surveillance system surveys about 2% of the general population (80,000 inhabitants) and is based on a sentinel-physician network of paediatricians and GPs who report ILIs weekly [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Epidemiological and virological surveillance are managed by the Apulian Regional Observatory for Epidemiology. ILI is defined as a sudden onset of symptoms, with at least one of four systemic symptoms (fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, and myalgia) and at least one of three respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath) [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For epidemiological purposes, the number of reported ILIs from week 42/2017 to week 17/2018 was analysed. For virological purposes, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by sentinel physicians from nonhospitalised patients with ILIs from week 46/2017 to week 17/2018. Respiratory samples such as nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavages, and bronchial aspirates were also collected from throughout the region from hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), defined as fever and at least one sign or symptom of acute respiratory illness (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, and coryza) [
