<p>Research in understanding mosquito ecology, the most important way RVFV is spread amongst animals, is a prerequisite in prevention and control measures for RVF. In addition is monitoring to understand immunity in animals to protect against infection in these and humans from zoonotic exposure. By implementing collaborative cross-species RVFV surveys in livestock, wildlife, humans, and mosquito vectors together with climate and vegetation studies according to a one-health approach we had a much better chance to improve our understanding of RVFV ecology and epidemiology in South Africa instead of one-sided self-standing studies. Research by multidisciplinary team improved interdisciplinary communication and knowledge transfer which can lay foundation for continued collaboration at the control phase. At-risk community received awareness and education from professionals with a wide range of expertise in this way contributing to more effective joint disease control. Efforts are also shared in logistic services, the development and evaluation of diagnostic methods animal vaccines and larviciding measures, for example, that benefits early detection and prevention of loss of livestock and morbidity and death in humans in more cost-effective way. Associated risks identified in both animals and humans can be prevented and controlled in one way which should be more cost-effective. RVF forecasting and climatic models a frontline control method requires input from all disciplines to improve accuracy for local setting. </p>
