<p>The distribution of RVFV seropositivity was broad but patchy in the central plateau of South Africa. Focusing RVF control measures during epidemic and inter-epidemic periods toward zones at high risk for RVF at livestock-owning household- and neighborhood-level may result in a more cost-effective approach of RVF management and prevention of spread. Assessing the relationship between RVF clusters and environmental factors could further contribute to interventions for reducing transmission of RVFV. </p>
