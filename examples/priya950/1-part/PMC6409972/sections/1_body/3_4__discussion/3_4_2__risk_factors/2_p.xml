<p>Our results are similar to findings of a systematic review and meta-analysis on RVFV risk factors [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] using studies between 1989–2011, which identified slaughtering but also contact with aborted animal tissues, assisting with the birth, and skinning as being significantly associated with RVFV seropositivity. While fresh carcasses can be a source of infection with RVFV, the virus is quickly destroyed by cooking the meat [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The bulk of food-borne RVFV infections are probably from cross-contamination during meat preparation, which would implicate poor hygiene practices and/or meat contamination during processing of a carcass. The results of the aforementioned meta-analysis also confirmed drinking raw milk as associated with positive RVFV serology [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but neither we nor Archer et al. in 2008–2011 [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found such an association for South Africa.
