<p>The study identified a true RVFV seroprevalence of 9.1% in 685 people from primarily private livestock farms four years after the 2010–2011 RVF outbreak. Another study conducted also in the central plateau, but three years after the 1974–1975 RVF outbreak, reported a seroprevalence of 14.5% in a farming community (68 farms, 1162 participants) [

Although the 1978 survey included farms within our study site, it only sampled known outbreak farms and also included sites that were quite distant; this, along with the differing duration since outbreak, study design and population’s age distribution and serological tests may explain the discrepancy between the observed seroprevalences, making it difficult to determine whether there was indeed a true difference in the extent of human exposure between the two epidemics.
