<p>Serological surveys conducted in other parts of the country that are considered low risk for RVF outbreak due to the low reported case numbers [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] published variable findings. A value of 10% in rural people near the eastern coast in northern KwaZulu-Natal during 1955–1958 [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which is similar to our and McIntosh et al. estimates [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Surveys reported less than 1% seroprevalence in 333 Kruger National Park (KNP) personnel during 2013–2014 [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and 0% in 64 veterinary staff and livestock workers at government diptanks in Mpumalanga [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], while we reported 8.0% among 138 veterinary professionals. The low detection compared to our study area could be explained by low virus activity or be due to high endemicity in wildlife (as in the KNP) [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], or an absence of large populations of wildlife and livestock. It is also expected that park personnel have different types of RVFV associated exposure risks as they are working with wild animals. There may also be difference in the sampled age when comparing the one survey to other surveys of veterinary professionals.
