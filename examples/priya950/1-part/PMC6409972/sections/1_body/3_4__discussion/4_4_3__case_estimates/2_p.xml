<p>Despite the observation of clinical RVF in people since 1930 [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the first deaths were only reported in 1974–1975 in South Africa [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. During the 2010–2011 outbreaks, 25 deaths were confirmed in South Africa [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The frequency of reported RVF complications and deaths has apparently increased in successive outbreaks from multiple African countries [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This rise may partly be due to re-assortment to virulence of live attenuated virus when infected livestock are vaccinated with live RVFV vaccine during outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The increase may also partly reflect better recognition of RVF cases in people over time. We believe, however, that statistics for South Africa are reliable and all deaths were correctly attributed to RVF during past outbreaks. In contrast to uncomplicated cases, they would have required and likely had access to hospitalization in South Africa.
