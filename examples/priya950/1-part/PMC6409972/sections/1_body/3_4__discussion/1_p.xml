<p>Our seroprevalence study achieved RVFV estimates for two high-risk populations in a high-outbreak area in South Africa. Based on seroprevalence and farm population estimates we were able to provide a conservative estimate of the cumulative number of infections that had occurred in the area in order to compare it with the number of confirmed reported cases during past outbreaks in South Africa. We also obtained the first multivariable logistic regression model identifying risks for RVFV exposure in high-risk population of high-outbreak area. We were able to use it to substantiate what had been reported from outbreaks and Archer et Al. [
