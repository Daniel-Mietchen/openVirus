<p>The seroprevalence estimate was based on selected farms and the veterinary professional register within an outbreak-prone area, and is not representative of the country as a whole (particularly for rural households that do not own ruminant livestock). The study targeted at-risk occupational groups in a high-risk area for RVFV exposure in order to find sufficient seropositivity to power a risk factor analysis. Future research should also include other areas of South Africa, including those that are at low risk of outbreaks, to get a better understanding of how RVFV epidemiology varies geographically. </p>
