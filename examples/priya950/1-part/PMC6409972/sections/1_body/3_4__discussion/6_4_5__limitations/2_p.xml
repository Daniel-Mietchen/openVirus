<p>Our calculations were based on information provided by the participants and may have been affected by recall bias and false self-reporting, e.g., it is much easier for a person to recall whether he/she had contact with animals than a mosquito bite exposure. Despite the small number of people without direct animal contact or working with game, we were able to draw some conclusions about factors associated with RVFV seropositivity which should be interpreted with caution. We used a simple simulation method to estimate cumulative numbers of infections that had historically occurred in the area. People exposed to more outbreaks may be under-represented in our sample because they might have died, and this may result in our estimates being conservative. Comparison with other areas will be limited with results obtained. We were not able to satisfy assumptions underlying other methods to calculate more informative estimates e.g., force of infection rather than a total number because estimates would vary a lot because of epidemic and occupational nature of RVFV infection amongst other. In addition, reliable population data for the study area during previous outbreaks are unavailable. Non-random sampling within farms may have affected the spatial analysis, which is dependent on accuracy of the farm-level estimates of seropositivity. If seropositive individuals moved between farms this could also have biased the spatial analysis. Geographic data were not available to analyse geographic distances between hotspots and other areas of the study.</p>
