<p>Local spatial tools found that farm RVFV seroprevalence was spatially clustered in certain areas. Hot and cold spots of farm seroprevalence of human RVFV adjusted for age were found, indicating there is a broad varied risk of past exposure within this 40,000 km
 <sup>2</sup> area of study. Disparity in spatial-temporal patterns of RVF outbreaks was documented in Tanzania [
