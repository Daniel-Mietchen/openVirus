<p>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an important emerging, zoonotic, mosquito-borne disease that causes periodic outbreaks in ruminants and febrile illness in humans [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The disease is caused by an RNA virus which belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> within the 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> family, order of Bunyavirales [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Approximately 80–90% of individuals infected with RVF virus (RVFV) manifest symptoms of influenza-like illness [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with a reported overall case-fatality rate of 1–3%, but as high as 50% among patients with hemorrhagic fever, hepatitis, and renal failure [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Retinitis occurs in up to 2% of RVF cases [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During RVF outbreaks, infection in livestock leads to increased occupational risk for humans exposed to tissues and fluids of infected animals [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Individuals at increased risk of RVFV infection include farmers and farm workers, veterinary professionals and those employed in the animal processing industry [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Humans in these professions often serve as sentinels of RVFV outbreaks even though the disease usually occurs first in animals and then in humans [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Inhalation of aerosols during slaughter of infected animals or inoculation via needle-stick or injury or broken skin are other routes of transmission in aforementioned occupational groups [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Laboratory-acquired RVFV infections have also been reported [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. General population may become susceptible to RVFV infection by consuming raw milk or via mosquito bites, but no human-to human transmission [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] has been documented.
