<p>Human sera were screened for IgG antibodies using an indirect ELISA based on a recombinant nucleocapsid antigen of RVFV using a cut-off value of 28.9 percentage positivity relative to a positive control (sensitivity, 
 <italic>Se</italic> = 99.72%; specificity, 
 <italic>Sp</italic> = 99.62%), as previously described [

 <italic>Se</italic> = 99.47%;
