<p>For the selection of farms, since no complete list of farms was available, we generated random geographic coordinates within the study area using ArcGIS 10.2 (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA) and projected them on Google Earth (Google LLC, Mountain View, CA, USA). The coordinates were selected with probability proportional to the density of livestock-owning households calculated using the 2011 National Census data [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The closest farm to each random coordinate was invited to participate to the study. If the farm owner refused participation, we invited the next closest farm willing to participate. All consenting target individuals in the selected farms were invited to participate. For the AHCW group we obtained a complete sampling frame of veterinary professionals working within the study area from the South African Veterinary Council register.
