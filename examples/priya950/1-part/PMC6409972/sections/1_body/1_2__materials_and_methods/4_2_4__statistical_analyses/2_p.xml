<p>We used logistic regression to assess the association between potential risk factors and the apparent RVFV serological status of study participants. For the multivariable logistic regression model, we included all variables with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.2 on univariable analysis and then dropped non-significant factors (
 <italic>p</italic> â‰¥ 0.05) with manual backward elimination. Some variables (e.g., job description on farm and the ownership of the land used by the farmer (private or communal)) were included in the model regardless of their significance in order to control for confounding. Analysis was done using Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) with adjustment for data that were collected using a survey sampling design and clustering using the svy-set command that specified the farm identifier as the primary sampling unit (cluster) variable and svy-prefix for estimation and risk factor analysis commands.
