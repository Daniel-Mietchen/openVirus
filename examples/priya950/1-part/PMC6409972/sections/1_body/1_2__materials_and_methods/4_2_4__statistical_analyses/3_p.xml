<p>The historical cumulative number of RVF cases that occurred in the study area was estimated as the product of the true seroprevalence, the number of livestock-owning households (LOHH) in the study area, and the number of employees per LOHH in the study area (2015–2016). A probability distribution of RVF case numbers with median and 95% credible interval (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of distribution) was obtained via 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations using @Risk (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, USA). Each simulation sampled from the following probability distributions for the input factors:
 <disp-formula>
  <italic>Seroprevalence ~ Beta(α, β)</italic>
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>
  <italic>No. of LOHH ~ Pert(a, b, c)</italic>
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>
  <italic>No. of employees per LOHH ~ Normal(μ, σ)</italic>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>α</italic> = total number of RVFV-seropositive farm workers, 
 <italic>β</italic> = total number of people sampled – α, 
 <italic>a</italic> = minimum no. of LOHH, 
 <italic>b</italic> = most likely no. of LOHH, 
 <italic>c</italic> = maximum no. of LOHH estimates,

 </inline-formula>. LOHH estimates were made using data available from the 2011 National Census ((K. Parry Statistics South Africa 2014, pers. Comm.) as described below. Data were based on 1541 “small areas,” a census-defined geographic area, within the study area. The numbers of LOHH per small area were obtained separately for cattle, for sheep and for goats and it was not possible to determine the total number of households that owned cattle or sheep or goats. The high LOHH estimate (
 <italic>c</italic>) assumed that no farms kept more than one species, the low LOHH estimate (
 <italic>a</italic>) assumed that every household kept all three species and the most likely LOHH estimate (
 <italic>b</italic>) assumed most likely in-between scenario calculated as average of 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic>.
