<p>We estimated proportion of seroprevalence and constructed confidence intervals adjusted for clustering at farm level by using the linearized variance estimator based on a first-order Taylor series linear approximation [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00140" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, we adjusted the apparent seroprevalence by test sensitivity and specificity as follows: 
 <italic>TP = (AP + Sp − 1)/(Se + Sp − 1)</italic> where 
 <italic>TP</italic> = true prevalence, 
 <italic>AP</italic> = apparent prevalence, 
 <italic>Sp</italic> = specificity, and 
 <italic>Se</italic> = sensitivity. We used the sensitivity and specificity of the two tests in series assuming conditional independence: 
 <italic>Se = Se1 × Se2</italic> and 
 <italic>Sp = 1 − (1 − Sp1) × (1 − Sp2)</italic> [
