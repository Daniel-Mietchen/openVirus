<p>The geographical coordinates of the farms where participants that had worked/lived at that farm for four years or longer (therefore were there during the 2010–2011 outbreaks) were sampled-were used for mapping the spatial distribution of the proportion of people that were seropositive on each farm and these data were used for hotspot analysis using ArcGIS 10.5. (Esri, Redlands, California, USA). We first checked overall pattern of the farm seroprevalence data by measuring spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s 
 <italic>I</italic> statistic), which was transformed to a 
 <italic>z</italic>-score, a measure of standard deviation from the mean from a normal distribution in which values greater than 1.96 or smaller than −1.96 indicate spatial autocorrelation that is significant at the 5% level [

 <italic>I</italic> tool. Next, we calculated the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic (
 <italic>z</italic>-score) by comparing the local situation, i.e., sum of the value for a farm in question and those of neighboring farms to the global situation, i.e., sum of all farm values [
