<p>Almost 25% (44/189) of the mapped farms had at least one seropositive individual. Amongst those, percentage of seropositive individuals ranged from 15–100% on a given farm. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00140-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the distribution of farms with respective seroprevalence of human RVFV and sample size. The spatial patterns of farm seroprevalence of human RVFV appeared not significantly different than random by global Moran’s 
 <italic>I</italic> statistic (
 <italic>z</italic> = −0.412, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.681). Instead Getis-Ord Gi* analysis was carried out as the spatial pattern was not consistent across the study area. Hot and cold spots of farm-level RVFV seropositivity locally within the study area were identified based on results of the Getis-Ord Gi* model of difference of observed and predicted seroprevalences, which indicated locations with causes for hot spots other than age (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00140-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Three hot spots of human RVFV seropositivity were identified: A hotspot of high intensity was located towards western central part of the study area which is the northwestern part of the Xhariep District, encompassing Jacobsdal and Koffiefontein (Getis-Ord Gi*
