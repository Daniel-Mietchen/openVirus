<p>On multivariable analysis (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00140-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), adjusting for intra-farm clustering, factors associated with increased risk of RVFV seropositivity were: slaughtering animals (odds ratio (OR) = 3.9; CI95%: 1.2–12.9); preparing/consuming meat of hooved animals found dead (OR = 3.1; CI95%: 1.5–6.6); working on farm with one or more man-made dam structures for holding water (OR = 2.7; CI95%: 1.0–6.9); and injection of and collection of samples from animals (OR = 2.3; CI95%: 1.0–5.3). There was also a distinct difference in prevalence of RVFV antibody between age groups and those that had experienced one versus two or more large epidemics: the seropositivity of 30–39 age group (6.1%; CI95%: 3.1–11.7%) versus 16–29 age group (2.6%; CI95%: 1.1–6.1%), that had both experienced only one large epidemic, was not significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.126); however, aged 40–49 (11.4%; CI95%: 6.3–20.9%) (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and aged 50–63 (18.9%; CI95%: 12.5–27.4%) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) that had both experienced two epidemics and 64 years of age and older (17.5%; CI95%: 8.4–32.9%) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) that had experienced three epidemics were all more likely to be seropositive than the youngest age group (aged 16–29). There was no significant difference between age group that experienced three versus two epidemics (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.539). The youngest seropositive individual was a 23-year-old farm worker.
