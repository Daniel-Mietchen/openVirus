A lower odds of seropositivity was found in people that assisted with surgery on farm animals (OR = 0.38; CI95%: 0.15–0.98). There was no association between the presence of seropositive animals (including both vaccinated and naturally exposed animals) and the serostatus of the humans associated with that farm (univariable
