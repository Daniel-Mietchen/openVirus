<p>Amongst veterinary professionals (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00140-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), similar to the LSFPs, the proportion of positive samples increased markedly in subjects older than 50 years: those aged 50–63 (OR = 92.5; CI95%: 7.2–1196) and those 64 or older (OR = 167; CI95%: 7.1–3916) were much more likely to have antibodies against RVFV than subjects younger than 50 years of age. No other factors for risk of RVFV exposure were retained as significant during multivariable analysis.
