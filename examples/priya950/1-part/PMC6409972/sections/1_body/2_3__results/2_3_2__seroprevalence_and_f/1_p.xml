<p>The RVFV apparent seroprevalence was 9.1% (62/685) among LSFPs and 8.0% (11/138) among AHCWs (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.87). Adjusting for test sensitivity and specificity and for clustering, the estimated true seroprevalence was 9.1% (CI95%: 7.2–11.5%) and 8.0% (CI95%: 4.5–13.8%) among LSFPs and AHCWs, respectively.
