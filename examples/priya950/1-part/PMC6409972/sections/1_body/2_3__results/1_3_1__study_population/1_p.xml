<p>A total of 823 individuals were enrolled and tested during October 2015–February 2016. The median age of participants with available data was 36 years (range 16–84 years). There was a much higher number male (93% (634/684)) than female (7% (50/684)) LSFPs encountered and sampled on farms and amongst AHCWs sex was more equally distributed between men (49% (68/138) and women (51% (70/138)). Most, 685 (83%) were LSFPs from 204 farms and 138 were AHCWs. Of the LSFPs 669 (98%) were from 199 domestic animal farms and the remaining 16 were from five farms that primarily farmed game. The majority, 641 (94%) participants were from 185 privately-owned farms and 44 participants were from 19 communal land farms. The median size of privately-owned farms was 1001–2000 ha. Six percent of farm owners refused participation, but these were replaced by a next farm willing to participate for the same geographical random point. A median of 3 (range 1–14) individuals were enrolled from the farms with a median of 4 LSFPs (range 1–45). Amongst the LSFPs with available data (684), 487 (71%) were farm workers or herdsmen (including several contracted wool shearers), 173 (25%) were farm/livestock owners or managers, and 24 (4%) were family members, housewives, domestic helpers or drivers. Amongst the AHCWs with available data (122), 66 (54%) were veterinarians, 37 (30%) were veterinary technicians, animal health technicians or para-veterinarians, 9 (7%) were veterinary nurses, 5 (4%) were researchers, 3 (3%) worked in game/nature conservation, and 2 (2%) indicated they practiced farming (
