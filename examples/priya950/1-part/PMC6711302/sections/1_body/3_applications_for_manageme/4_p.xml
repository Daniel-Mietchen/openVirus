<p>Following these approaches to surveillance, interventions can accordingly focus upstream or downstream in the pathway to spillover, given available data and resources, to limit cross-species transmission. At the wildlife–livestock interface, managing pathogen spillover is a main goal for animal husbandry, conservation and food security [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Yet, managers are often forced to make control decisions on the basis of limited evidence about intervention efficacy. Manlove 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] develop a spatially explicit, stochastic model of pathogen transmission within and between wildlife reservoirs and livestock recipient hosts to improve evidence-based decision-making. By varying host movement patterns and epidemic growth rates, the authors show that biosecurity, containment and retroactive vaccination of the reservoir are the most effective for limiting the spatial spread and magnitude of spillover risk for fast-moving epidemics in mobile hosts. By contrast, prophylactic vaccination and depopulation of the reservoir host were more successful for fast-moving epidemics with low rates of host movement. This framework provides general intuition for how to manage different pathogens at the wildlife–livestock interface, and a flexible platform for more rigorously investigating disease control strategies.
