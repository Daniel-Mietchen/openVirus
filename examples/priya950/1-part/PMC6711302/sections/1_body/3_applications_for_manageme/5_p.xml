<p>Ultimately, one of the primary goals of research focused on pathogen spillover is to design interventions that can reduce or eliminate disease burden in recipient hosts. Sokolow 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] explore how ecological interventions, which target the ecological context in which cross-species transmission occurs, can complement more traditional biomedical and veterinary interventions (e.g. vaccination, culling). The authors provide case studies to illustrate the potential for ecological interventions that target the reservoir host (sometimes indirectly, such as through the restoration of natural enemy populations [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]), pathogen survival in the environment, contact between reservoir and recipient hosts, or other aspects of risk in the recipient species. The authors also present a simple mechanistic model, parameterized for two example systems, that shows how nonlinear effects can produce counterintuitive results when comparing potential intervention strategies and highlights the importance of a detailed understanding of underlying ecological dynamics when designing and assessing interventions. Lastly, the authors draw attention to the importance of social, economic and political considerations to intervention success, as these can derail even the most efficient or cost-effective intervention. In particular, aligning the benefits of an intervention with the costs incurred is crucial to motivate ecological interventions and may require working across sectors for successful implementation.
