<p>The theme issue's second section uses empirical research, theory and synthetic reviews to understand the processes operating at each stage of pathogen spillover, from infection dynamics within the reservoir hosts to susceptibility and establishment of infection in the recipient host. For the former, the distribution and intensity of infection in reservoir hosts over space and time is the first determinant of spillover risk [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Data on these spatio-temporal dynamics help elucidate how pathogens circulate in reservoir hosts and when and where to expect pathogen excretion to be greatest [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, such field data can be expensive and difficult to collect, and researchers inevitably must tradeoff between the extent and intensity of spatial versus temporal sampling. Sampling is thus often opportunistic and fails to adequately describe spillover. Plowright 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] review factors that influence spatial and temporal variation in infection in reservoirs and describe sampling designs that can increase the quality and quantity of this information. Although the standard prescription from sampling theory is to sample randomly in space and time [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], probabilistic sampling designs are rare in the study of wildlife disease, given logistical challenges and non-random distributions of hosts. The authors highlight how stratified random sampling designs or adaptive sampling designs can help capture spatio-temporal pulses of infection when researchers have little 
 <italic>a priori</italic> data on concentrations of infection or spillover events in space and time. These sampling designs can be integrated into modelling approaches and used to better quantify pathogen shedding from reservoirs. Accordingly, Glennon 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] present a case study for how to use mechanistic models to differentiate among transmission processes for henipaviruses in straw-coloured fruit bats (
 <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic>). Using this virulent zoonosis as a case study, the authors generalize standard frameworks common in epidemiological modelling [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Given that henipavirus infection dynamics in bats are poorly understood, the authors study all possible transitions among infection states in bats to produce 46 potential models. Using likelihood-based methods, they fit these models to longitudinal data from captive bats to show strong support for reinfection after virus clearance and cycles of recurrent latent infection: key areas for future empirical work. This inclusive approach to confronting epidemiological models with longitudinal data in poorly understood reservoir host systems holds promise for elucidating spatio-temporal risk of pathogen spillover.
