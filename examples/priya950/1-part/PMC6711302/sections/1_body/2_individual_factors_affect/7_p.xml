They present three well-documented examples of viruses that have crossed these barriers to cause epidemics or pandemics in the new host species: influenza A viruses [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and canine parvovirus [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The authors emphasize the role of integrated models that consider all the steps required to go from exposure to spillover to epidemic or pandemic. Guth 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] expand upon these ideas through a comparative study of host and viral traits that predict virulence and the capacity for onward transmission in recipient hosts (i.e. humans). By expanding a previous global dataset of viral zoonoses [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], the authors show that increasing reservoir host phylogenetic distance from humans positively correlates with human mortality but negatively correlates with human-to-human transmissibility, suggesting that the virulence induced by reservoirs at high phylogenetic distance may limit viral capacity for onward transmission [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In particular, distantly related reservoirs, such as bats, harbour highly virulent zoonotic viruses with a lower capacity for onward transmission in recipient human hosts, building upon prior work describing bats as special reservoirs [
