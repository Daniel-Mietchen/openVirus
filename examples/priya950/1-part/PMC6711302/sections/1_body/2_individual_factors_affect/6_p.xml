<p>Once a pathogen has crossed these within-host barriers to replicate and disseminate in the recipient host, the outcome of infection may range from subclinical illness to death and from dead-end spillover to sustained onward transmission [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] focus on the conditions favouring pathogen emergence, from the initial jump into the recipient host to adaption in the novel host environment [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The authors highlight that our current understanding of host shifts stems primarily from viral infections, limiting generalizations to other pathogen taxa, given substantial differences in ecology and life history [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. They propose several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain why novel bacterial pathogens may be less likely to specialize on their novel hosts and then test these with a mathematical model. The authors demonstrate that high levels of phenotypic plasticity, low rates of evolution and the ability to recombine should reduce propensity to specialize, suggesting that novel bacterial infections may be more likely to result in transient spillovers or increased host ranges than in host shifts.
