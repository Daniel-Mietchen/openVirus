<p>Pathogen spillover is the process by which a pathogen is transmitted from a reservoir host species to a recipient host species [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The term is sometimes used more broadly, particularly in public discourse, blending in elements of onward transmission in the novel host species or even pathogen adaptation to the novel host [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This theme issue focuses on pathogen spillover 
 <italic>sensu stricto</italic>, except where explicitly noted. Many of the examples considered pertain to zoonotic spillover (i.e. from wildlife or domestic animals to humans), given recent epidemics (e.g. Ebola virus [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]) and pandemics (e.g. H1N1 influenza virus [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]); however, we emphasize the general methods and mechanisms involved in understanding spillover between any two species, such as those that threaten wildlife conservation (e.g. 
 <italic>Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae</italic> from domestic sheep to bighorn sheep [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) and the agricultural sector (e.g. 
 <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> from elk to cattle [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]).
