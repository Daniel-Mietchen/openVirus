<p>Spillover requires the spatial and temporal alignment of several hierarchical factors that must occur for a pathogen to be transmitted from a reservoir or source host to a recipient host of a different species [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These factors include reservoir host distribution and abundance, pathogen prevalence and shedding from reservoir hosts; pathogen survival in the environment or arthropod vector; recipient host contact with the infectious agent, reservoir host or arthropod vector; and susceptibility of the recipient host. Following spillover, another suite of factors determines whether a pathogen is transmitted within the recipient host population (e.g. [

For example, the distribution of reservoir hosts is often studied through ecology, contact between reservoirs and humans is often studied via epidemiology or anthropology, and the pathogenesis of zoonoses in humans is often studied with medical microbiology and immunology. While each factor must be studied and quantified, spillover is the emergent property of these collective processes. Studying each factor in isolation fails to account for the hierarchical and often nonlinear dynamics of the spillover system [
