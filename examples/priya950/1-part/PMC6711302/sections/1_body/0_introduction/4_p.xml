<p>This theme issue stemmed from a 2018 workshop on cross-species transmission of pathogens, where participants from interlinked fields including ecology, mathematical modelling, epidemiology, virology and immunology discussed how to better understand and predict pathogen spillover. Here, we bring together a diverse set of perspectives—including empirical research, theory and synthetic reviews—to highlight cutting-edge research and to provide a roadmap for quantifying and integrating host–pathogen dynamics at each step in the spillover process. Manuscripts are organized around three approaches. The first set of manuscripts focuses on integrating data streams to understand spillover dynamics and predict risk. The second set of manuscripts focuses on in-depth analysis of each of the factors affecting cross-species transmission: infection dynamics in reservoir hosts, pathogen survival in the environment, recipient host exposure, dose–response relationships and establishment of infection in recipient hosts. The final set of manuscripts focuses on applied perspectives, with an emphasis on surveillance and interventions. Here, we summarize these contributions to highlight key insights, methodologies and future directions to improve our understanding of pathogen spillover.</p>
