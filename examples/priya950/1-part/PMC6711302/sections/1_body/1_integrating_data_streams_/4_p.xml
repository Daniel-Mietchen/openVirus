The authors highlight that any such statistical efforts will compile a dataset of explanatory variables expected to relate to pre-spillover processes (e.g., infection prevalence in reservoirs, human vaccination coverage) that are aligned with one of two response variables: the presence and absence of spillover or the number of spillover events at some spatial and temporal resolution (e.g., spatio-temporal counts of yellow fever spillovers [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], reveals first principles for how such datasets will behave and how common statistical tools can produce misleading inferences and poor predictions. For example, percolation theory reveals an inherent nonlinearity in modelling spillover counts, in which statistical inferences are driven by the dominant reservoir sources of infection and the most limiting barriers to cross-species transmission; this nonlinearity can mask the influence of alternative reservoir species or barriers, both of which could be modified through interventions but whose sensitivity as a management tool will appear reduced under linear models. Percolation models provide a conceptual framework to connect statistical and mechanistic models with applications to limit risk by illuminating unexpected statistical principles governing pathogen spillover and the nonlinear impacts of management actions.
