 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The authors focus their case study on yellow fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease of historical importance in South America that persists in the region largely in sylvatic cycles that occasionally spill over to infect humans [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Specifically, they use mechanistic models that incorporate spatial ecological and immunological data from Brazil across 16 years to predict yellow fever spillover in humans. The authors show that a mechanistic model of spillover risk, based on the ecology of mosquito vectors and non-human primate reservoirs, best predicts spillover events compared with models that also include human population size and immunity. This result arises because spillover occurs even in areas with low human population density and high vaccination coverage (e.g. parts of the Amazon), so population density and vaccination coverage tend to inflate the predicted risk in locations with low ecological suitability. This integrated approach also highlights a key research gap—cyclical dynamics of susceptible primate populations—that could further improve prediction. This work illustrates that mechanistically modelling the interactions among the environment, viruses, vectors, non-human primates and humans can predict rare and seemingly stochastic spillover events with high accuracy.
