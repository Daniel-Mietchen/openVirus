 <xref rid="RSTB20190014C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] review approaches for estimating spatio-temporal variation in spillover risk, focusing on the wildlifeâ€“livestock interface. The authors highlight the challenges inherent in either correlating observed spillover events with relevant covariates or integrating data on host density, distribution and pathogen prevalence using mechanistic models. They highlight that mechanistic approaches may be especially useful in systems where spillovers are infrequent, rarely observed or hard to differentiate from within-species transmission; however, linking datasets on different factors in the spillover pathway requires that such datasets be related to a common spatial and temporal resolution. The authors use case studies of brucellosis in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem [
