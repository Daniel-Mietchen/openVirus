<p>To date, more than 300 wild and domestic avian species have been described as susceptible to WNV infection (
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Komar et al., 2003</xref>), being corvids highly prone to it and important virus amplifiers (
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Komar et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez de Oya et al., 2018</xref>) thus playing a key role in the epidemiology of the virus (

 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Eidson et al., 2001a</xref>,

 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Reisen et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Hinton et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, WNV epidemics in the US were associated with high crow mortality and have even led to a significant decrease of native crow species (

 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">LaDeau et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Ernest et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Foss et al., 2015</xref>). Corvids seem to be also involved in the WNV endemic cycle in human habitats in Europe (
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Calistri et al., 2010</xref>). Among them, the magpie is one of the most abundant corvids in Europe (
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Madge, 2018</xref>). Magpies live in urbanized landscapes and constitute a feeding preference of 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>, a main WNV-vector to humans (
 <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Rizzoli et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, it has been reported to be highly susceptible to viral infection and a possible source of WNV transmission (
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez de Oya et al., 2018</xref>), making of this bird species an interesting player in WNV ecoepidemiology. Similar to American Yellow-billed magpies (
 <italic>Pica nutalli</italic>) and American crows (
 <italic>Corvus brachyrhynchos</italic>), Eurasian magpies form large communal roosts outside the breeding season that could be important for WNV persistence during winter by bird-to-bird transmission, as has been suggested for American crows (
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Hinton et al., 2015</xref>).
