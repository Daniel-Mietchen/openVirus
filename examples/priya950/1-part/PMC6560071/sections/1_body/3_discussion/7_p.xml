<p>By day 14 after immunization, NAbs were detected in 50% of the animals (5/10, mean PRNT
 <sub>90</sub> = 70.6 ± 92.9) upon a single dose of the vaccine. By day seven after viral infection, and with the exception of one vehicle-inoculated magpie, NAbs titres were detected in all challenged birds, but titres were higher in non-vaccinated animals than in vaccinated ones (mean PRNT
 <sub>90</sub> = 3,027 ± 1,949 vs. PRNT
 <sub>90</sub> = 2,555 ± 1,539, respectively), probably due to a more prominent and generalized viral replication that enhances the humoral immune response (

 <sub>90</sub> = 5,103 ± 2,827 vs. PRNT
 <sub>90</sub> = 1,214 ± 1,387, respectively). These results point out that, besides the contribution of the NAbs, the cellular immune response is likely to play a pivotal role in containing infection, an aspect that merits further investigation.
