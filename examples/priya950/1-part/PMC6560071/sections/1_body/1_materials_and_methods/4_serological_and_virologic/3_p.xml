<p>Detection of WNV NAbs in sera was performed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using twofold dilutions of previously filtered, heat inactivated (30 min at 56°C) sera (
 <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez-Calvo et al., 2017</xref>). Antibody titres were established by calculating the inverse of the highest dilution (minimum dilution 1:20) capable of inhibiting virus replication by 90% (PRNT
 <sub>90</sub>).
