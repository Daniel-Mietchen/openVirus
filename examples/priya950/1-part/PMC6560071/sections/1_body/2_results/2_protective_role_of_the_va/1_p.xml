<p>Both vehicle-inoculated (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9) and vaccinated (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) groups were challenged with 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> pfu/magpie of the neurovirulent WNV-NY99 strain 29 days post-immunization (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Magpies that succumbed to the infection showed disease-related signs (less than 12 h prior to death) such as ruffled feathers, lethargy, loss of equilibrium, and ataxia, as did sick animals before being euthanized according to endpoint criteria. Weight loss was observed in both infected groups of birds at days 7 and 10 p.i., although in vaccinated birds, it was significantly less pronounced and delayed in comparison to unvaccinated magpies (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). From there on, surviving animals began to gain weight until the end of the experiment. Survival rate in vehicle-inoculated birds (22.2%, 2/9) was significantly lower than in vaccinated magpies (71.4%, 5/7) (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). One vaccinated bird was sacrificed at 7 d.p.i. for the purpose of histopathologic analysis and, thus, it was excluded from the survival analysis. Mortality kinetics in vaccinated magpies (dead at day 10 p.i.) was delayed as compared to that of non-immunized birds, which died between days 6–10 p.i. (median survival time, MST, 6 d.p.i.).
