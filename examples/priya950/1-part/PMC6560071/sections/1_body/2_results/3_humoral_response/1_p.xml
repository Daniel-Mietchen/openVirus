<p>None of the birds presented anti-WNV NAbs, measured as PRNT
 <sub>90</sub>, nor WNV genome prior to immunization. The RSP-based vaccine elicited detectable WNV NAbs in five vaccinated birds at day 14 after immunization (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). WNV challenge induced humoral immunity in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups, although with different kinetics and magnitude, peaking at 7 and 10 d.p.i. in vehicle-inoculated and RSPs-vaccinated magpies, respectively, with significantly higher antibody titres in vaccinated than in vehicle-inoculated magpies at 10 d.p.i.
