<p>Contact animals that were not challenged were housed with WNV-challenged birds in both groups (four in the RSPs-vaccinated and six in the vehicle-inoculated group) throughout the experiment to explore bird-to-bird virus transmission. In the vaccinated group, two of the contact magpies had been vaccinated and two were not (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Bird-to-bird contact was analyzed based on presence of NAbs and infectious virus in sera and feather follicles. Remarkably, viral transmission was observed in contact birds housed with vehicle-inoculated birds, but not in those allocated with immunized cage-mates (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), which indicates the capability of the vaccine to confer herd immunity. Bird-to-bird viral transmission was confirmed by detection of viremia in 3/6 (50%) contact magpies housed with vehicle-inoculated cage-mates at 7 d.p.i. (

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Contact-infected magpies presented NAbs from day 10 p.i., again with some delay in comparison to the experimentally challenged birds (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Infectious virus was also found in the feather follicles of contact-infected birds from 7 to 19 d.p.i., depending on the animal (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), but also with a delay in comparison to their challenged cage-mates. These results support that the control of the virus after WNV-RSPs vaccination averts bird-to-bird infection, as none of the contact magpies included in the vaccinated group was infected.
