  <p>ZIKV-IG treatment decreases viral burden in key non-neuronal target organs of ZIKV in mice. Groups of 
   <italic>Ifnar1</italic>
   <sup>−/−</sup> mice (n = 6) were infected with 1.0 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of ZIKV strain FSS13025 (via r.o. route). At 24 hrs p.i., mice were treated (r.o. route) with either vehicle (circles) or 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG (squares). Viral RNA and infectious viral particle levels were determined by qRT-PCR and FFA, respectively, at days 3 and 7 p.i. in the (
   <bold>A</bold>) serum and (
   <bold>B</bold>) kidney, spleen and liver. Dotted lines indicate the limit of detection. The p values were obtained using non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests followed by the Bonferroni correction. Study groups were compared for statistical significance for each tissue and time-point. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.
