  <p>ZIKV-IG treatment decreases ZIKV NS2B expression in the liver and brain of ZIKV-infected mice. Groups of 
   <italic>Ifnar1</italic>
   <sup>−/−</sup> mice (n = 8) were infected with 1.0 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of ZIKV strain FSS13025 (via r.o. route). At 24 hrs p.i., mice were treated (r.o. route) with vehicle or 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG. At day 7 p.i., tissues were harvested to detect ZIKV NS2B expression via IHC. (
   <bold>A</bold>) NS2B expression in the liver (rust color dots, representative examples marked by arrows) of vehicle-treated mice after counterstaining with hematoxylin in cells morphologically consistent with LSECs and KCs. (
   <bold>B</bold>) NS2B expression in the liver was quantified using machine grading. (
   <bold>C</bold>) NS2B expression (green) was detected in vehicle-treated mice after counterstaining with DAPI in cells morphologically consistent with neurons and microglia. (
   <bold>D</bold>) NS2B expression was quantified using machine grading. Median and interquartile range are shown.
