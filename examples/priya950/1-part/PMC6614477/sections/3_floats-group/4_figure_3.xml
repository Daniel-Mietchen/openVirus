  <p>ZIKV-IG treatment decreases viral burden in the sciatic nerve and brain of ZIKV-infected mice. Groups of

   <sup>−/−</sup> mice (n = 6) were infected with 1.0 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of ZIKV strain FSS13025 (via r.o. route). At 24 hrs p.i., mice were treated (r.o. route) with vehicle (circle) or 50 (square) mg/kg ZIKV-IG. (
   <bold>A</bold>) ZIKV RNA levels, as measured by qRT-PCR and (
   <bold>B</bold>) infectious ZIKV levels, as determined by FFA analyses in the sciatic nerve and brain at days 3 and 7 p.i. Dotted lines indicate the limit of detection. Study groups were compared for statistical significance using Bonferroni corrected non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests for each tissue and time-point. Mean and standard error of the mean are shown.
