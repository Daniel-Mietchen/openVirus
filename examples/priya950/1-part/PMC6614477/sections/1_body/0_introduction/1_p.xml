<p id="Par2">Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus belonging to the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, similar to dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever viruses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. ZIKV was first identified in a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 and was isolated from mosquitoes (
 <italic>Aedes africanus</italic>) in 1948
 <sup>

 </sup>. ZIKV is transmitted through the bite of infected female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes

 </sup> and potentially 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>, as well as alternative non-vector routes which have been identified, including vertical (i.e., mother-to-infant)

 </sup>, and sexual transmission
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. From the 1950’s to 1990’s, serological evidence of ZIKV was reported in multiple Asian

 </sup> countries, but no outbreaks and only 14 cases of human ZIKV disease were described

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–

 </sup>. The first ZIKV outbreak was observed in 2007 on Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>, followed by a second outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. The most recent reported outbreak was on a larger scale that occurred from 2014 to 2016 in Latin America
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. Interest in this virus increased after these outbreaks in part due to the emergence of ZIKV outside its previously known geographic range, showing the potential of the virus to spread wherever the mosquito vector is present. In addition, prior to the French Polynesia outbreak, ZIKV was known to be asymptomatic or cause only mild symptoms (fever, headache, malaise, arthralgia, myalgia, maculopapular rashes, and conjunctivitis). However, since 2007, severe complications of ZIKV infection, in particular Guillain–Barré Syndrome in adults
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup> and Congenital Zika Syndrome in babies born to ZIKV-infected women

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup> have been observed. These findings led the WHO to declare ZIKV a public health emergency of international concern in 2016 and expanded efforts for the development of vaccines and therapeutics to combat the disease.
