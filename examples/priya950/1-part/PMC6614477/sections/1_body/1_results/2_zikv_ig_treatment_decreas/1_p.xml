<p id="Par6">To determine how ZIKV-IG treatment improves morbidity and mortality, we examined whether ZIKV-IG treatment reduces viral burden in sera and key target organs of ZIKV tropism (spleen, kidneys, liver, sciatic nerves, and brain). 
 <italic>Ifnar1</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice were infected with ZIKV (strain FSS13025, 1.0 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU/mouse, r.o. route) followed by treatment at 24 hrs p.i. with ZIKV-IG (50, 10, 2 and 0.5 mg/kg, r.o. route). Sera and organs were harvested on days 3 and 7 p.i., and levels of viral RNA and infectious virus to BHK cells were determined by qRT-PCR and FFA, respectively. The 0.1 mg/kg dose was not used in this experiment due to the observed similarities of mortality and morbidity between this group and the 0.5 mg/kg group. In the serum, only 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG-treated mice had significant reductions in both viral RNA (−1.1-fold, p = 0.017) and infectious virus levels (−1.8-fold, p = 0.043) at day 3 p.i. relative to vehicle-treated control mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). No significant reductions were noted in any animals treated with ≤10 mg/kg ZIKV-IG on day 3 p.i. or treated with any dose level on day 7 p.i. compared to controls, suggesting that by day 7 p.i. virus is cleared from circulation in all groups (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In the spleen, similar levels of viral RNA and BHK cell-infectious viral particles were present in all groups at day 3 p.i., but at day 7 p.i., animals treated with 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG had lower levels of viral RNA (−1.3-fold, p = 0.009) and BHK cell-infectious virus (−2.3-fold, p = 0.009) relative to vehicle-treated control mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Spleens of mice treated with 10 mg/kg ZIKV-IG (−1.3-fold, p = 0.009 for viral RNA and −1.7-fold, p = 0.009 for BHK cell-infectious ZIKV) and 2 mg/kg ZIKV-IG (−1.1-fold, p = 0.017 for viral RNA and −1.3-fold, p = 0.035 for infectious ZIKV) also contained lower levels of viral RNA and BHK cell-infectious virus than control mice at day 7 p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In the kidney, 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG treatment significantly reduced levels of viral RNA and BHK cell-infectious virus compared to controls at both day 3 p.i (−1.5-fold, p = 0.009 for viral RNA; −2.8-fold, p = 0.009 for infectious virus) and day 7 p.i. (−1.6-fold, p = 0.009 for viral RNA; −1.5-fold, p = 0.009 for infectious ZIKV) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Kidneys in animals treated with 10 mg/kg ZIKV-IG also contained decreased levels of viral RNA relative to control mice at day 3 p.i. (−1.1-fold, p = 0.035) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In the liver, 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG-treated mice had similar levels of viral RNA but lower levels of BHK cell-infectious ZIKV (−1.3-fold, p = 0.009) than control mice at day 3 p.i. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). At day 7 p.i., the liver RNA levels were significantly elevated in mice treated with 10 mg/kg (1.3-fold, p = 0.009), 2 mg/kg (1.5-fold, p = 0.009) and 0.5 mg/kg ZIKV-IG (1.3-fold, p = 0.017) as compared to control mice (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>); however, no difference in levels of BHK cell-infectious virus was observed between the liver from any of the ZIKV-IG treated groups and control mice at day 7 p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The increased viral RNA levels observed in the liver could be related to the analytical methods, as qRT-PCR detects viral RNA of both infectious and non-infectious virus particles, whereas the FFA analysis detects only BHK cell-infectious virus particles. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ZIKV-IG treatment reduces viral burden in key non-neuronal target tissues of ZIKV.
