<p id="Par8">To confirm the robust efficacy of 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG treatment against ZIKV infection in this mouse model, we next localized ZIKV in tissues by performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) for expression of ZIKV nonstructural protein 2B (NS2B), which is absent in virions and thus serves as a marker of viral replication. In the livers of control mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4Aa</xref>), NS2B was expressed in cells lining sinusoids that were morphologically consistent with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells (KC). In comparison, little to no NS2B immunoreactivity was seen in livers of mice treated with 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4Ab</xref>). Quantitative image analysis by ImageDx
 <sup>TM</sup> software showed that median positive cell density in control mice was 7.55 cells/mm
 <sup>2</sup> relative to 0.13 cells/mm
 <sup>2</sup> in 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG-treated mice (p = 0.006) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). In the brain, NS2B was expressed in cells morphologically consistent with neurons and microglia in control mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4Ca</xref>), whereas little to no NS2B immunoreactivity was seen in mice treated with 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4Cb</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed the median positive cell density in control mice was 10.88 cells/mm
 <sup>2</sup> as compared to 0.03 cells/mm
 <sup>2</sup> in 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG-treated mice (p = 0.006) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Thus, 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG treatment is effective against ZIKV infection in this highly stringent challenge model, as assessed via three different assays (qRT-PCR, FFA, and IHC). In particular, these results show that 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG treatment reduces viral burden in multiple tissues of

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice at both the early (day 3) and late (day 7) time points after infection. In comparison to 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG, lower doses of ZIKV-IG are less effective against ZIKV infection, reducing viral burden in select tissues.
