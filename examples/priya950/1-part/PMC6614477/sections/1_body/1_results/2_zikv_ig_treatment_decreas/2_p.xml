<p id="Par7">As the major consequences of ZIKV infection are related to infection of the nervous system, we next compared levels of viral RNA and BHK cell-infectious virus in the peripheral and central nervous system of ZIKV-IG-treated 
 <italic>vs</italic>. control mice. At day 3 p.i., similar levels of ZIKV RNA and infectious particles were present in the sciatic nerves of control and ZIKV-IG-treated mice, but at day 7 p.i., both viral RNA (−2.6-fold, p = 0.009) and BHK cell-infectious ZIKV (−3.2-fold, p = 0.009) levels were reduced in the sciatic nerves of animals treated with 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG relative to control mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Treatment with lower doses of ZIKV-IG also decreased levels of both viral RNA (2 mg/kg ZIKV-IG, −1.1-fold, p = 0.035) and BHK cell-infectious virus (10 mg/kg ZIKV-IG, −2.6-fold, p = 0.009) in the sciatic nerves at day 7 p.i (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In the brain, 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG treatment significantly reduced viral RNA levels at both days 3 and 7 p.i. (day 3 p.i. −4.1-fold, p = 0.009 and day 7 p.i. −1.8-fold, p = 0.009) relative to control mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Only low levels of BHK cell-infectious ZIKV were detected at day 3 p.i. in the brains of both 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG and control groups. However, at day 7 p.i., control mouse brains carried high levels of BHK cell-infectious ZIKV, and the brains from 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG-treated mice contained reduced levels of BHK cell-infectious ZIKV relative to control mice (−3.5-fold, p = 0.009) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Viral RNA (−1.3-fold, p = 0.009) and BHK cell-infectious ZIKV (−1.8-fold, p = 0.009) levels were also decreased the day 7 p.i. brains of mice treated with 10 mg/kg ZIKV-IG (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). These results are consistent with the sciatic nerves and brain being major target organs of ZIKV at a later time point post infection in this mouse model, and show that ZIKV-IG treatment reduces viral burden in both peripheral and central nervous tissues.
