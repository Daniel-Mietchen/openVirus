 <sup>−/−</sup> mice. Therefore, to evaluate the extent of brain tissue pathology and other signs of injury in ZIKV-IG-treated and control mice following ZIKV infection, hematoxylin &amp; eosin-stained brain slide sections were examined and scored by a blinded board-certified pathologist. Scores for these sections are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The most significant and severe lesions seen in the brains of the control group included nonsuppurative encephalitis, gliosis, nonsuppurative meningitis, neuronal necrosis, and malacia (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). In contrast, little or no pathology was observed in mice treated with 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG. Thus, treatment with 50 mg/kg ZIKV-IG reduces ZIKV-induced brain pathology (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).
