<p id="Par10">In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of human anti-ZIKV pAb (ZIKV-IG) against lethal ZIKV infection in a highly stringent mouse model. ZIKV-IG treatment was effective in protecting mice against ZIKV-induced mortality and morbidity by decreasing viral replication and dissemination into key target organs and ZIKV-induced pathology in the brain. These findings support further development of ZIKV-IG as a candidate for prophylaxis or treatment of Zika disease.</p>
