 </sup> were employed for manufacturing of ZIKV-IG (lot PD_740_ZKP_16_001_003_ER_v1) used in this study. This lot contained a total protein concentration of 54 mg/mL (&gt;98.9% human IgG). Potency was determined using a microneutralization assay that measured the cytopathic effect of ZIKV strain PRVABC59 on Vero E6 cells using an xCELLigence® real-time cell analyzer (RTCA, ACEA Biosciences Inc.). Briefly, Vero E6 cells were added to an xCELLigence 96-well electronic microtiter plate (E-plate) then pre-incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. The E-plate contains electrodes in each well; adherent cells in the wells impede the electric current passing through the electrodes. An equal volume of ZIKV PRVABC59, diluted to 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>, was incubated for one hour at 37 °C with serial dilutions of ZIKV-IG, then added to the E-plate. The E-plate was then incubated at 37 °C in an xCELLigence unit contained in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Cells were monitored in real-time by measuring ZIKV-induced changes in cell impedance at 30-minute intervals. Sample dilution data from the defined end point was analyzed by fitting the impedance measure (cell index) to the log dilution using a 4-parameter logistic curve fit to determine the 50% neutralizing titer (NT
 <sub>50</sub>). The initial potency value for ZIKV-IG product was 18,480, indicating a high degree of Zika virus neutralization.
