<p id="Par27">Paraffinized liver was cut onto slides (4 μm) and routinely deparaffinized. Slides were microwaved (GE, Model#: JES1142WD04) on high setting in Antigen Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories) and cooled at room temperature. Endogenous enzyme activity was blocked with BLOXALL (Vector Laboratories) and nonspecific protein binding was blocked with 10% Normal Goat Serum (Thermo Fisher). Slides were incubated with anti-ZIKV NS2B Ab (Genetex) at 4 °C for 14 hrs. Slides were incubated with ImmPRESS HRP (Vector Laboratories) secondary Ab followed by incubation with ImmPACT NovaRED (Vector Laboratories) substrate. Slides were counterstained with Modified Mayer’s Hematoxylin (Thermo Fisher) and routinely processed for mounting. Positive, negative, and rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) controls were included with each batch. Morphology of immuno-reactive cells were confirmed by a board-certified pathologist, and immunoreactivity was quantified by ImageDx
 <sup>TM</sup> (Reveal Biosciences).
