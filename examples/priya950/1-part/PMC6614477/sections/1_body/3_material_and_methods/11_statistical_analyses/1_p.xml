<p id="Par29">Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.3 statistical software (SAS). Survival rates and median time to death (MTD) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Data were analyzed either with Fisher’s exact test (survival), Log-rank test (MTD) or exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test (viral RNA and infectious virus). All these tests were followed by a Bonferroni correction. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence data for both brain and liver were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test with Dwass, Steel, Critchlow-Fligner correction for multiple comparisons. Results were considered significant when p &lt; 0.05.</p>
