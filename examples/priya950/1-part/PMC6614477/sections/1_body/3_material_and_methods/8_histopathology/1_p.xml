<p id="Par26">At the time of necropsy, liver and brain were collected in 10% zinc formalin (BBC Biochemical) for histopathologic evaluation. Tissues were fixed for 48 hrs at room temperature. Brains were cut transversely at points corresponding to Bregma +2 mm and Bregma −3 mm of Mouse Brain Atlas celloidin case #170 (

Tissues were processed routinely for paraffinization and cut at 4 μm thickness for H&amp;E staining. Slides were blinded before review with an Olympus BX40 brightfield microscope at 2-60X magnification. Lesions were graded on a 4-point scale (0 to +++). All categories of lesions were tabulated (Table
