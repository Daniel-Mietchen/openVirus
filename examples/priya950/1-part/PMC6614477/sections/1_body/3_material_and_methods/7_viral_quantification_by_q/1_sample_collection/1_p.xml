<p id="Par23">Viral quantification was conducted by qRT-PCR and by Focus Forming Assay (FFA) on serum, spleen, kidney, liver, sciatic nerve, and brain. Sera were collected after centrifugation (15,900 g for 15 min at 4 °C) of blood harvested by cardiac puncture into collection tubes (Sarstedt, #41.1500.005). Following mouse perfusion with PBS, tissues were harvested and stored either in tubes containing RNA Later (Invitrogen) for qRT-PCR or in pre-weighed tubes containing MEMα medium and steel beads (Qiagen, #69989) for FFA. Tissues were then homogenized in RTL buffer (Qiagen) + 1% beta mercaptoethanol for qRT-PCR and MEMα medium for FFA followed by clarification (centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min).</p>
