<p id="Par28">At the time of necropsy, brains were collected in 4% paraformaldehyde (Alfa Aesar) at 4 °C and allowed to fix for 24 hrs. Tissues were then cryoprotected by serial immersion in 15% sucrose (Affymetrix) followed by 20% sucrose until the brains floated. Brains were cut transversely at points corresponding to Bregma +2 mm and Bregma −3 mm of Mouse Brain Atlas celloidin case #170 (

Tissues were transferred to cryomolds, embedded in OCT (Electron Microscopy Services), and frozen on dry ice followed by −80 °C freezer. Tissues were cut at 10 μm thickness for immunofluorescence. Slides were microwaved (GE, Model#: JES1142WD04) on high setting in Antigen Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories) and cooled at room temperature. Slides were incubated in Tris-Urea buffer and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Acros Organics). Nonspecific protein binding was blocked with 10% Horse Serum (Thermo Fisher). Slides were incubated with anti-ZIKV NS2B Ab (Genetex) at 4 °C for 14 hrs, followed by incubation with anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen) secondary Ab and DAPI (Invitrogen) counterstain. Cover slips were mounted with Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). Positive, negative, and rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) controls were included with each batch. Morphology of cells in the brains was confirmed by a board-certified pathologist. Brain immunoreactivity was quantified by ImageDx
 <sup>TM</sup> (Reveal Biosciences).
