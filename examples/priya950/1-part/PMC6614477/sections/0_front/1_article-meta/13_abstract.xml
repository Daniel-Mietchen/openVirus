 <p id="Par1">Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that represents a major threat to global health. ZIKV infections in adults are generally asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms. However, recent outbreaks of ZIKV have revealed that it can cause Congenital Zika Syndrome in neonates and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. Currently, no ZIKV-specific vaccines or antiviral treatments are available. In this study, we tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma IgG hyperimmune product (ZIKV-IG) isolated from individuals with high neutralizing anti-ZIKV titers as a therapeutic candidate against ZIKV infection using a model of ZIKV infection in

  <sup>−/−</sup> mice. ZIKV-IG successfully protected mice from lethal ZIKV challenge. In particular, ZIKV-IG treatment at 24 hours after lethal ZIKV infection improved survival by reducing weight loss and tissue viral burden and improving clinical score. Additionally, ZIKV-IG eliminated ZIKV-induced tissue damage and inflammation in the brain and liver. These results indicate that ZIKV-IG is efficacious against ZIKV, suggesting this human polyclonal antibody is a viable candidate for further development as a treatment against human ZIKV infection.
