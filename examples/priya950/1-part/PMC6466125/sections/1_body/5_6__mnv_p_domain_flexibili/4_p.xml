<p>An even more extreme case of P domain plasticity was observed with a second neutralizing antibody, 2D3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00235-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Compared to A6.2, MNV1 had far more difficulty in overcoming neutralization to 2D3, as it took over 20 passages for MNV1 to escape mAb 2D3 neutralization [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The escape mutants to A6.2 were still neutralized by 2D3 and visa-versa. Importantly, all of the MNV strains tested were neutralized to at least some degree by 2D3 while A6.2 was far more selective. This suggested that the epitope on the P domain region recognized by 2D3 was significantly different and more conserved than that for A6.2 and would therefore make a good vaccine target.
