<p>These studies have shown that the Calicivirus capsid is not merely a “tin can” moving viral genome from cell to cell. Instead, it a highly dynamic virus that appears to have a highly mobile P domain that can move around the capsid surface, likely to facilitate binding to the target cell. This flexibility of the P domain might also be involved in avoiding the immune system by presenting antigenic sites exposed in one state but not the other. There is similarly a high degree of mobility within the P domain with it adopting a spectrum of conformations depending upon various environmental cues. This flexibility may be to help it target the best tissue for infection. It might even be used to confuse the immune system by presenting a wide array of structures. In essence, could the virus be presenting one “face” to the immune system while adopting a very different one for cell attachment depending upon the environment?</p>
