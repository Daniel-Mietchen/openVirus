<p>The structure of human JAM-1 (hJAM-1) has been determined to atomic resolution [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the crystal cell, the two D1 Ig-like domains interact at ~90Â° angles akin to what is observed in antibody structures. The D2 domains interact with different copies of the hJAM-1 proteins in an anti-parallel fashion. For a number of reasons, including possible interactions with reoviruses, it was suggested that these D1 interactions might be dynamic in nature. The structure of human JAM-1 was altered to reflect the sequence of fJAM-1 and fitted into the electron density envelope of the FCV/fJAM-1 complex [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Unlike the interactions observed in the crystal structure of hJAM-1, the model suggests that two copies of fJAM-1 bind to the outermost portion of the P2 dimers in a crossed manner such that the D1 domain from one bound molecule interacts with the D2 domain of the other. The current model, however, places these two domains fairly close together in some regions. Again, this model places a single D1 domain at the viral surface rather than the D1 dimers observed in the crystal structure. fJAM-1 interacts with the known hypervariable antigenic loops of P2 and those residues in fJAM-1 involved in these contacts have been shown to be important for virus binding.
