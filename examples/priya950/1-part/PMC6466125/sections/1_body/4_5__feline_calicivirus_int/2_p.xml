<p>The cryo-TEM structure of FCV complexed with fJAM-1 was determined to a resolution of ~18Ã… [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While the general structure agreed well with the atomic structure of SMSV, it is interesting that either alone or complexed with fJAM-1, the C/C dimers were less ordered than the A/B dimers. In particular there was apparent disorder around the flexible junction between the S and P domains of the capsid protein.
