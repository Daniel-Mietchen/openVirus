<p>This work has been updated with very recent and exciting cryo-EM studies on the FCV/VP2 complex [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In these cryo-electron microscopy studies, they found that the minor capsid protein, VP2, forms a large portal-like structure at a unique three-fold axis of symmetry, following receptor binding. This complex is not observed in the absence of receptor and is formed of twelve copies of VP2, with their hydrophobic N termini pointing away from the virion surface. Further, they suggest that structural changes at the portal site opens a pore in the capsid shell. They hypothesize that this portal acts as a channel to deliver the viral genome through the endosomal membrane. While it has shown that VP2 is critical for the production of infectious virus [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], this is the first time a detailed mode of action has been proposed. It should be noted that the FCV cryo-EM structure has the “compressed” structure, although the P domains are clearly flexible with regard to the capsid surface. This suggests that, at least for FCV, that the compressed state might be conformation required for cell binding.
