<p>Feline calicivirus (FCV) causes respiratory illness and stomatitis in cats [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. FCV interacts with a 2,6 sialic acid [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These glycan interactions are thought to be important but unlikely to represent the sole cellular receptor for the virus. Feline junctional adhesion molecule 1 (fJAM-1) was identified as the functional receptor for FCV [

 <italic>Caliciviruses</italic> as demonstrated by studies showing that transfection of the fJAM-1 gene into non-permissive cells transferred sensitivity to infection that was blocked by antibodies to fJAM-1. JAM-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin-like superfamily of proteins found on the surface of leukocytes and blood platelets and is thought to regulate the formation of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Domain deletion and mutagenesis experiments have mapped the virus interactions to outermost D1 domain [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is interesting to note that bacterially expressed fJAM-1, which is devoid of any glycan modifications, is able to inhibit virus binding to cells [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This would suggest that the sialic acid on fJAM-1 is not necessary for binding of the receptor to FCV.
