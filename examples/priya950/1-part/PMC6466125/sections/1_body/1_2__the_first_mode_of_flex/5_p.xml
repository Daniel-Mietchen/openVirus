<p>The conservation of this unique flexibility of the P domain across 
 <italic>Calicivirus</italic> genera, antibody recognition of buried epitopes, and receptor interactions all strongly suggest that P domain flexibility plays some critical role in the 
 <italic>Calicivirus</italic> life cycle. While studies are underway to ascertain this function, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00235-f005">Figure 5</xref> summarizes a few of the possibilities. It seems highly likely that the 
 <italic>Caliciviruses</italic> can adopt both conformations depending upon environmental cues. As suggested in this figure, the viruses might prefer the compressed or expanded state when binding to the cell surface. In this way, the virus may become primed for cell attachment when in the appropriate location in the gut. From the recent MNV P domain/ CD300lf structure [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], it appears that CD300lf binding does not favor the expanded conformation and the flexibility of the P domain helps to optimize receptor binding. It should be noted that when the P domains rise off the shell, they also rotate by nearly 90Â°. Therefore, not only are there differences in flexibility between these two states, but also in the relative orientations of the various binding sites on the P domain.
