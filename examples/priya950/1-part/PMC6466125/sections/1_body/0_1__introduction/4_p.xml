<p>The purpose of this review is to examine recent results demonstrating that the Calicivirus capsid is a dynamic structure and that this flexibility may play important roles in receptor binding and escape from immune surveillance. From these studies, there are at least two aspects of capsid flexibility; the entire P domain freely moves about the capsid surface and the conformation of the P domain itself is highly flexible and sensitive to antibody escape mutations and receptor binding.</p>
