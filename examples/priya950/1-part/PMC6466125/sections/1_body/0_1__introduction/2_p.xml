<p>Efforts to make effective norovirus vaccines have been thwarted by our lack of understanding of the structural mechanisms of viral escape. In addition, noroviruses are constantly evolving and generate new strains every 2â€“4 years [

Developing efficacious vaccines requires a detailed understanding of how escape mutations block antibody binding and the limitations in altering the virus capsid to evade the immune system. Such studies have been difficult with human noroviruses. While there have been advances in cell culture methods [
