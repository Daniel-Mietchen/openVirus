<p>Panel D shows a comparison between the MNV P domain/CD300lf/GCDCA complex [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the human norovirus GII.1 (mauve) complexed with GCDCA [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. What is particularly interesting is that human GII.1 binds GCDCA (mauve spheres) at the very top of the P2 domain rather than at the dimer interface closer to the P1 domain. Importantly, GCDCA in GII.1 overlaps with the location of CD300lf in MNV and is immediately adjacent to the HGBA binding location in human norovirus GII. Indeed, these authors suggested that bile salts cause conformational changes in these upper P2 domain loops that allow the polysaccharides to bind [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and allow some genotypes to bind HGBAâ€™s that they were unable bind previously. Therefore, while the details are different, both GII.1 and MNV are clearly dynamic proteins in conformational equilibriums. External stimuli appear to be able to alter this equilibrium to favor receptor binding.
