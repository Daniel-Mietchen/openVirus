 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00235-f009">Figure 9</xref> shows a possible model for the structural dynamics within the P domain. The conformation of the P domain in solution is more than likely a montage of structures including the observed open and closed configurations. This model suggests that the structural equilibrium can be disrupted by environmental cues and antibody escape mutants. In the open conformation, the A’-B’ and E’-F’ loops are splayed apart making room for antibodies (e.g., A6.2 and 2D3) to bind. The closed conformation does not expose the hydrophobic region between the two loops and the E’-F’ loop clashes with the CDR3 loop, therefore preventing antibody binding. All of the escape mutations to 2D3 are distal to the antibody binding contact and dynamic simulation studies with the V339I escape mutation suggest that it is causes long range structural disruption in the P domain dimer and may be pushing the structure from the open (that binds antibody) to the closed (that does not bind antibody) conformation [

Interestingly, the location of V339I is immediately adjacent to the bile salt binding site in MNV and may be mimicking the effects of bile salts. While clearly this simplistic model needs to be extensively tested, it suggests that the P domain in solution is sampling many conformations waiting for the right environmental cues when in the best location of the animal for infection. It is fascinating that apparently the predominant structure presented to, or recognized by, the immune system is the open conformation while the conformation necessary for receptor binding is closed. This could be akin to the ‘camouflage’ model proposed to FMDV where the integrin binding RGD motif is on a highly mobile loop that presents many different conformations to the immune system [
