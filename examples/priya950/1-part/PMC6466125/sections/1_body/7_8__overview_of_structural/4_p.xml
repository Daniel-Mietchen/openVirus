<p>Panel C shows the binding locations of CD300lf (green) and the neutralizing antibody 2D3 (pink) with respect to the bile salt binding site. This figure is rotated 90° compared to panels A and B and is hypothetical since the receptor and antibody do not bind at the same time. As this figure shows, the two proteins do not bind to the exactly the same location on the P domain but the main body of the proteins are too close together to bind simultaneously. It should be noted, however, that whether antibodies overlap the binding site of CD300lf in the case of MNV or HGBA’s in the case of human noroviruses, neither circumstances are likely to be necessary for antibody efficacy. As discussed previously [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], it must be remembered that the length of an intact antibody is approximately the radius of these particles and therefore binding is likely to greatly affect the closest approach of the virus to the cell surface regardless of the exact binding location on the virus. Further, in-vivo, binding alone is sufficient for recognition by the other immune system components. Therefore, the locations of antibody binding are likely to be more critical with regard to binding affinity and viral protein conservation than whether the paratopes overlap receptor binding. This figure also exemplifies how far the V339I escape mutant and GCDCA are to antibody and receptor binding sites. The only explanation for how this escape mutant works is that the P domain is a highly dynamic structure that can be affected by ligands and mutants in an allosteric manner.
