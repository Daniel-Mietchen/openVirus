 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00235-f008">Figure 8</xref> shows a summary of some of the structural studies on norovirus P domain. In panel A, the open (red) and closed (blue) conformations of the MNV P domain monomers are compared. Shown in grey is the other copy of the P domain that forms the dimer. Note that the A’-B’ and E’-F’ loops are splayed apart in the open (red) conformation but tightly associated in the closed (blue) conformation. The structure of the tip of the P domain in solution is more than likely to exist in a structural equilibrium including at least these two conformations.
