  <p>The P domain is observed to be “floating” above the shell surface in several different genotypes. Shown here are the cryo-EM image reconstructions of MNV, RHDV, and human Vietnam026 and of the crystal structure of NV. The gap between the P domains and the shell in these viruses are noted by the mauve arrows. The surface of NV is calculated from the atomic structure and all of the images are colored according the distance from the center of the particle. Note that while the P domain of NV is not detached from the shell, it contains the flexible linker between the P domain and the shell as in the other genotypes.</p>
