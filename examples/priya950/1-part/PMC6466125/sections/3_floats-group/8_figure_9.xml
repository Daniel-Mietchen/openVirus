  <p>Model for intrinsic conformational dynamics within the P domain. In this highly simplistic overview, there are at least two conformation for the P domain; open (red) and closed (blue). The antibodies to date that neutralize MNV appear to only bind to the open conformation while the receptor appears to prefer binding to the closed conformation. From the results reviewed here, it appears that the structural equilibrium is shifted towards the receptor-binding closed state by some of the “allosteric” antibody escape mutations and by external stimuli such as bile salts and metals like calcium.</p>
