  <p>Dynamic simulations of the natural escape mutation to 2D3, V339I. Since V339I blocks 2D3 binding but is very distal to the antibody binding site, dynamic simulation calculations were performed to see the effects of V339I on the structure of the P domain dimer. The open conformation is red and the closed is blue with the darker hues representing the initial structure before the simulations. The location of V339I is shown in tan and the other escape mutant, D348E, in yellow. Compared to simulations on the wild type P domain structure, several notable changes were observed. There were disruptions in the hydrogen bonds between the dimers (cyan spheres) and the A’-B’ and E’-F’ loops in the open conformation started to approach that of the closed conformation.
