 <caption>
  <p>Comparisons of various P domain structures and complexes. Panel (
   <bold>A</bold>) shows an overlay of the open (red) and closed (blue) conformations observed in the MNV P domain crystal structure [
   <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00235" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Panel (
   <bold>B</bold>) shows an overlay of the MNV P domain (tan ribbon) with receptor (green ribbon) and bile salts (tan spheres) onto the closed conformation (blue) from panel A. Also shown is the location of the V339I escape mutation to antibody 2D3 (black spheres). Note that the conformations of the A’-B’ and E’-F’ loops with the bound receptor is nearly identical to that of the closed conformation in panel (
   <bold>A</bold>). Also note that the V339I escape mutate is immediately adjacent to the bound bile salts. Panel (
   <bold>C</bold>) shows a hypothetical overlay of the P domain with 2D3 antibody (pink) and CD300lf receptor (green) bound. While their binding sites do not directly overlap, it is impossible for both to bind simultaneously. Panel (
   <bold>D</bold>) shows an overlay of the MNV receptor complex (tan) with the human P domain complexed with bile salts (mauve). Note that CD300lf in MNV directly overlaps the bound GCDCA in the human norovirus structure.
