<p>Only recently have hierarchical models been used for modelling multiple epidemics, for instance with the joint analysis of six smallpox epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], for transmissibility and duration of carriage in the analysis of multistrain pneumococcus carriage [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], or for forecasting seasonal influenza [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Other modelling papers specifically attempted to take advantage of the similarities between different 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases, e.g., by estimating the risk of acquiring chikungunya from the prevalence of dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] or by assesssing the spatio-temporal coherence of chikungunya, Zika and dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Also, using informative priors to make up for the lack of information during the early stages of an epidemic has been done before. For instance, 
 <italic>a priori</italic> information from the ZIKV epidemics in French Polynesia has been used to support the early forecasts of health-care requirements for the ZIKV epidemic in Martinique [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this case, however, authors concluded that a prior built from an epidemic in a different location resulted in inaccurate predictions at the early stage. We found a similar result in a sensitivity analysis: the direct use of information from ZIKV in French Polynesia, or alternatively the direct use of information from CHIKV in the French West Indies, without adjusting for ZIKV, leads to poor overall forecasting quality compared to the L prior considered here (
