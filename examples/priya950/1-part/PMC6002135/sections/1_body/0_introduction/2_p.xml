<p>Several methods have been used to make epidemic predictions, including exponential growth models [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], sigmoid-based extrapolations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], SIR-type models [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and more realistic model accounting for spatial and population structure [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. But in addition to specifying a model, selecting good parameter values is also essential to obtain good predictions. In models for directly transmitted diseases, this can come from realistic demographic and behavioral characteristics, for example the contact frequency between individuals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], mobility patterns [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and from clinical and epidemiological characteristics like the duration of the serial interval [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Such information is less easily available and more limited for mosquito-transmitted diseases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, outbreaks of the same disease or diseases with similar routes of transmission may have occurred in the same or similar locations, so that relevant information may be recovered from the analysis of past outbreaks.
