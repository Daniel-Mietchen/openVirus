<p>The aa sequence of NP is conserved up to 90%, among various strains of influenza and heterosubtypic immunity (HSI) induced by this protein has been fully demonstrated in the mouse model, a feature that had been totally attributed to T cells (

 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). However, Rangel-Moreno et al. reported that T cells are insufficient to achieve HSI, and they proposed that non-neutralizing Abs contribute to decrease the severity of the illness by lowering viral titers, decreasing weight loss, and promoting the recovery of mice by helping CD8 T cells to expand after the heterosubtypic challenge (

Furthermore, Carragher et al. analyzed the role of anti-NP Abs on HSI by vaccinating mice in the absence of T cells with recombinant nucleoprotein (rNP). They found that HSI was still present. However, it was lost when the Abs were absent, and it was recovered by transfer of rNP-immune serum (
