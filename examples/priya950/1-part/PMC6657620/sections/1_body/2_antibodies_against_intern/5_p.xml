<p>Finally, other internal and non-structural proteins like PA-X and PB1-F2 have shown to induce Abs, even though their role in protection has not been determined. In 2012, protein PA-X was identified as a product of the ribosomal frameshifting of IAV segment 3, and, at least in animal models, it modulates viral growth and suppresses antiviral responses. In 2016, the first evidence of PA-X expression in humans was the high titers of specific Abs to this protein found in sera from patients infected during the 2003 H7N7 outbreak occurred in The Netherlands (
