<p>Anti-NA Abs have historically been underestimated, due to the central role that HA has played in influenza research. However, for the last 50 years, important data have been gathered suggesting that anti-NA Abs can offer protection against the influenza infection. In 1968, Schulman et al. demonstrated that Abs against this protein are produced in mice after an IAV infection. The outcome of an infection in na√Øve mice improved when NA-immune serum was transferred to them (

Later, Murphy et al. investigated the role of anti-NA Abs in a clinical study carried out with volunteers, with low basal levels of anti-HA Abs and variable levels of anti-NA Abs. These subjects were infected with influenza virus A/NT/60/68 (H3N2), and the authors observed that the individuals who displayed minimal symptoms had higher levels of anti-NA Abs (
