<p>It is well-known that the gold standard for evaluation of vaccine efficacy is the HAI titer, where a value ≥40 is taken as protective by the FDA in the United States (

Nonetheless and despite the lack of data regarding the contribution of anti-NA Abs in protection, Memoly et al. studied in humans the role of the NAI titer levels in predicting protection against influenza. They found that the same value of NAI titers (≥40) correlated better with the prediction of protection, even at higher levels than the HAI titer, which is only associated to a reduction of virus shedding. High levels of NAI titers also correlated with the reduction of the viral load and the duration and severity of the infection, among other symptoms (
