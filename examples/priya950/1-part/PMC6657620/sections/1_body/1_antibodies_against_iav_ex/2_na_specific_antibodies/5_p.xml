<p>In the case of anti-NA Abs, there is also evidence of original antigenic sin. As stated previously, during the last IAV pandemic (pH1N1/2009), there was a low incidence of illness among elderly people. This was attributed to their previous exposure to similar IAV strains during childhood, which induced a recall response to the conserved domains of HA present in the strains. Similarly, Marcelin et al. found that NAI Abs were present in the sera from older people, and seroconversion was only registered in the age group â‰¥ 70 years after TIV vaccination. This provides evidence that NA-specific B cells from past strains were activated by the pH1N1/2009 virus, and they contributed to the protection process (

In the same way, Rajendran et al., found that anti-NA Abs levels are directly proportional to age, and their reactivity are highest against influenza virus strains that more likely circulated during their childhood [A/South Carolina/1/1918 (H1N1), and A/Singapore/1/1957 (H2N2) in elderly; A/USSR/92/1977 (H1N1) and A/Philippines/2/1982 (H3N2) in adults] (
