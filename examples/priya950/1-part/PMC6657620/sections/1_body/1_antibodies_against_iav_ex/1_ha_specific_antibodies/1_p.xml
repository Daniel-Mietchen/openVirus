<p>HA from influenza viruses is a spike-shaped protein that extends from the surface of the virus. The HA precursor (HA0) trimerizes in the ER and in the virion surface is processed by tissue trypsin generating two polypeptides: HA1 and HA2, which interact through disulfide bonds. HA1 comprises the globular region of the molecule (head), which contains the RBS, and the upper part of the stem region. HA2 covers the major part of the stem region, and it contains the fusion peptide. Currently, 18 different serological IAV HA subtypes have been described, and they have been divided into two phylogenetic groups: group 1 (including H1, H2, H5) and group 2 (including H3 and H7). In humans, H1 and H3 are the most frequent HAs present in circulating strains, and they are the main components of inactivated seasonal vaccines. However, some HAs from avian viruses such as H5 and H7 (e.g., H5N1 and H7N9) have crossed the interspecies barrier infecting humans and causing occasional outbreaks (
