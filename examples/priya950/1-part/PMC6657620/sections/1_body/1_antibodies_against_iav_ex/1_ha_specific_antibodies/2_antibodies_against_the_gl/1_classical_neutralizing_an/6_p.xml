<p>An example of OAS was observed in the most recent pandemic caused by an IAV H1N1 in 2009 (pH1N1/2009). As previously stated, the HA head does not induce a high level of cross-reactivity. However, the frequency of severe disease among elderly people infected with the pandemic strain was lower than it was among younger individuals, suggesting preexisting immunity. In this regard, IAV HA is more closely related to the 1918 pandemic virus A/South Carolina/1/1918 (H1N1) than HAs from seasonal strains, and those individuals who more likely experienced pre-1957 H1N1 strains had higher titers of neutralizing Abs to the 2009 H1N1 strain (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). An interesting fact was that the main antigenic determinants of these Abs were located on the Sa site of the globular domain of HA, shared between the 1918 and 2009 strains (
