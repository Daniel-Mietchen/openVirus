<p>Abs elicited against the HA globular domain during infection or vaccination usually are strain-specific, and they will hardly neutralize subsequent influenza virus strains (homosubtypic protection). This is explained by the selective pressure exerted by the immune system, which leads to the rise of new strains (with minor amino acid substitutions in the five neutralizing sites of HA head) that can avoid previous Abs (escape mutants). This evolutionary mechanism (antigenic drift) makes it necessary the annual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines.</p>
