<p>Additionally, the repertoire of B cells from individuals vaccinated in consecutive years with the pandemic strain pH1N1/2009 was analyzed by Andrews et al. They showed that the individuals with low basal levels of Abs specific for this strain generated a broadly reactive response directed mainly against the HA stem. On the other hand, individuals with high levels of Abs before vaccination correlated with a dominant response against the HA head domain after immunization. The authors suggest that the repertoire of anti-stem B cell memory is preexistent and that the immunodominance of the HA globular domain prevails with the subsequent encounters with the influenza virus (

This observation echoes the dilemma of producing a universal vaccine that promotes the generation of anti-stem Abs or rather using the Abs in passive immunization strategies in infected individuals, since it is possible that consecutive challenges with seasonal strains of influenza will move the balance in favor of anti-head Abs.
