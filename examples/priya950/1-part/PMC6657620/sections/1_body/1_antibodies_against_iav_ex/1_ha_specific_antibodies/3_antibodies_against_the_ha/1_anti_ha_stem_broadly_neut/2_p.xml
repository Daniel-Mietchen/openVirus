<p>Most human anti-stem Abs, particularly those against HAs from group 1 (e.g., CR6261 and F10), use the V
 <sub>H1−69</sub> gene family. These broadly reactive Abs are characterized by a phenylalanine in position 54 at the HCDR2 region unique to the V
 <sub>H1−69</sub> gene. This provides them with a unique ability to form hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic groove between HA1 and HA2, using only their heavy chains. Thus, they inhibit the conformational changes necessary for the fusion of viral-cell membranes (
