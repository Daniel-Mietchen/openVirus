<p>Using a mouse model, it was shown by Angeletti et al., that there is a hierarchy among the five antigenic sites of the HA molecule of PR8 virus (H1N1), that depends on the immune response progress, the genetic background and the way in which the antigen is formulated and delivered: Cb-specific B-cells are predominant in the immediate response after infection, but they are substituted by Sb-specific B-cells at day 21. This hierarchy was not influenced by CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and it may change with different administration routes and different strains of mice (

Later, Liu et al., analyzed the hierarchy of immunodominance for the HA of a post-2009 influenza pandemic strain, A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) in several species including humans: while no specific immunodominance pattern was found with guinea pigs, Sb and Ca-specific Abs dominated the immune response in mice and the site Sa was dominant in ferrets. For humans it was reported a completely different pattern in which Sa and Sb-specific Abs dominated the antibody response (

Similarly, for H3 virus, Broecker et al. found that the B site (analog to sites Sa and Sb in H1 HA) in the HA protein of the H3N2 strain that circulated in the 2017â€“2108 season was immunodominant pre and post-vaccination in humans that received seasonal vaccine. The same pattern of immunodominance was found with mice, but unlike reported by Angeletti et al., it was independent of genetic background and immunization route (
