<p>It is well-known that anti-stem Abs are less permissive to virus escape, but Choi et al. identified three escape mutants in virus strain A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) after it was co-cultured 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with the human mAb 39.29, which neutralizes all IAV subtypes. The authors described that mutant Gly387Lys totally eradicates the antibody binding, while mutants Asp391Tyr and Asp391Gly increase the ability of HA to fuse membranes with just a slight interference in binding at low pH (
