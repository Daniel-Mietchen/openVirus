<p>In the same way, the human mAb CH65 was isolated from an adult resident of the United States that had received the 2007 TIV. According to crystallographic studies with the A/H1N1/Solomon Islands/3/2006 strain, CH65 Ab mimics the physiologic interaction between sialic acid and HA, as this antibody binds directly to the sialic-acid pocket through its HCDR3. In this report, CH65 neutralized 30 out of 36 influenza H1N1 strains

The mAb C05 binds directly to RBS on HA using mainly its HCDR3 and with minor interaction through its HCDR1, and is capable to neutralize group 1 and group 2 influenza virus strains (
