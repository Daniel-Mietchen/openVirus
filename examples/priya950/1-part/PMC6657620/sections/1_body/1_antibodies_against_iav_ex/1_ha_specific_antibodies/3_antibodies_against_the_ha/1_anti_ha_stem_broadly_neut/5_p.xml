<p>Although the occurrence of anti-stem Abs is low after a seasonal infection or vaccination, several reports indicate that these Abs are boosted after sequential infections or immunizations with viruses containing different types of globular HA, but essentially the same stem HA (

Recently, Nachbagauer et al. analyzed the cross-reactivity pattern of anti-HA Abs after an influenza infection in patients diagnosed with pH1N1/2009 or seasonal H3N2, and they found that a pH1N1 infection induces a broader response (against group 1 and group 2 HAs) than an H3N2 infection does. This can be explained because the 2009 pandemic strain had a novel HA head, compared with that of seasonal viruses, and thus, could boost the response against the HA stem region (
