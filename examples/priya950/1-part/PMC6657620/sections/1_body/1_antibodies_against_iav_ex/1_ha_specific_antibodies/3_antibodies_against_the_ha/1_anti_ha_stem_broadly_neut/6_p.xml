<p>With respect to the 2009 pandemic vaccination, Cortina Ceballos et al. analyzed the B cell repertoire in individuals, with no previous exposure to pH1N1/2009, after they received the monovalent inactivated vaccine containing the pandemic strain (09 MIV). They reported heterosubtypic neutralizing seroconversion in 17% of the individuals. The phenomenon was associated to a clonal expansion of B cells that used the V
 <sub>H1âˆ’69</sub> segment and to other cells involved in the generation of anti-stem Abs (

They observed high levels of cross-reactivity against the HA-stem domain. This cross-reactivity pattern occurred in the case of pandemic vaccination, and it was not seen with the seasonal TIV. Furthermore, they found that, just like seasonal vaccines (TIV), anti-stem Abs had arisen from preexisting memory B cells even before the emergence of the 2009 pandemic virus, which suggests that they were induced by previous strains (
