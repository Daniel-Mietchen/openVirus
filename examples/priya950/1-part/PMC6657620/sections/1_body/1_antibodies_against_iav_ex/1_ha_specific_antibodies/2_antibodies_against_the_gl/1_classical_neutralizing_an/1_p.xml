<p>Most of the classical neutralizing Abs against influenza are directed to the conformational epitopes on HA, particularly the globular domain, which has been well-characterized as the immunodominant region of this protein. Since the early eighties, using monoclonal Abs (mAbs) as a tool, five non-overlapping sites (Sb, Sa, Ca1, Ca2 and Cb, or A-E sites) were identified as the major regions recognized by neutralizing Abs (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Sites Sa and Sb are located at the top of the globular domain of HA, while Ca1, Ca2, and Cb are located at the bottom of the head (
