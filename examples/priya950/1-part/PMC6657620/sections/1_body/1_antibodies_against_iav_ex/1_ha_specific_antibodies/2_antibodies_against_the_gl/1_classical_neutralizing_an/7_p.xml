<p>Despite the fact that the term OAS was proposed almost 60 years ago, it is still valid, and elucidating the role of this phenomenon in infection and vaccination processes continues to be relevant. In a recent study Lindermann and Hensley found by using serum passive-transfer experiments in a mouse model, that Abs with an OAS phenotype were effective in neutralizing antigenically different influenza virus strains

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Further studies are necessary to determine more precisely the role of OAS after infection or vaccination against IAV.
