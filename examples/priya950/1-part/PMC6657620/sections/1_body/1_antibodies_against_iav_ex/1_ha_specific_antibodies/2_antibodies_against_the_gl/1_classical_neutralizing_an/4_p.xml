<p>Only specific Abs for the head of HA efficiently prevent infection, by blocking the HA-mediated attachment to the cell surface (

Several authors have found both in humans and mice that anti-HA Abs can also interfere with the activity of neuraminidase (NA) by blocking virus binding to the surface bound NA-substrate or by sterically inhibiting NA access to the substrates (
