<p>The human mAb FI6 recognizes both groups of HAs, since it is able to bind to their fusion peptide. This mAb was isolated from human plasmablasts. Its heavy and light chains correspond to the V
 <sub>H</sub>3-30
 <sup>*</sup>18 and V
 <sub>K</sub>4-1
 <sup>*</sup>01 gene families, respectively. Although this mAbs binding site overlaps with that of mAb CR6261/ F10, FI6 makes contact only with the HCDR3 region, while CR6261/F10 encompasses all three HCDR regions (

 <sub>H</sub>4-59 family and displays specificity to both HA groups. Although it binds to the HA2 A-helix, apparently it does not inhibit the virus entry. Instead, it binds to HA on the surface of the infected cells, thus preventing the viral particle release (
