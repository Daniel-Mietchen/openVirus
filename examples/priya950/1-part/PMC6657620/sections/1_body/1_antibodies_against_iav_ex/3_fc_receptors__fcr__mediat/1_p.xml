<p>In addition to previously described mechanisms of protection for HA-Abs, indirect antiviral FcR-mediated effector functions like ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement mediated cell-cytotoxicity (CDCC) have been described both in humans and mice (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). Also, ADCC has been described for NA-Abs (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Although, these mechanisms of protection will not be addressed further in this article, these effector antiviral function of HA- and NA-Abs may have an important role on protection against IAV infection.
