<p>The immunogenicity of M2e was first reported in 1988 by Zebedee and Lamb. They described a mAb (14C2) that was produced in mice immunized with M2 protein plus adjuvant. This mAb recognized the ectodomain of the protein, and it was able to detect M2 on the virions, thus reducing viral growth. This was evidenced by the size reduction of lytic plaques when 14C2 was added to previously IAV-infected MDCK cells (
