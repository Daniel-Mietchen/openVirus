<p>Several reports in mice have shown that M2e can induce an efficient heterosubtypic protection. Different approaches have been used to determine this, such as coupling M2e to carrier proteins —like the hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) (

 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>), and others. Recently, the efficacy of Abs against HA (induced by TIV), against NA (recombinant N1 and N2) and against M2 (M2e5XVLP) was compared in mice. It was found that immune sera against NA and M2e were superior in terms of improving heterosubtypic protection and survival than anti-HA Abs induced by the split seasonal vaccine. Interestingly, the co-administration of NA and M2e5XVLP immune sera gave rise to a synergistic heterologous protection effect (
