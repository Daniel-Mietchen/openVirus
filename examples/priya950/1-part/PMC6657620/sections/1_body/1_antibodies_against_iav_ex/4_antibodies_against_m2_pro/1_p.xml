<p>Matrix protein 2 (M2) is the third most abundant protein on the IAV virion surface. It is a type III integral protein arranged as a homotetrameric channel linked by disulfide bonds, which function as proton selectors. They induce the acidification of the virions and consequently the dissociation of the vRNPs from matrix protein (M1) and their release into the cytoplasm during the entry phase of the IAV cycle. The M2 protein is 96 amino acids long, and it has three domains: a cytoplasmic C-terminal (54 aa), a transmembrane (19 aa), and a short and highly conserved N-terminal ectodomain (M2e, 23 aa). Antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine target M2, blocking the proton influx into the virion through an allosteric effect (
