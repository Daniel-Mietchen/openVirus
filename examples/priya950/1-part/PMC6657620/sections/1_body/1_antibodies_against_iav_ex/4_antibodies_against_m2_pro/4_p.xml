<p>Abs against M2 are not neutralizing. Nonetheless, due to the high expression of M2 on the surface of infected cells, they can contribute to the protection process by promoting effector functions based on their Fc region. Lee 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that anti-M2e Abs were not protective in Fc receptor common γ-chain deficient mice (FcRγ
 <sup>−/−</sup>) in comparison to the high protection observed among wild-type mice in passive transfer experiments (

In this context, El Bakkouuri et al. reported in a mouse model that protection induced by these Abs depended on phagocytosis of infected cells by alveolar macrophages (AM) by engagement to the Fc receptors (FcγRIII for IgG1, and FcγRI and/or FcγRIV for IgG2a) present in these cells (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). Furthermore, NK cells can induce ADCC by binding to the Fc domain of anti-M2 Abs. Simhadri et al. showed that freshly isolated and cytokine-preactivated NK cells in presence of a human anti-M2 antibody (1-10 mAb) can exert ADCC and secrete cytokines (

 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>), whereas Wang et al., reported that complement is necessary for an anti-M2e mAb to control lung viral titers in challenged mice (
