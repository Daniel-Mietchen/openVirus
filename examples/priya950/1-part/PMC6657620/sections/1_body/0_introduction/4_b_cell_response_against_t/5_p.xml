<p>During subsequent IAV infections, GC response from GC-derived memory B cells dominate the response, however, the role of the EF B cells cannot be discarded since it has been shown in an antigen-specific experimental mouse model that the GC-derived memory B cells pool can respond as EF in a secondary response (
