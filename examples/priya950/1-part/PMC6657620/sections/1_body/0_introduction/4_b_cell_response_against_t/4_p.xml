<p>On the other hand, some virus-specific B cells migrate toward the marginal zone of the B follicles, where they interact with CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells triggering a germinal center reaction (GCR) that leads, late during the infection, to the generation of long-lived plasma cells that maintain high levels of high-affinity Abs, which is the most desirable consequence of vaccination or infection, along with long-lived memory B cells (

Briefly, in the GCR, follicular helper T cells (Tfh), which express CD40L and cytokines like IL-4, IFN-γ, and TGF-β, induce immunoglobulin class switching of activated B cells. Moreover, Tfh and B cells physically interact via ICOS/ICOSL, PD-1/PD-L1, CD28/B7 and other co-stimulating signals, leading to IL-21 secretion. Jointly, these signals promote somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, resulting in influenza-specific high-affinity-ASCs. At the same time, during the GCR, some ASCs differentiate into memory B cells, which can be defined as cells that have undergone antigen-driven proliferation and have then become non-proliferating cells. They can be induced by re-exposure to the antigen and afterwards proliferate and secrete Abs. (
