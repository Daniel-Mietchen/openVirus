<p>The first Abs that participate in clearing an influenza infection are the so-called 
 <italic>natural Abs</italic>, which are polyreactive Abs, mainly IgM, secreted by CD5
 <sup>+</sup> B-1 cells present in pleural and peritoneal cavities. These Abs are continuously produced in the absence of infection, and they have low affinity for the antigens (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The role of natural Abs in the influenza infection was addressed by Baumgarth et al., who showed that the passive transfer of naïve serum from wild-type to IgM KO (
 <sup>−/−</sup>) mice infected with influenza reduced the mortality in comparison to the controls (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These Abs are present in airways in high levels, since they are transported to mucosal surfaces by poly-Ig-receptors located in the basolateral membrane of the alveolar epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). They could neutralize the IAV directly, or lyse cells by fixing complement (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, the levels of natural Abs are usually low, and most pathogens can overcome this barrier and establish an infection.
