<p>For an influenza-specific B-cell response to occur, the antigen must travel to secondary lymph organs (SLO) like draining lymph nodes and/or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT). There, specific B cells encounter the antigen for the first time; then, they are differentiated to antibody-secreting cells (ASC) (

Once in the LN or the spleen, the antigen may be captured, by two main types of cells; subcapsular sinus macrophages (SSM) and medullary dendritic cells (MDC), which capture the antigen mostly opsonized by complement components and thus, facilitate its encounter with the B cells. Then, the virus is transported and handed to the follicular dendritic cells (FDC), which retain it for continuous antigen presentation during long periods of time. These cells serve as major promotors of center germinal formation (
