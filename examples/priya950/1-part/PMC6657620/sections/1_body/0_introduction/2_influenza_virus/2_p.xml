<p>The IAV infects human epithelial cells in the respiratory tract by binding HA to the sialic acid residues present on their surface; this is followed by virus internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Upon endosome acidification, HA undergoes conformational changes that allow it to expose the fusion peptide that promotes viral-endosomal membrane fusion. On the other hand, the IAV core is also acidified by the entry of protons through the M2-ion channel. Both processes allow the vRNPs to be released into the cytoplasm, from where they are transported to the nucleus via nuclear localization signals (NLS) present in all vRNPs. Once in the nucleus, positive sense RNA is transcribed into mRNAs and replicated to produce a full-length complementary replicative intermediate (cRNA) by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Afterwards, the mRNAs exit the nucleus to be translated by ribosomes, and the cRNA will serve as template to produce viral RNA (vRNA). Newly synthesized viral proteins come back to nucleus to assemble vRNPs, which, assisted by the NEP protein, will be exported to the cytoplasm where they are now ready for the packaging process in the cell membrane. The budding process of the newly assembled virions is largely facilitated by the M1 protein that recruits the necessary viral and host cell components. Finally, the NA promotes the viral exit process by pruning the interactions between sialic acid and the newly formed virions (
