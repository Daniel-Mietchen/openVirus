<p>The Influenza A Virus (IAV) is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. The virion contains eight gene segments, encoding for at least 11 viral proteins. These gene segments are associated to the nucleoprotein (NP) and the polymerases (PB1, PB2, and PA), which form the ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. The vRNP complex is surrounded by matrix protein 1 (M1), which forms the core of the virion. This structure is covered by a lipidic membrane acquired from the host cell. This membrane contains the glycoproteins HA and neuraminidase (NA), which jointly represent over ninety percent of the protein present in the membrane. Furthermore, matrix protein 2 (M2) forms a homotetrameric structure that crosses the viral lipidic membrane and functions as a pH-dependent ion channel (
