<p>Other non-structural (NS) proteins are produced during the IAV infection cycle. They play major roles in modulating the immune system to facilitate the infection. NS1 inhibits type I interferons by binding directly to RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I) and/or impeding its ubiquitination by interacting with the E3 ligase TRIM25 (tripartite motif-containing protein 25) (
