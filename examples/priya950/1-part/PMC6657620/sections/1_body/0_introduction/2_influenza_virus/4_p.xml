<p>There are two major mechanisms of IAV evolution: 
 <italic>antigenic drift</italic> and 
 <italic>antigenic shift</italic>. The antigenic drift occurs frequently because of the poor fidelity of RNA polymerase that generates point mutations in the HA and the NA, that allow the virus to escape from neutralizing Abs. Eventually, these mutations are introduced into the circulating viral strains. This mechanism makes it necessary the annual revision of seasonal influenza vaccines. On the contrary, the antigenic shift occurs rarely, and consists in the generation of a completely new antigenic strain by the reassortment of gene segments during co-infections with human, avian and swine viruses. These evolutionary strategies are responsible for epidemics (antigenic drift) and pandemics (antigenic shift). The challenge posed by IAV is the generation of a “universal vaccine,” which could offer protection against any epidemic or pandemic strain (
