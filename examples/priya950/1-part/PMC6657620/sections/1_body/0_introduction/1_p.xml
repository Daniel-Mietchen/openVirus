<p>The influenza proteins are recognized as foreign by the immune system, and antibodies (Abs) against them are produced during vaccination or after a natural infection. The Ab response can be 
 <italic>neutralizing</italic> or 
 <italic>non-neutralizing</italic>. 
 <italic>Neutralization</italic> refers to the reduction of viral infectivity exerted by an Ab when binding to a virus. 
 <italic>Neutralizing Abs</italic> inhibit virion cell entry because their epitopes are located near the receptor-binding site (RBS) on the globular head of HA. They can also interfere with the conformational changes necessary to expose the fusion peptide on HA (anti-stalk Abs). Despite the fact that neutralizing Abs are protective, the term neutralization has been often misused as a synonym of protection. Actually, these terms point to very different processes: whereas neutralizing Abs are defined by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (e.g., hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays), the term protection is associated to the reduction of morbidity and mortality 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this context, a minor fraction of 
 <italic>non-neutralizing Abs</italic> that are generated upon the recognition of other viral epitopes can also be protective by other mechanisms, such as those that do not involve interfering the virus-cellular receptor interaction like increasing phagocytosis, activating complement or promoting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (
