<p>Viruses are not always pathogens, and they are also an important and inseparable part of the biosphere and should be studied as such. Unfortunately, the wider functional and evolutionary role of viruses in the biosphere is not yet widely accepted in most disciplines, a good exception being marine biology/ecology, where viruses are already accepted as important players. How the virosphere is related to the rest of the biosphere can be examined in several different ways. One of these ways is a protein domain-based view. We analysed how virosphere protein domain occurrence is related to the occurrence of protein domains in all (sequenced) organisms (we called the last the phylogenomic space of protein domains). This is based on the distribution of protein domains in viruses and in organisms (by superkingdom), i.e., which protein domains are found in viruses (or a specific set of viruses) and to what extent and where these domains are found elsewhere in organisms. In our analysis, we used predefined protein domain databases Pfam, Superfamily and Gene3D. Domains found in the virosphere can be found in a different number of organisms, starting from a few organisms for some viral domains up to all organisms in the others. However, if we specify a narrower set of viruses (Baltimore class, viral family or host range), differences between viral taxons appear. Therefore, the heterogeneity of viruses is also very clearly expressed by where in the phylogenomic space the domains that are found in different viral taxons are located. A few examples are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00420-f006">Figure 6</xref>. An important conclusion from our analysis is the existence of virosphere-specific protein domains (domains not found in cellular organisms), even at the level of structural homology. Several evolutionary routes that may lead to virosphere specificity (absence in cellular organisms) will be discussed. Considering the new knowledge on virus-to-host gene transfers in eukaryotes during the last ten years, it is clear that the virosphere is a source of functional and structural novelties also for this superkingdom. A possible route for the genesis of novel domains in viruses (as well as in organisms) is double coding or overprinted genes. We have developed a web-tool cRegions (
 <uri xlink:href="http://bioinfo.ut.ee/cRegions/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://bioinfo.ut.ee/cRegions/</uri>), which helps to find potential double coding regions (and other embedded functional elements) in coding sequences [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Of course, there exist many domains that are shared by viruses and organisms. Beside others, virus-to-host gene transfer is one process leading to shared domains. A number of examples for this kind of transfer have been described; however, they are all based on sequence-to-sequence comparison. Taking into account the very fast evolution of viruses, the sequence similarity may fall below the confidential detection limit relatively fast. We applied structure-guided information to detect more ancestral virus-to-host transfers. Our data show that “as a proof of principle”, using protein structure-guided HMM models, it is possible to detect V2Htransfers not “visible”; with BLAST analysis.
