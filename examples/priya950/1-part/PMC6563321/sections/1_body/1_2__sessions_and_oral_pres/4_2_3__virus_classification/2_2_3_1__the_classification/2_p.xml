<p>Peter Simmonds described their investigations of the extent to which the existing virus taxonomy could be reproduced by the recoverable genetic relationships between sequences of viruses currently classified by the ICTV. Comparisons of viruses were based on extraction of protein coding gene signatures and genome organisational features from virus sequences and using these to construct a metric of genetic relatedness through computation of Composite Generalised Jaccard (CGJ) distances between each pair of viruses [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. For eukaryotic viruses, there was large-scale consistency between such genetic relationships and their current family- and genus-level taxonomic assignments, irrespective of genome configurations and genome sizes. The analysis pipeline, “Genome Relationships Applied to Virus Taxonomy” (GRAViTy), diagrammatically summarised in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00420-f004">Figure 4</xref>, predicted family membership of eukaryotic viruses with close to 100% accuracy and specificity; this method should therefore enable the vast collection of metagenomic sequences to be classified in a manner consistent with the current ICTV taxonomy. Preliminary analysis of such datasets revealed that over one half (460/921) of (near)-complete genome sequences from recently-generated eukaryotic virus datasets could be assigned to 127 novel family-level groupings, more than double the number of eukaryotic virus families in the ICTV taxonomy.
