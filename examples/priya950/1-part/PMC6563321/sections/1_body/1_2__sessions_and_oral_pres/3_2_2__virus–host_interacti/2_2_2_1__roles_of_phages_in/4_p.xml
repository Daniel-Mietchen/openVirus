<p>Martha Clokieâ€™s group is currently in the process of creating and examining genetic mutants to identify phenotypes and conducting structural work on novel proteins, for example to identify tail fibres. However, this work is time consuming and technically demanding. Choosing which genes to focus on is key, as downstream work is key to unravelling critical phenotypes. Martha Clokie presented data on the efficacy of this phage set to treat disease along with a framework for their ongoing work to use different machine learning approaches to examine the genomes of these phages and their associated bacteria robustly in order to identify hard-to-identify features, for example shared and unique genes of interest. These approaches will direct work to unravel the mechanics of phage efficacy for virulent phages and modes of action for lysogens.</p>
