<p>Avian Influenza A Viruses (AIVs) circulate among wild and domestic bird populations worldwide. While some strains only cause mild to asymptomatic infections, known as Low Pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LP), High Pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HP) can have an extremely high mortality rate in both domestic and wild bird populations, leading to huge economic loses (

Although virulence is a polygenic trait, molecular determinants of virulence have been well characterised for AIVs, such as a polybasic proteolytic cleavage site within the hemagglutinin protein, which enables a systemic viral spread within the host [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. We hypothesise that the parallel evolution of HP lineages from LP ancestors may have been facilitated by permissive or compensatory secondary mutations occurring anywhere in the viral genome, preceding or following the appearance of a polybasic proteolytic cleavage site. We used a comparative phylogenetic and structural approach to detect shared mutations evolving under positive selection across the whole genome of HP AIVs of the H7NX and H5NX subtypes and developed a model that statistically assesses genotype-phenotype associations. We present cumulative evolutionary and structural evidence that supports the association between parallel mutations and the evolution of the HP phenotype. Parallel mutations occur frequently among HP lineages of the same viral subtype (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00420-f008">Figure 8</xref>B). Many of the mutations have been previously determined to increase viral fitness in terms of their biological properties, whilst most of these are ranked as stabilising to protein structure, supporting that these are rather permissive/compensatory. The mutational panel provided here may function as an early detection system for transitional virulence stages. Circulating AIVs that do not have a polybasic cleavage site yet, but show all or some of the amino acid changes ranked, should remain under surveillance.
