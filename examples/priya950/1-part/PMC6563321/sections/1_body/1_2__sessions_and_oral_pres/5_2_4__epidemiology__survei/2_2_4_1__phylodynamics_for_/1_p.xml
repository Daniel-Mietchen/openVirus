<p>Infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens in animal and livestock populations can have important economic and health consequences globally. The ability to foresee where, in which host species and under what conditions outbreaks could occur is key to developing prevention and control strategies. Sequencing pathogens from infected animals has become much more affordable and widespread in recent years, especially during outbreaks and in endemic disease settings with targeted surveillance programmes. Consequently, there are growing collections of animal virus sequences from around the globe. In this talk, the use of viral sequence data together with phylodynamic methodologies for understanding the transmission patterns in animal populations was discussed, using Avian Influenza (AI), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) as examples [
