<p>This session was chaired by Philippe Le Mercier (University of Geneva Medical School, Switzerland), board member of the EVBC. Two speakers have been invited on this topic. Volker Thiel (University of Bern, Switzerland), board member of the EVBC, presented about host proteins composing the microenvironment of coronavirus replicase complexes. EVBC member Stefanie Deinhardt-Emmer (Jena University Hospital, Germany) presented about co-infection between 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and influenza virus. From the submitted abstracts, we selected talks by Jenna Nicole Kelly (University of Bern, Switzerland) on single-cell analysis of influenza virus infection, Florian Erhard (University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany) on tools revealing core features of CMV-induced regulation in single cells and Daniel Blanco Melo (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA) on in-depth transcriptomic analysis in influenza A virus infection. Studying virus infections at the molecular level is as complex as studying the host systems they infect.
