   <bold>A</bold>) Geographical occurrence of historic Highly-Pathogenic (HP) outbreaks for the H7NX viruses. Countries of emergence are highlighted in red. Year of circulation, virus subtype and consensus sequence for the polybasic Cleavage Site (pCS) within the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein are indicated for the selected outbreaks used in this work (C1-C9). Each outbreak corresponds to a distinct genotype, defined as well- supported clusters within all viral genome segment trees (data not shown). (
   <bold>B</bold>) MCCtree for the HA protein with reconstruction of ancestral states for site 143, as mutation A143T was found to be evolving under parallel evolution and to be associated with the HP phenotype, occurring in 4/9 of the HP clusters analysed. This mutation is a non-conservative amino acid change located within an antigenic pocket site. Branches within the trees are coloured according to the corresponding amino acid states in nodes (tip states not shown). Ancestral nodes preceding the emergence of a mutation associated with the HP lineages are represented with coloured circles. The probabilities of a given amino acid state occurring within ancestral/descending nodes are indicated. The HP clusters of interest are highlighted with blue circles. Mutations strongly associated with an HP phenotype may function as an early detection system for transitional virulence stages.
