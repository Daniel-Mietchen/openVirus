  <title>Background</title>
  <p>Viral load testing is key to monitoring response to anti-retroviral therapy (ART). However, in lower and middle income countries with large epidemics, pre-analytical challenges threaten the quality of testing. It is unknown how much delayed processing and adverse storage affects the validity of results. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of delayed testing and warmer storage conditions on HIV RNA stability in diagnostic samples.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>1194 samples, collected in EDTA or plasma preparation (PPT) tubes, were studied. Immediately after initial testing, primary tubes were stored for 72, 96 or 168 hours at 4°C, 20°C or 30°C. The viral load was then repeated and the 2 results were compared.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Viral loads were very stable, with &lt;0.5 log copies/ml median difference noted between paired tests for all storage times and temperatures. The viral load in samples stored for up to a week reliably differentiated between ART-suppressed and failing patients in 98.83% of instances. However, re-centrifugation immediately prior to repeat testing was essential to avoid falsely elevated readings, probably due to contamination of plasma with cell-associated viral nucleic acids. Approximately 20% of samples with initially undetectable viral loads were weakly positive (&lt;100 copies/mL) on repeat. This was not exacerbated by duration or temperature of storage.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>Viral RNA in diagnostic samples is stable well beyond currently recommended limits. However, when testing stored primary samples, contamination of plasma with cellular material easily occurs. Low viral loads (&lt;100copies/mL) in samples stored in this way should be interpreted with caution.</p>
