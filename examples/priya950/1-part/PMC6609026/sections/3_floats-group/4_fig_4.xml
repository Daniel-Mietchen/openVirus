  <p>Omitting centrifugation immediately prior to repeat testing is associated with a higher viral load in the second test: In (a), the log value for each sample in test 1 (X-axis) is plotted against the log value in test 2 (Y-axis). Line indicates an ideal regression line, r
   <sup>2</sup> = 1. In (b) the repeat results of samples that were undetectable (LDL) in test 1 are graphed according to the following categories: undetectable or &lt;20 copies/mL, 20–100 copies/mL, 101–500 copies/mL, 501–1000 copies/mL or &gt;1000 copies/mL.
