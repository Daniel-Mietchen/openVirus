<p>The stability of samples that were RNA negative at test one was also tested. 441 samples (195 PPT and 246 EDTA) had undetectable RNA at test one. On retesting after storage, the VL in 79.1% of samples remained undetectable or &lt;20 copies/mL. In the 20.9% of samples that had a detectable value on the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> test, RNA levels were mostly low. Overall, in 14.7% of samples the second viral load was &lt;100 copies/mL, in 5.7% it was 101â€“500 copies/mL and in 0.4% &gt; 500 copies/mL. Though no statistical test was used to confirm this, the proportion of samples that had a detectable viral load on 2
 <sup>nd</sup> test did not appear to be affected by storage time, temperature or type of collection tube.
