<p>When repeat centrifugation was omitted just prior to the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> test, the RNA level in test 2 increased substantially in some samples. (

 </bold> This was observed in both EDTA and PPT samples and was evident by 48 hours after (prior) centrifugation. The VL remained within 0.5 log copies/mL in test 2 in only 41 of the 83 (49%) samples tested in this experiment. Of note 29 of 57 samples with initially undetectable HIV RNA had detectable RNA in the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> test: 10 (17.5%) were &lt; 100 copies/ml, 12 (21%) were 101–500 copies/ml, 1 (1.8%) was 501–1000 copies/ml and 6 (10.5%) were &gt;1000 copies/ml. (

 </bold>) Overall, the median increase was 0.63 log copies/mL (range 0.00–4.13) in test 2.
