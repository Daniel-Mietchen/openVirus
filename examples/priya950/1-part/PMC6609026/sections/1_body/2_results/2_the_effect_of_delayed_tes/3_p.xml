<p>WHO guidelines for management of patients on ART advise a level of &gt;1000 copies/mL as the threshold indicative of treatment failure [

Thus the study results were analysed according to whether the difference between tests 1 and 2 was great enough to result in misclassification of a patient’s status (failure vs suppression). Of 1194 samples tested, a potential misclassification may have occurred in 14 (8 EDTA and 6 PPT) instances, or 1.17% samples. The discordant results are listed in supplemental digital content,

 </bold> In 10 the initial VL (range 1–890 copies/ml) increased to between 1000–70086 copies/mL and in 4 samples the level (range 1674–2940 copies/ml) decreased on repeat to between 500–846 copies/mL.
