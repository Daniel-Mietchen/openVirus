 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219381.g002">Fig 2</xref> illustrates changes in log VL at each storage temperature and time point. For samples stored at 4°C, a median VL decrease was consistent for both sample types (EDTA and PPT) and over time, but the net effect was small, with all the interquartile ranges well within 0.5 log copies/ml compared to the initial VL results. At 20°C the trend was less apparent with some testing intervals resulting in slight increase, while others remained similar to original testing. Once again the VL changes were not significant, as none of the interquartile ranges cross the 0.5log difference line. In samples stored at 30°C, median values were mostly higher than baseline values. (Median log copies/ml differences for each sample category are given in supplementary digital content,
