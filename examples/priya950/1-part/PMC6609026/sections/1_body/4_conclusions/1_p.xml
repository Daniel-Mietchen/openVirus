<p>Despite the limitations that could increase the variance in VL between test 1 and 2, viral RNA in samples stored in primary tubes is remarkably stable under sub-optimal storage conditions. Samples stored for up to a week reliably differentiated between ART-suppressed and failing patients in 98.83% of instances. The impact of the delay on EDTA and PPT tubes were largely equivalent, although there was slightly more variability with EDTA samples. Re-centrifugation prior to repeat testing is very important to minimise inadvertent detection of cell associated viral nucleic acids which falsely elevates the viral load in some samples. Low RNA levels (&lt;2 log copies/mL) in sub-optimally stored samples should be interpreted with caution as this could be due to cell-associated viral nucleic acids rather than true treatment failure.</p>
