<p>Two types of sample tubes are used in South Africa, namely standard ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) and plasma preparation (PPT) tubes. Use of the latter was introduced to improve RNA stability in samples where manufacturer timelines are not achievable and were locally validated [
 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. PPT tubes contain an inert gel and spray-dried EDTA. During centrifugation, the gel migrates and forms a barrier between the plasma and cellular elements. However, there have been concerns that measurements in PPT tubes may be affected by pre-analytical processing [

 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In particular, there are reports that RNA levels may be higher than in standard EDTA tubes [
 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also, adequate separation of cellular elements may not always occur and this can result in falsely elevated viral load readings if testing is delayed [
 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For this reason it is routine practice to re-centrifuge samples just prior to viral load testing, at public sector laboratories in South Africa.
