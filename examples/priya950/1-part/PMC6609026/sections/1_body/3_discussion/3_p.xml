<p>Viral RNA appeared to decay in samples stored at 4°C, less so at room temperature and actually increased at 30°C, though not significantly. This suggests that the VL is impacted by a number of opposing factors and the measured result is the sum of these. Two identifiable factors are RNA decay of free plasma virus and release of intra-cellular viral nucleic acids. If these factors are indeed the dominant processes, it follows that storage at 4°C slows down release of intracellular RNA (or virus) from cells. Hence, the dominant trend at this temperature is due to decay of free virus. However, it must be noted that the median change was small, only -0.24 log copies/mL after 168 hours for EDTA and -0.13 log copies/mL for PPT samples. At room temperature, both processes partially cancel each other out, hence the net effect is an even smaller difference. At 30°C, the dominant effect appears to be viral RNA release into the plasma. However, even at this temperature, the change was within acceptable limits. In 1.17% of instances (14 samples) the difference between tests 1 and 2 were sufficient to result in a change in the patient’s status, based on WHO guidelines [

 <sup>nd</sup> viral load was higher. Variability was consistently less in samples collected in PPT tubes. This is likely to be due to lower (but not negligible) exposure to cellular elements in PPT tubes during extended storage.
