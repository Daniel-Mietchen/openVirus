<p>Due to the design of the study, where routine diagnostic samples were used, direct assessment of viral decay using the same set of patient samples in the different experiments was not possible. Also only laboratory conditions were tested. Further field studies are required to confirm our findings. Despite this, we believe the relatively large sample size in this study contributes substantially to the existing data around VL stability. Samples were selected on the basis of having sufficient plasma for a second test and this could be a source of bias, however, this is likely to be random and should not result in significant over or under estimation of VL decay. As we selected more samples with detectable VL, in the interest of having sufficient power to analyse VL decay, the impact of the VL delay could be overestimated. Finally, because we performed a second VL with limited plasma in the primary tube, the study design could have increased the chances of detecting cell associated viral nucleic acids in the second test.</p>
