<p>Patients on ARVs have variable amounts of intra-cellular viral RNA and DNA (both are detectable with viral load assays if cellular material is aspirated during testing) [
 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While HIV RNA decay in plasma is rapid after initiation of effective ART, decay of intracellular proviral and episomal DNA is slower and ongoing viral mRNA continues to be synthesised despite therapy [
 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; [
 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus viral nucleic acids continue to be detectable in cellular compartments long after initiation of ART. While most samples that were undetectable at test 1 remained undetectable at test 2, 20.9% of samples had a low level of RNA detectable on test 2 (with a VL mostly &lt;2log copies/mL). The proportion of samples that became positive was similar in all delayed testing groups which suggests that delay in testing was not the main cause of this phenomenon. The finding can partly be explained by the recognised variability in VL detection when RNA levels are close to the limit of detection of the assay. But it could also be due to inadvertent aspiration of cellular elements, including platelets. Indeed, the study design could have increased the chances of detecting cell associated viral nucleic acids in the second test. Due to a lower volume of plasma available for the repeat test, the risk of aspirating cellular material would have been greater. However, as low volume samples are a frequent occurrence in our setting, it is important to recognise this potential problem. Thus low levels of viral RNA detected in samples stored and tested in this way should be interpreted with caution. In a study which followed up patients with repeated low level viraemia, levels &gt; 200 copies/mL were associated with an increased chance of future virological failure [
 <xref rid="pone.0219381.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, this was not the case for patients with “blips” or levels &lt;200 copies/mL. The risk of failure in the next 18 months was the same as that of patients with consistently undetectable viral loads during clinical follow up. Thus levels below this cut off are unlikely to be clinically significant and require no clinical action. They may well reflect inadvertent detection of cell associated viral nucleic acids during testing.
