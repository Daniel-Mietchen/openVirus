<p>A major factor that impacted on reproducibility was omitting the repeat centrifugation step just before the second test. This affected a significant proportion of samples in both PPT and EDTA tubes in this separate experiment. The repeat VL reading could be higher by up to 4.13 log copies/mL. This suggests that cellular elements containing viral nucleic acids, or inadequately removed platelets with trapped HIV particles, diffused into the liquid phase during storage and were aspirated during the second test. Re-centrifugation immediately prior to testing was largely effective at preventing this. In PPT tubes the gel should prevent aspiration of cellular elements during testing. However, inspection of these tubes often revealed small amounts of cellular material at the gel-fluid interface, indicating that effective separation of plasma from cellular elements does not always occur completely. This phenomenon has been described [
