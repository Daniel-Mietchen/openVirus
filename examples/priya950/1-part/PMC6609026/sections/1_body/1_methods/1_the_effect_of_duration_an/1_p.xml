<p>Routine diagnostic specimens collected from patients on ART as part of the South African national antiretroviral programme in and around Cape Town were studied. Samples were processed according to the local standard operating procedure, briefly outlined as follows: On arrival at the laboratory, patient and sample information, including date and time of collection are captured on the laboratory information system and samples are centrifuged for 10 minutes at relative centrifugal force (RCF) 3,273g. They are then transferred to the bench where HIV VL testing on primary tube EDTA or PPT samples is performed on the Roche Cobas AmpliPrep, Cobas TaqMan (CAP/CTM) version 2.0 assay. Using a 1 mL input, this assay has a dynamic range from 20 to 10 000 000 copies/mL (1.3â€“7 log
 <sub>10</sub>). The delay between sample collection and initial VL testing is recorded as time to test 1. The result of test 1 was reported as the final result for the purpose of patient management. Thereafter, the samples were de-identified and assigned a separate study number. Further testing was not part of routine laboratory process.
