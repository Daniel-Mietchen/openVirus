<p>Data were analysed using Stata Version 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA). For analysis, samples with an undetectable VL (LDL, or lower than detectable limits) on test 1 or test 2, were assigned a value of 1 copy/mL. Samples with a detectable VL, but less than 20 copies/mL, were assigned a value of 19 copies/mL. Samples with a VL &gt;20 copies/mL were assigned the value reported by the analyser. The impact of delayed testing, storage temperature and repeat centrifugation were assessed in three separate analyses. First, the VL change among samples with a detectable test 1 VL (&gt;20 copies/ml) were assessed. The proportion of instances where the test 2 VL was within 0.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL of test 1 for each storage temperature and time category was determined. This cut off was selected because in clinical practice, only VL changes &gt;0.5log copies per ml are considered clinically significant [

The primary stability estimate was the median change in VL after the 72, 96 and 168 hour intervals and variability in this change was expressed in interquartile ranges. In addition, the proportion of instances where the test 2 VL result was within 0.5 log10 copies/mL of test 1 for each storage temperature and time category was determined. Results of samples collected in PPT tubes and EDTA tubes were analysed separately. Second, samples with undetectable RNA in test 1 were assessed to determine reproducibility of measurement. Finally, repeat VL measurements in an additional set of samples that was not re-centrifuged prior to retest was analysed separately.
