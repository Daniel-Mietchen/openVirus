<p id="Par33">Based on our results, we strongly recommend that a robust and strengthened vector surveillance program be maintained on Madeira Island. There is an urgent need for new control strategies since the local 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations are considered resistant to several insecticide classes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and this could lead to the complete failure of the vector control programmes. Our results with CHIKV and DENV suggest that it is crucial for Madeira Island to be prepared for more mosquito-borne disease epidemics. If mosquito densities reach levels like those observed during the dengue outbreak in 2012, immediate control measures, such as intensive community-based campaigns or using alternative non-chemical strategies, should be triggered to prevent arbovirus transmission. Our results are also of great importance for European countries where another species, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, has been implicated in the last chikungunya and dengue outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Coordination of vector control strategies between all European countries should be implemented as globalisation will contribute to the growing expansion of vector-borne pathogens, mosquito vectors and viremic people.
