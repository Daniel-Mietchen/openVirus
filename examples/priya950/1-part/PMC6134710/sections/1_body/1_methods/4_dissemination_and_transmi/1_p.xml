<p id="Par20">Twenty mosquitoes from each population were analysed at different time-points: 3, 6, 9 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) for CHIKV and 7 and 14 dpi for DENV-2. To estimate the infection and dissemination, the virus in bodies (including thorax and abdomen) and heads was analysed, respectively. Mosquito samples were grounded in 300 μl of Leibovitz L15 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000×

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Briefly, legs and wings were removed from each mosquito, and the proboscis was inserted into a 20 μl tip containing 5 μl of FBS. After 20 min, saliva containing FBS was expelled into 45 μl of Leibovitz L15 medium for titration. Infection rate (IR) was used as a measure of susceptibility to each virus and corresponds to the number of mosquitoes with the infected body among the tested ones. The percentage of mosquitoes with infected heads among mosquitoes with an infected body is the dissemination rate (DR). The transmission rate (TR) is defined as the percentage of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among mosquitoes with positive viral dissemination. The number of viral particles per saliva and head was determined by titration using focus fluorescent assay on C6/36 cells. Briefly, 10-fold serial dilutions were performed for each sample and inoculated onto C6/36 cell culture in 96-well plates. After incubation at 28 °C during three days (CHIKV) or 5 days (DENV), plates were stained using hyper-immune ascetic fluid specific to CHIKV or DENV as the primary antibody. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the second antibody (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA).
