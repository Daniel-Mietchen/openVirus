<p id="Par16">The recent emergence of dengue and chikungunya in Europe, such as the 2012 outbreaks of dengue in Madeira and chikungunya in France [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and Italy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], have raised concerns of arbovirus transmission in countries infested by mosquito species that could sustain epidemics, especially 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and/or 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (Skuse, 1894) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Due to the intense social and commercial relations with Brazil and Venezuela, Madeira Island could serve as a source for the introduction of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and/or arboviruses to continental Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The risk of arboviral outbreaks in Madeira is real since imported cases of DENV and Zika virus (ZIKV) were detected in citizens returning from DENV- and ZIKV-infected countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and local 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations from Madeira were experimentally susceptible to ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This study aims to assess the ability of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations from Madeira Island to experimentally transmit CHIKV and DENV. The results obtained will provide a solid basis for decisions regarding disease prevention and control for the Madeira Health Authorities and decision-makers in Europe.
