<p id="Par32">The temperate climate on Madeira Island can also play a key role in modulating 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> vector competence for arbovirus transmission. It has been shown that temperature affects the vector competence in a tripartite interaction between mosquito genotype, viral genotype, and environment [
