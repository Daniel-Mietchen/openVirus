<p id="Par30">CHIKV and DENV are two arboviruses with the highest potential to be introduced to Madeira Island. Based on genetic markers (mtDNA and 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutations), it has been shown that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Madeira originated from Brazil or Venezuela [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Owing to the extensive exchanges of goods and people with the two South American countries, the risk of CHIKV autochthonous cases on Madeira Island remains high. As previously stated, the Asian genotype of CHIKV was used for the oral infections in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Madeira. CHIKV has had a severe impact in the Americas since 2014, particularly in Venezuela with the highest number of cases recorded in the Andean region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As with CHIKV, all DENV serotypes can be introduced to Madeira by a viremic traveller returning to Funchal from Caracas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Caracas is connected to the island by weekly direct flights [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].
