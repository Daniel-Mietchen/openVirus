  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">
   <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes mainly transmit the arboviruses dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in urban areas, causing a severe public health problem. In 2012–2013, a major dengue outbreak occurred on Madeira Island where the mosquito 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was the only vector. Up to now, the competence of 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations from Madeira to transmit DENV or CHIKV remains unknown. This study aimed to assess experimentally the ability of 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations from Madeira to transmit these viruses.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par2">By orally exposing mosquitoes to CHIKV (NC/2011-568) and DENV-2 (Bangkok), the vector competence of two field-collected 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations, i.e. Funchal and Paúl do Mar, was evaluated. We found that both populations were similarly infected and ensured the dissemination and transmission of CHIKV at the same rates. With DENV-2, viral dissemination was significantly higher in the Funchal population compared to Paúl do Mar. We found no significant differences in transmission rates between populations.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par3">To our knowledge, this study has demonstrated for the first time the ability of temperate European 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations from Madeira to transmit DENV and CHIKV. As our results suggest, there is a potential risk for the local transmission of DENV and CHIKV if introduced to Madeira or continental Europe where 
   <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is present. Our results highlight the need for continuing vector surveillance and control on Madeira Island to future-proof the Island against mosquito-borne epidemics.
