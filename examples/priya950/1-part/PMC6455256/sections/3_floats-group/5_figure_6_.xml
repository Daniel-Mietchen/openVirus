  <p>Effects of itraconazole and posaconazole on IAV infectivity under acidic bypass conditions. Cells were pretreated with either the solvent DMSO, posaconazole (Posa) or itraconazole (Itra) for 16 h, and were infected with IAV (PR8M, 20 MOI, 8 h) in the presence of Bafilomycin A1 under acidic bypass conditions. Non-infected cells and infection without acidic bypass in the presence of Bafilomycin A1 served as controls. NP-positive cells were detected by FACS (5,000 cells per sample). Data obtained in (A) A549 cells and (B) Vero cells are expressed as the median percentages ± SEM
