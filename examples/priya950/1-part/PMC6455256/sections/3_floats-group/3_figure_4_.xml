  <p>Itraconazole and posaconazole impair an early step in the IAV infection cycle. Cells pretreated with either the solvent DMSO, posaconazole (Posa), or itraconazole (Itra) for 16 h were infected with PR8M at the indicated MOI for 4 h. Bafilomycin A1 (Baf) served as a negative control. Nuclei were stained with DAPI, and infected cells were detected by nuclear vNP staining. Scale bar, 20 µm. To assess the percentages of successfully infected cells, the numbers of NP-positive nuclei were automatically quantified. Representative images are shown, and bar graphs represent the respective mean percentages ± SEM of NP-positive nuclei of &gt;1000 infected cells. (A) A549 cells, three independent experiments, (B) Vero cells, Data represent means ± SEM
