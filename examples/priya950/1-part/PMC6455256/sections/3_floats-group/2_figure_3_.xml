  <p>Itraconazole and posaconazole prime the IFN response. (A) PR8M and PAN virus titers upon posaconazole (Posa) and itraconazole (Itra) treatment of IFN-insensitive Vero cells. (B, C) qPCR analysis of the IFNs 
   <italic>IFNα</italic> and 
   <italic>IFNβ</italic> and the ISGs 
   <italic>IFITM3</italic> and 
   <italic>MX1</italic> in non-infected and (C) PR8M-infected A549 cells after 16 h treatment with either DMSO, itraconazole (Itra) or posaconazole (Posa). Samples were obtained from at least seven independent experiments and were run in triplicates. Expression levels of the genes of interest in the individual samples were normalized to GAPDH and ACTB. 2
   <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> was used to calculate the fold change of relative gene expression compared to control. Graphs show drug-induced fold difference in the respective genes relative to control in the individual samples, with the mean fold change superimposed. Note that in (B), all samples were uninfected, whereas in (C), all samples were IAV-infected. Statistical significance of the differences was evaluated by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests on ΔΔCt values. ****
