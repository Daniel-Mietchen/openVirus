<p>The human influenza virus strains A/Puerto-Rico/8/34 Münster (H1N1) (PR8M), seasonal A/Pan/99 (H3N2) (PAN), A/seal/Mass/1-SC35M/1980 (H7N7) (SC35M), B/Lee/1940 (Lee), and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) strain were from the virus strain collection of the Institute of Virology, University of Münster, Germany. All virus strains were passaged and titered on MDCK cells. For infection, cells were washed with PBS and were infected at the indicated multiplicities of infection (MOI) of virus diluted in infection-PBS (PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.9 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) at 37°C (33°C for IBV) for 30 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with infection-DMEM (DMEM containing 0.2% BSA, 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.9 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) for the indicated periods of time.
