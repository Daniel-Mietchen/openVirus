<p>Lungs of four animals per condition were homogenized in TriZol using lysing matrix tubes (MD Biomedicals). Total RNA was isolated and 1 µg was converted into cDNA using the High-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit and random hexamer primers (Applied Biosystems). Antiviral gene expression in the lung was analysed by murine Taqman primer/probe sets (Universal ProbeLibrary, Roche) on a LightCycler
 <sup>®</sup> 480 Instrument II (Roche).
