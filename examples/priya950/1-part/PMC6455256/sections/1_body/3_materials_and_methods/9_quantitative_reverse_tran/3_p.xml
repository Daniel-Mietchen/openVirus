<p>For all qPCR setups, samples from independent experiments were run in triplicates. For statistical analysis, the delta-delta-Ct method was used. In brief, Ct values for genes of interest in the individual samples were normalized to the housekeeping 
 <italic>genes GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase)</italic> and 
 <italic>ACTB (beta-Actin)</italic> or, in the case of lung homogenates, 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> and 
 <italic>CYCS</italic> (
 <italic>Cytochrome c</italic>), resulting in ΔCt values. Mean ΔCt of the control samples was calculated, and ΔΔCt values of all individual samples were calculated as difference between the ΔCt value of the individual sample and the mean control ΔCt. 2
 <sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> was used to calculate the relative fold gene expression levels. One-way ANOVA on ΔΔCt values was used to analyse the statistical significance of the differences.
