<p>WT C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Envigo (The Netherlands) and housed at the barrier-free and specific pathogen-free facility at the Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation (ZMBE) at the University of Muenster. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines for the welfare of experimental animals issued by the Federal Government of Germany and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and were approved by an external committee (LANUV, 84-02.04.2016.A426). Eight-to-ten weeks-old male animals were treated intragastrically with itraconazole (70 mg/kg body weight) diluted in propylene glycol hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrine. Human equivalent dose (HED) was calculated using the equation HED mg/kg = mouse dose mg/kg ×

Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane prior to intranasal infection with 500 pfu (plaque forming units) of the IAV strain PR8M. To assess pain and distress during the course of infection, animals were assessed based on a scoring system with sufficiently frequent observation times that assigns numerical values to several criteria of animal conditions that were considered signs of morbidity or moribundity, including changes in body temperature, physical appearance, behaviour, and weight loss. Animals that reached the cumulative threshold score were euthanized. A body weight loss of &gt;20 percent compared to start of the treatment was the cut-off parameter for euthanasia, regardless of the total score. From a total of 40 infected mice (20 itraconazole-treated, 20 vehicle-treated), 18 mice had to be euthanized because body weight loss was more than 20%. The date of death for euthanized mice was marked as the date of euthanasia. None of the animals was found dead during the course of the experiment.
