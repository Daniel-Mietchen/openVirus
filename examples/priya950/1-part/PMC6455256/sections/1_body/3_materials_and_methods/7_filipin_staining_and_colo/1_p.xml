<p>Cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, subsequently washed twice with PBS, and blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 60 min. To visualize free cellular cholesterol, cells were stained with filipin (complex from 
 <italic>Streptomyces filipinensis</italic>, 1.25 mg/ml) for 2 h. Late endosomal/lysosomal compartments were identified by staining the endolysosomal marker protein CD63 with a TRITC-coupled anti-CD63 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech; 1:50 in 2% BSA in PBS) for 90 min. Cell nuclei were labelled with DRAQ5 (1:1000 in 2% BSA in PBS) for 30 min. Confocal microscopy was performed with an LSM 780 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 oil immersion objective. The colocalization of filipin and CD63-TRITC signals were quantified with the JACoP plugin [
