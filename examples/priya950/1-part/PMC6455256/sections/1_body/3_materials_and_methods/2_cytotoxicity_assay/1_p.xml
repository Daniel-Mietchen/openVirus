<p>A549 cells were untreated or treated at the indicated concentrations with the solvent DMSO, itraconazole, and posaconazole. Because of the strong cytotoxic effects, staurosporine (1 µM) served as a positive control. Upon 24 h of treatment, MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was added to the cells for 4 h. The supernatant was aspirated and DMSO was added for 5 min, and subsequently, the OD
 <sub>562</sub> was measured.
