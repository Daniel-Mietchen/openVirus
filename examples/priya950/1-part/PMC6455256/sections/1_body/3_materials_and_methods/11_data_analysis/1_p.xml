<p>A priori power analysis (G*Power 3.1, Faul et al., 2007) was used to estimate the required sample sizes. Data were analysed with Prism 6.00 (GraphPad). For dose–response curves, virus titers were normalized to percentages of the titers detected in control cells, and drug concentrations were log-transformed. IC values were calculated from the sigmoidal curve fits. For statistical analysis, significant differences were evaluated using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. 
 <italic>In-vivo</italic> experiments were analysed by Mantel-Cox log-rank test or Mann–Whitney
