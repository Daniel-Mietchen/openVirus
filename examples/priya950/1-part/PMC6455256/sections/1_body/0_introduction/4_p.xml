<p>Because our previous work indicated a crucial role for endosomal cholesterol balance in the release and infectivity of IAV progeny, we investigated the antiviral capability of two well-studied, systemic triazole derivate drugs itraconazole and posaconazole [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These drugs display antifungal activity due to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, particularly the lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase, which is essential for the ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi, thus inhibiting fungal growth and membrane function [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In mammalian cells, however, its inhibition impairs homeostasis and 
 <italic>de-novo</italic> synthesis of cholesterol [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, both anti-fungal compounds inhibit the late endosomal/lysosomal (LE/L) cholesterol export by blocking the cholesterol-transferring membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), resulting in accumulation of cholesterol in LE/L [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, we explore the antiviral capacity of both antifungals for the treatment of infections caused by various IAV and IBV subtypes
