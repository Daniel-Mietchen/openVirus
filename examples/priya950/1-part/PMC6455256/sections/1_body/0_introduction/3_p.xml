<p>A solid body of evidence links the cellular cholesterol metabolism with the innate immune response [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10â€“15</xref>]. Notably, type I interferon (IFN) signalling decreases cholesterol synthesis and elevates cholesterol import in macrophages [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In return, limiting cholesterol biosynthesis enhances type I IFN expression and stimulates the expression of IFN-dependent genes. Both observations are regarded as critical events of the antiviral response [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The activation of the IFN-induced immune response triggers the expression of several antiviral proteins like Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein 3 (IFITM3) that interfere with the fusion of viral and endosomal membrane [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In cells transfected with IFITM3, an endosomal accumulation of cholesterol has been observed, which is reported to function in the IFITM3 antiviral activity [
