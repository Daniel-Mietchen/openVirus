<p>Remarkably, endolysosomal cholesterol accumulation as an early antiviral barrier seems to be embedded in the antiviral response initiated upon type I IFN exposure [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The cholesterol imbalance is most likely why drug treatment moderately but significantly increased the expression of both IFN itself and IFN-stimulated genes in non-infected cells. In the context of infection, large amounts of type I IFNs are rapidly, yet transiently, produced. However, little is known about the host cell-mediated induction of IFNs via endogenous inflammatory factors in the absence of pathogens. Notably, low but sustained IFN production (picomolar concentrations) is already sufficient to induce a priming and thus an enhanced immune response upon microbial challenge, at least in macrophages [
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Such a host-elicited priming mechanism might be of special importance during the early infection phase, when IFN levels are still low, thus allowing primed cells to mount the antiviral response more rapidly. Interestingly, our data on the upregulation of IFN and select ISGs in drug-treated and subsequently IAV-infected cells compared to vehicle-treated infected cells suggest a priming function of the drugs, which might contribute to the observed inhibitory effect of itraconazole on IAV infection. However, we cannot exclude that the priming is elicited via drug-induced upregulation of other endogenous inflammatory factors that cause a subsequent IFN expression. Of note, the weak induction of
