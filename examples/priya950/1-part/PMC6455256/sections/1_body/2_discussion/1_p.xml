<p>IAV is a major threat to public health, mainly because of the annual epidemics, but also because of rare but severe pandemics [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The annual vaccine provides protection against currently circulating strains, but fails in a pandemic situation. Very few antiviral drugs are licensed and available for the treatment of influenza. Therefore, both the emergence of new strains and the acquisition of resistance poses problems which require novel solutions [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this regard, the interactions of the virus with components of the host cell are increasingly being discussed as targets of new antiviral therapies [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some of these host cell processes are targeted by existing drugs for other diseases [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, drug repurposing, the re-use of known drugs in novel applications, can accelerate the development of new antiviral drugs against IAV [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the present study, we investigated the use of the antifungal drugs itraconazole and posaconazole in the treatment of IAV infection. As expected with such established and widely used drugs, we did not detect any toxicity. Most importantly, both compounds were found to be highly effective in limiting IAV infection, with their EC
 <sub>50</sub> values below the micromolar value.
