<p>IFN treatment causes a general antiviral state and confers protection against a broad range of unrelated DNA and RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], yet the IFN-induced gene products are often virus-selective [
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Mechanistically, the specificity of the antiviral effect might depend on the IFN signature. Interestingly, itraconazole, which had a more pronounced antiviral effect, elicited 
 <italic>IFNβ</italic> upregulation more efficiently than posaconazole. However, the comparison of the data obtained in A549 cells and IFN-insensitive Vero cells clearly demonstrates an IFN-independent inhibitory mode of action. Appropriately, an inhibitory effect of drug pretreatment on IAV infection bypassing the endosomal route occurred only in A549 cells capable of IFN response and not in Vero cells. Thus, we assume that the potent inhibition of IAV infection in the first replication cycle in A549 cells presumably results from both components, the impaired endosomal escape and a weak priming of the IFN response. Importantly, itraconazole reduced IAV infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in the mouse model. The estimated HED was equivalent to 340 mg for a 60 kg human. As the recommended daily dose of itraconazole for therapy of fungal infections is 200–400 mg/day, and might be increased up to 600 mg/day for adults and severe infections, the dose used in the animal infection model is well within the range used in the treatment of fungal infections, and less than the maximum dose in human.
