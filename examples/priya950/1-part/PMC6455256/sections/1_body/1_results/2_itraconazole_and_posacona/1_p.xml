<p>To determine whether the IFN response is involved in the antiviral capability of itraconazole and posaconazole, we employed Vero cells which are genetically defective in the production of IFN [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Of note, we still observed a decrease of viral titers upon infection with IAV or VSV, although less pronounced (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(A), Suppl Fig. S1). Viral load was reduced up to 50% in itraconazole-pretreated Vero cells when compared to the control cells, and only a small reduction in viral titers of VSV in posaconazole-pretreated Vero cells was detected. (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(A), Suppl Figure S1). Thus, our results point to a partial involvement of the IFN system in mediating an antiviral effect of itraconazole and posaconazole. Because both antifungals elicited a more prominent decrease in viral titers of enveloped viruses in A549 and A431 cells, we next asked whether there was an itraconazole-mediated effect on the IFN system. Type I IFNs induce the transcriptional upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are, therefore, widely used as surrogate markers for induction of the IFN response both in experimental and clinical approaches [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Expression of the ISG 
 <italic>MX1</italic>, in particular, is exclusively induced via IFN, and is, therefore, a unique marker for IFN activity [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, we performed qPCR analysis for the type I IFNs 
 <italic>IFNα</italic> and 
 <italic>IFNβ</italic> and the ISGs 
 <italic>MX1 and IFITM3.</italic> Indeed, we found evidence for a weak induction of the IFN response. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(B), 
 <italic>IFNα</italic> mRNA levels were moderately, albeit significantly elevated upon itraconazole and posaconazole treatment, whereas 
 <italic>IFNβ</italic> levels were only altered upon itraconazole treatment. Notably, we confirmed that the enhanced basal expression level of 
 <italic>IFN</italic>-α/β was accompanied by moderately increased 
 <italic>MX1</italic>and 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> mRNA levels, suggesting weak alert of the cellular immune system prior to infection. Next, we explored the capacity of this weak induction observed in uninfected cells to affect a subsequent IAV infection. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(C), a more pronounced upregulation of 
 <italic>IFNα/β</italic> and the ISGs was observed in drug-treated infected cells compared to control-treated infected cells, indicating a drug-induced priming.
