<p>To delineate which early step in the IAV uptake was impaired, we performed acidic bypass infection experiments. This technique forces the artificial fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell plasma membrane in an acidified environment. As a consequence, the viral genome is directly transferred into the host cell cytoplasm, thus evading endocytic uptake and virus/endosome fusion [

 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, only neglectable levels of background staining were detected in the non-infected cells (see Suppl. Fig. 4 for gating strategy), and Bafilomycin A1 incubation potently inhibited IAV infection even under physiologic conditions. Under acidic bypass conditions, a robust number (23%) of DMSO-treated control cells were NP-positive. Interestingly, we detected a significantly lower number (âˆ¼15%) of infected A549 cells after pretreatment with both antifungal drugs. Notably, no impairment was observed in the interferon-insensitive Vero cells, suggesting that the activation of the interferon response by both drugs caused a compromised import of vRNPs into the host cell nucleus.
