<p>Both itraconazole and posaconazole have been shown to inhibit cholesterol export from the endolysosomal (LE/L) compartment [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interestingly, cholesterol imbalance within this compartment, where IAV endosomal escape occurs [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30â€“32</xref>], is linked to impaired transfer of the viral genome into the host cell cytosol, thus reducing infection success [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We, therefore, used the LE/L marker protein CD63 to identify LE/L, and filipin to specifically label the free cellular cholesterol. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, cholesterol accumulated in LE/L of A549 cells upon treatment with both antifungal drugs. To verify and quantitate the endosomal cholesterol imbalance, we next determined the degree of overlap of the CD63 signals with the filipin signals using the Manders' coefficient. This well-established method quantifies the intensity correlation of two fluorophores, and revealed that LE/L cholesterol levels were indeed significantly increased in itraconazole- and posaconazole-treated cells (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(A)). Because the more acidic pH encountered in LE/L is a key factor for the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membranes and the subsequent transfer of the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we next assessed whether the accumulation of cholesterol in LE/L, induced by both compounds, is accompanied by aberrant endosomal pH. Thus, we performed a quantitative ratiometric fluorescence microscopy assay. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(B), both drugs did not affect the endosomal low pH (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(B) and Suppl. Fig. 3). In addition, we biochemically quantified and compared cholesterol levels of vehicle-treated and drug-treated cells. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(C), in both itraconazole- and posaconazole-treated cells, the cholesterol amounts were not significantly altered upon drug treatment, indicating that the more pronounced endosomal filipin signal was due to elevated levels of LE/L cholesterol (presumably via inhibition of the endosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1 [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) rather than to a general change in cellular cholesterol.
