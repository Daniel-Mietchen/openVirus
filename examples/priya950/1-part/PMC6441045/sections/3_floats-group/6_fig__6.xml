  <p>Direct transmission cannot be established when HIV-1 sequences from two individuals are intermingled in deep-sequence phylogenies. It was previously proposed that certain patterns in deep-sequence phylogenies—intermingled subgraphs of two individuals as shown in panel (
   <bold>a</bold>) in red and blue—rule out the presence of unobserved common sources and/or intermediates, and could thus prove that direct transmission occurred between two individuals. We revisited this prediction on our data, and found two female−female pairs with mostly intermingled and near identical subgraphs across the genome. These data indicate that such deep-sequence phylogenetic relationships cannot exclude the possibility of unsampled common sources or intermediates. 
   <bold>a</bold> One deep-sequence phylogeny is shown for one female−female pair to illustrate their typical phylogenetic relationships. Reads from the two female−female pairs are shown in red and blue, are intermingled, and often nearly identical. The phylogenetically most closely related individuals that acted as controls are highlighted in colours, and reference sequences are shown in grey. One additional female (RkA06713F) was phylogenetically close to both females, though too poorly sampled to resolve phylogenetic relationship. The other individuals were phylogenetically distant or disconnected from the two females by HIV-1 reference sequences, with no relationship to the two females inferred. Deep-sequence phylogenies of all other windows are shown in Supplementary Data
