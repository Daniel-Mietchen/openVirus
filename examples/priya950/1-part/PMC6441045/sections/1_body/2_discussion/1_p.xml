 </sup>. In contrast, deep-sequence phylogenetic analyses are based on thousands of reads per individual, and thereby provide more information into the epidemiologic relationship of individuals beyond distance measures, through the topological ordering between subgraphs of viral reads from individuals. Prior work assessed the potential of deep-sequence phylogenetic analyses on simulations and on known transmission pairs for whom at least five viral sequences were available per individual
