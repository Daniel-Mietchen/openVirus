<p id="Par21">We found that when many reads from different individuals are analysed together, they tend to form subgraphs with consistent ordering in deep-sequence phylogenies from across the genome. This observation enabled us to infer the source of transmission in 77.9% of 376 phylogenetically linked male−female pairs. The accuracy of our viral phylogenetic inferences regarding directionality was validated on 71 male−female pairs with clinical data that suggested transmission in one direction, with an overall false discovery rate of 16.6% [9.1–28.7%], and was thus not substantially different in a population-based sample compared to analysis of couples with known direction of transmission
