<p id="Par23">Whole-genome deep-sequencing is now the tool of choice in clinical practice and epidemiologic investigation for a broad range of bacterial infectious disease pathogens, and increasingly used for viral pathogens, and especially HIV-1

 </sup>. Here we establish that HIV-1 phylogenetic analyses can be scaled to large population-based samples of deep-sequence data, and that the direction of transmission can be frequently inferred in reconstructed HIV-1 transmission networks. At present, more than 15,000 individuals have been deep-sequenced and linked to demographic records across sub-Saharan Africa in order to understand who is at the core and driving new infections where the burden of HIV-1 is highest, how the epidemic regenerates from older to younger generations, and how spread can be most effectively interrupted in generalized epidemics

 </sup>. The phyloscanner method is applicable to these data, and we hypothesize that this innovation will help identify the key drivers of HIV-1 transmission in regions that are hardest hit by the virus, and in turn facilitate tailoring of interventions to achieve epidemic control.
