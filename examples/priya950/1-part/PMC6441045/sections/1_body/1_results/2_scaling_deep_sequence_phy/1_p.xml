<p id="Par8">We first investigated the types of deep-sequence phylogenetic patterns that arise in known epidemiologic relationships. Our population-based sample comprised 331 concordant HIV-1-positive couples who self-identified as sexual partners. Based on previous partner analyses

 </sup>, we expected that virus was transmitted in approximately 70% of couples, and that the remaining couples were separately infected by other individuals. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> illustrates a typical scan of deep-sequence phylogenies across the genome for three male−female pairs. In each phylogeny, subgraphs of reads from two individuals could either be ancestral to each other (pink if virus of the female was ancestral and blue if virus of the male was ancestral), siblings (purple), intermingled (yellow), or disconnected by one or more other individuals (grey, see Methods for full definitions and Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> for command line specifications of the phyloscanner software). In addition, the shortest patristic distance between subgraphs of reads from two individuals (in short: subgraph distance) reflected genetic similarity of their viruses (

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> summarizes these deep-sequence phylogenetic patterns across known couples. We found, first, that the distribution of subgraph distances separating partners was bimodal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, showing the median distance per pair across all their phylogenies after standardizing for differences in evolutionary rates across the genome). Most couples were either phylogenetically closely related or distantly related, with intermediate distances being very rare. This suggested that transmission likely occurred among phylogenetically closely related couples, and allowed us to define distance thresholds below which transmission was likely and above which transmission could be ruled out in this population (respectively &lt;0.025 substitutions per site and &gt;0.05 substitutions per site, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Additional analysis of whole-genome consensus sequences further supported these findings and thresholds (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and ref.

 </sup>). Second, we found that the large majority (166/178, 93.3%) of phylogenetically close couples also had ancestral subgraphs in most deep-sequence phylogenies, indicating in line with Leitner and Romero-Severson
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup> that ancestral subgraph topologies are strongly over-represented among true transmission pairs.
