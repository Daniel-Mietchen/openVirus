<p id="Par17">In 35 pairs, one individual had a CD4 cell count above 800 cells per mm
 <sup>3 </sup>blood, indicative of being close to time of infection, while their partner was already immuno-compromised with a CD4 cell count below 400 cells per mm
 <sup>3</sup> blood. The phylogenetically inferred source was consistent with clinical evidence in 19/35 pairs, inconsistent in 5/35 pairs, and could not be inferred reliably in 11/35 pairs. In two of the five inconsistent cases, CD4 data were only weakly indicative of the direction of transmission, and it is possible that we overestimated error rates for these pairs with CD4 data to 20.8% [9.2–40.5%] (Supplementary Note
