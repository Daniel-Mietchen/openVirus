<p id="Par14">These findings put into context that 81 (15.1%) of the 537 highly supported phylogenetic linkages were between two men. Given that the relative proportion of same-sex linkages were equivalent between men and women, our phylogenetic transmission networks provide no evidence of extensive sub-epidemics amongst men who have sex with men in rural Rakai although we cannot rule out the possibility that these may exist due to potential undersampling of widely stigmatized key populations
