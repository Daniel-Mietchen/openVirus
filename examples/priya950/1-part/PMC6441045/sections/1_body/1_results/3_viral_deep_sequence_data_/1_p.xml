<p id="Par11">We hypothesized that many of the 537 highly supported phylogenetic linkages were false discoveries in that transmission did not occur directly between the paired individuals. Our population-based sample did not capture all members of ongoing transmission chains, and so transmission likely occurred via unsampled intermediates in some cases. 80/537 (14.9%) of highly supported phylogenetic linkages were between two women even though HIV-1 is predominantly sexually transmitted in Africa, and extremely rarely transmitted sexually between women

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> that up to 35.4% of phylogenetically close male−female pairs of the population-based sample may not represent direct transmission events. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> illustrates this fundamental problem further: subgraph distances and topologies were not sufficient to clearly separate pairs of individuals from the population sample into two groups of closely related or distantly related pairs.
