 </sup> proposed that direct transmission can be established with near certainty when viral sequences from two individuals are heavily intermingled in deep-sequence phylogenies. This prediction, while based on theoretical evolutionary principles and simulation, implies that deep-sequence phylogenies could be used in criminal cases of HIV-1 transmissions, and thus has important public health and human rights implications.
