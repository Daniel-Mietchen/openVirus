 </sup>. This may enable better targeting of prevention measures to infected people who most likely act as sources of new infection, and thus reduce transmission amongst groups most likely to sustain the epidemic. HIV-1 evolves faster than transmissions occur, so that viral sequences obtained from an individual tend to be characteristic of that individual within weeks after infection

 </sup>. Therefore, viral genetic data have the potential to yield novel insights into the drivers of transmission by identifying who may have been a transmitter, and then by generalizing these findings to identify risk factors that can be directly targeted for prevention
