The accuracy in reconstructing the direction of transmission is sufficient to infer source populations, i.e. the most likely drivers of the epidemic, without assumptions on the epidemic. This finding turns into practice the theoretical prediction by Romero-Severson et al.

 </sup> investigated which phylogenetic orderings of subgraphs (in short: subgraph topologies) can be expected among known transmission pairs. The primary aim of this study is the opposite, to establish what epidemiologic inferences can be made from observed patterns in deep-sequence phylogenies. Our population-level analysis is based on deep-sequence data that was cross-sectionally collected from 40 communities in the Rakai region of Southern Uganda. Rakai communities are predominantly small agrarian and semi-urban trading centres as well as fishing communities alongside Lake Victoria. The area was the initial epicentre of the HIV-1 epidemic in Eastern Africa, and today remains among the highest burdened districts in Uganda with an overall adult HIV prevalence that ranges from 9–26% among inland trading and agrarian communities to 38–43% among lakeside fishing communities
