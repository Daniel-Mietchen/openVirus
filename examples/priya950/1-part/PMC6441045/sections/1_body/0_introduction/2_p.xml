<p id="Par4">Currently, phylogenetic tools to identify sources of transmission are based on Sanger sequencing, which generates a single HIV-1 consensus sequence per virus sample from an individual
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Typically one sample per individual is sequenced, and so the entire viral population from one individual is reduced into a single consensus sequence, which is insufficient to determine in which direction infections occurred
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. For this reason source attribution methods have required data on dates of infection
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup> or modelling assumptions on the epidemic

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. An advantage of source attribution methods based on additional modelling assumptions is that they may be applied with relatively small sample sizes, although it can be hard to disentangle assumptions from conclusions. For example, in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>, it was assumed that young women are predominantly infected by older men in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and it is unclear to what extent the same conclusion is based on data
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. There is consequently a need for broadly applicable source attribution methods that are not dependent on external modelling assumptions to provide independent evidence.
