 </sup>. Briefly, the RCCS conducts a census in all communities to identify eligible individuals 2 weeks before the survey. Eligible individuals include those able to give consent and between the ages of 15 and 49 years. Eligible individuals who provide written informed consent are administered a survey on their demographs, sexual behaviours and health-care seeking practices. Individuals are also asked to name their cohabitating sexual partners in order to identify couples, and to provide a serum sample for HIV-1 testing and future laboratory studies, including HIV-1 viral sequencing. Data for this particular study were collected between 2011 and 2015 from 40 agrarian, trading and fishing communities.
