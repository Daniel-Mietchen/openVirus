<p id="Par26">To estimate the number of infected participants with unsuppressed virus, we first calculated the expected number of infected participants who did not use antiretrovirals at time of survey, and had thus unsuppressed virus. Participant reported ART use was previously validated as a proxy of actual ART use with a specificity of 99%
