  <p>Heterogeneity in host cell susceptibility reduces the total size of infected cells. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The final sizes (fractions) of infected cells at the end of infection [Average 
   <italic>R</italic>(∞)], in a model using two identical layers of ER graphs. Results are average of 1,000 simulations. Colored lines show simulations assuming different levels of heterogeneities in host-cell susceptibility. The heterogeneity is characterized by a gamma distribution with the shape parameter 
   <italic>k</italic> and scale parameters θ. Note, the lower the value of 
   <italic>k</italic>, the more heterogeneous the host cell susceptibility. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The corresponding final sizes (fractions) of protected cells at the end of infection, 
   <italic>P</italic>(∞), in simulations shown in 
   <bold>(A)</bold>. 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> Similar plots as in 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold>, respectively, except that the model assumes GR graphs in the network. The individual-cell effectiveness of the IFN signaling, 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>F</italic>
   </sub> is set to seven. The average degree of the networks is set to 40, such that the value of 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>I</italic>
   </sub> reaches 10 in simulations assuming 
   <italic>k</italic> = 0.1 and θ = 20.
