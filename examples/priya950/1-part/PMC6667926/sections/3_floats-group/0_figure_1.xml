  <p>The multiplex network framework for the dynamics of virus infection and the IFN response. In the framework, cells are represented as nodes of the network. Two layers are considered, i.e., the infection layer and the protection layer. The nodes are shared between the two layers. Infected cells (I) produce viruses and IFNs (not considered explicitly in the model). Viruses infect susceptible cells (S) to become infected cells (I) through the infection layer, whereas IFNs spread and signal to susceptible cells to turn them to protected cells (P) through the protection layer. Infected cells die over time to become cells in the R class. We consider the impact of the overlap between the two layers and the topology of the two layers on the effectiveness of the IFN response to stop viral spread on the network.</p>
