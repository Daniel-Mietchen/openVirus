<p>Given that the IFN response is a highly optimized and highly effective general response against viruses (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), we argue that the strategies employed by IFN and the results derived from this work could shed light on or lead to solutions to problems in other disciplines. For example, network models are frequently used in the modeling of epidemics to understand how infection dynamics or control strategies are impacted by network topologies (
