<p>During systematic infection, viral infection process can be spatial or non-spatial. For viruses like HIV, infection in the blood and in the lymph nodes occurs among host cells that move around and contact each other randomly, the infection process may be better modeled using a random (ER) network. We show that in this case, the critical parameter that determines the effectiveness of IFN protection of target cells is the similarity between the infection layer and the protection layer (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The higher the similarity, the more effective the IFN response. The IFN response can halt/suppress infection by directly competing with viruses at each individual cell level such that the number of target cells that each infected cell can infect is reduced. For many other viruses, e.g., influenza virus (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and HCV (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), spatial viral spread may be prevalent throughout the infection course, if not the only infection mode.
