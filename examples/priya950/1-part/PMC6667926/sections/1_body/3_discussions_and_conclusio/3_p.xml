<p>The findings of our study, especially that IFN response is effective when infection spreads in a spatial manner, are consistent with a wide range of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> observations. For example, imaging of liver biopsy from patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) showed that HCV infected cells form clusters and that IFN stimulated genes are highly expressed in infected cells as well as the surrounding susceptible cells. This strongly suggests effective IFN response to constrain cell-to-cell spatial spread in the liver (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), to understand the evolutionary trade-off of viral suppression of the IFN response, Domingo-Calap et al. compared the spread of a wild-type strain of the vesicular stomatitis virus to a mutant strain that stimulates stronger IFN response than the wild-type. Real-time fluorescence microscopy showed that in contrast to a faster and homogenous spread of the wild-type virus in monolayer host cells, the mutant viruses spread slower and infected cells form clusters. This again suggests that the IFN response triggered by the mutant acts to constrain infection. Interestingly, when the monolayer spatial structure of host cells is disrupted, the mutant grew faster than the wild-type in well-mixed culture. This is consistent with the results we show in this study that spatial structure is a key determinant of the effectiveness of the IFN response. Overall, these experimental observations support our model predictions, and thus, our model serves a useful tool to understand the quantitative principles of the IFN response. These understandings may lead to development of effective therapies/vaccines to prevent virus transmission and infection (
