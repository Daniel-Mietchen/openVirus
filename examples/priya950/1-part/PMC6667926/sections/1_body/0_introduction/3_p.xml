<p>To address these questions, we take a mathematical modeling approach using multiplex networks. Previous modeling works on virus dynamics and the IFN response focused on interpreting

 <italic>in vivo</italic> systematic infection dynamics (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). For example, several elegant studies combining both single-cell experiments and mathematical modeling showed the importance of the timing of the IFN response in determining the outcome of an infection of a population of cells (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Two modeling works incorporated the IFN response into within-host viral dynamic models and showed that the IFN response can reduce the peak viral load during an influenza infection and explain the viral load plateau observed after peak viremia (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In this work, we introduce a multiplex network approach to understand virus invasion of a host and the immediate IFN response. In this framework, we assume in the multiplex network that virus and IFN molecules mediate contacts between cells through the infection layer and the protection layer, respectively. By considering different types of network topologies, i.e., reflecting host cell contact patterns, we show how the IFN response can effectively and robustly respond to virus infection especially in the initial site of viral exposure/infection where host cells are likely arranged spatially in the peripheral tissue.
