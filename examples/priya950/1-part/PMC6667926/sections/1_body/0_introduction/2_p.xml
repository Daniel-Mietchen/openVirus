<p>IFN molecules belong to a group of signaling proteins, known as cytokines, used by the immune system for cell-to-cell communication and induction of protective response. Upon infection, detection of viral RNA/DNA in the host cell triggers a signaling cascade and gene regulation, resulting in the production of IFNs (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These IFNs then exit the infected cell and act as signaling molecules to bind to surface receptors located on the membranes of host cells (a process termed the IFN signaling), leading to induction of antiviral genes and thus an antiviral state in those cells (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). If an IFN molecule reaches an uninfected cell, i.e., paracrine signaling, this anti-viral state renders the cell refractory to viral infection. If an IFN molecule binds to the receptor of the infected cell that produces it, i.e., autocrine signaling, it inhibits viral replication and decreases the quantity of viral progeny being shed from that cell (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although the molecular mechanisms of the IFN response in individual cells have been well characterized (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), the collective dynamics of the host cell response arising from communications through IFN signaling and how the IFN response can effectively and robustly stop or suppress viral infections especially during the initial period of viral exposure in different peripheral tissues and different types of host cells are not understood.
