<p>In this model, susceptible cells (S) are infected at rate β or become protected at rate φ. Since we mainly focus on the initial infection dynamics, generation and death of susceptible cells are ignored. Infected cells (
 <italic>I</italic>) die at per capita rate γ to become cells in the 
 <italic>R</italic> class. We assume that protected cells remain protected for simplicity, although anti-viral response in protected cells can be switched off over time (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Again, since we are mostly interested in the initial infection dynamics, ignoring the transition from protected cells to susceptible cells is a reasonable assumption. Here, we mainly focus on how the topology of a network impacts on the effectiveness of IFN to halt an infection through protecting susceptible cells, i.e., the paracrine IFN signaling. The impact of IFN on already-infected cells can be considered by extending the model with another infected class, i.e., infected cells that are at an antiviral state, and assume that infected cells in this class have a reduced viral production. However, this makes many analytical derivations impossible. Note that as a common practice in the network modeling approach, we rescale the four state variables against the total population size, such that 
 <italic>S</italic> + 
 <italic>I</italic> + 
 <italic>P</italic> + 
 <italic>R</italic> = 1. Then, 
 <italic>S, I, P</italic>, and 
 <italic>R</italic> in our network models represent the fraction of cells that are in their corresponding states.
