<p>Then, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>F</italic>
 </sub> is the average number of cells that an infected cell protects over its life time. Note that, protected cells do not further generate IFN and thus IFN signaling does not propagate in the absence of further infection. Thus, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>F</italic>
 </sub> is a single step measure of the effectiveness of the IFN signaling for individual cell response, and we refer this parameter as the individual-cell effectiveness of the IFN signaling.
