<p>To understand why IFN protection of target cells works well in the GR network, we show two simulation realizations using networks assuming two ER graphs and two GR graphs in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>, respectively. In the network with two ER graphs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), connections/links between nodes are random. As a result, infection can propagate until most cells are either protected or infected/recovered. In contrast, cells in the GR network are connected only to neighboring cells in space. If the IFN response is strong enough, the IFN signaling can build up an outer layer of protected cells which effectively contains the infection near the site of initial infection. As a result, most of the cells (outside of the area of infection) stay susceptible without being infected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Overall, the results suggest that the IFN response, i.e., the IFN signaling to protect susceptible cells, works extremely effectively when the virus spread spatially, a likely scenario for infections in tissues.
