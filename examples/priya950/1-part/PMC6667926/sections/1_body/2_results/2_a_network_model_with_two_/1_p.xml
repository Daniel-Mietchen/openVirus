<p>For most viruses, initial viral infection events at the site of viral entry are expected to occur at the peripheral tissue where host cells are spatially structured. Spatial infection spread has also been shown to be a prominent infection mode of many viruses, especially for virus infections in the tissue (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). To evaluate the effectiveness of the IFN response in tissue, we constructed a multiplex network where the two layers are assumed to be GR graphs (see Methods). In the GR graph, we define nodes on a two-dimensional space and a maximal distance (i.e., radius of virus or IFN diffusion) such that an edge exists between two nodes only if the distance between two nodes is shorter than the radius of diffusion.
