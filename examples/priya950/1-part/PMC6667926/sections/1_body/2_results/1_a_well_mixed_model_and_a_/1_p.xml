<p>We first focused on multiplex networks where both layers are ER graphs as baseline models. In this framework, contacts between host cells (through viruses and IFNs) are random and there is no spatial structure in the contacts. These assumptions are reasonable for infections where cells move and contact with other cells (through viruses and IFNs) roughly randomly, for example, HIV infection in the blood. In our multiplex network model, the topologies of the graphs in the two layers, i.e., the contact structure between cells, can be explicitly modeled, in contrast to well-mixed models or single-layer network models. This allows us investigate how the IFN signaling through the protection layer competes with virus infection through the infection layer at the level of individual infected cells.</p>
