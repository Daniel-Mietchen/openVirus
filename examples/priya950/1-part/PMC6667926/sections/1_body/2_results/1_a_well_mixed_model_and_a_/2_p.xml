<p>We considered two scenarios of the relationship between the two layers, i.e., the topologies of the two layers are independent of or identical to each other. We simulated the model and analyzed how the fractions of infected and then dead cells (a measure of the size of total infected cells) and protected cells (
 <italic>R</italic>(∞) and 
 <italic>P</italic>(∞), respectively) changes with the infectivity of the virus (measured as 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub>; see Method). When the two layers are independent of each other, the subset of target cells that an IFN molecule can reach is independent from the subset that a virus (produced from the same cell as the IFN molecule) reaches, and thus there is no direct competition for target cells between viruses and IFNs at the individual infected cell level. We found that the predicted infection threshold value for virus infectivity, β
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>, i.e., the threshold value that viruses can cause sustained infection in a host, is independent of the parameter that governs the IFN protection of target cells, i.e., φ. On the other hand, when the two layers are identical (i.e., a more biologically relevant assumption), IFN molecules will reach to the same subset of target cells as the viruses produced from the same infected cell. In this case, the infection threshold becomes much larger than the threshold in the absence of IFN response, suggesting that IFN can prevent virus infection (the green line in

 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>, there is a sharp increase in the number of protected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This increase in protected cells prevents susceptible cells from being infected and thus the proportion of infected cells increases slowly with increases in
