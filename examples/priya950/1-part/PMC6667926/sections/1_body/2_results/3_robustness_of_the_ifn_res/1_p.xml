<p>The IFN response is a general response strategy employed by different types of host cells to prevent or suppress infections of a variety of viruses. This suggests that the IFN response works efficiently and robustly in a wide range of host cell or tissue environments. Here, we evaluated the robustness of the IFN response against variations in two assumptions in our model to understand how this collective host cell response work effectively despite heterogenous host environments.</p>
