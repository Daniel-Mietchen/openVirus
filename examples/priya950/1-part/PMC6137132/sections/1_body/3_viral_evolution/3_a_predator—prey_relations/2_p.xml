<p>Antibody-mediated immunity to influenza viruses is well-understood. Vaccines success is based on this response. Despite this, vaccines are ineffective in many people. One reason is that cellular immunity through T cells is also a very important immunological response (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Antibody variability is a genetically intrinsic mechanism of B cells. However, T-cell response is based on MHC (HLA) proteins efficiency that differs among individuals and is an inherited trait. Recognition of viral proteins on the surface of infected cells is performed through MHC proteins. There are thousands of genetic polymorphisms in the MHC genes at the population level, producing millions of combinations. These combinations are inherited in the form of “genes packages” termed as haplotypes (each person carries two MHC haplotypes). It is unlikely for two individuals to carry a single common haplotype. Some MHC proteins (haplotypes) are more effective than others in recognizing viral proteins. Why is there this vast diversity of MHC proteins in human populations? The answer is that this increases the likelihood that some individuals will survive after a severe pandemic and this way a species extinction is avoided. On the other hand, we can assume that haplotypes that exist today are the ones that were successful in the past for combating specific viral or bacterial infections. Survivors passed these haplotypes onto next generations. Of course, as it was stated before, viruses are not stable entities. Mutations increase the number of viral types and some of them will finally “win” the previously successful MHC proteins causing again the (human) population to be susceptible. This is quite similar with the predator-prey relationship happening extensively in nature (Figure
