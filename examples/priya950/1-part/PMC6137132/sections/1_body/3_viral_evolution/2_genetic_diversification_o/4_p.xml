<p>One of the most interesting recent findings regarding influenza virus' genetic variability and evolution is that when people become infected, they are actually infected from a diversity of viruses and not from only one strain (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). This implies that vaccines target the dominant strain and not the whole population of viruses. Most of these viral strains are not well adapted but can stay for long inside a human (or other species) population, thus hiding the danger to gain a gradual adaptation through mutation accumulation processes (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). It is obvious that natural selection can determine which viral variants can survive and which cannot. Additionally, this multi-infection process may be related with cooperation or competition phenomena among viruses, that currently are not so well understood (
