<p>Both T and B cells are essential in the adaptive immune response to influenza virus infection. Naive CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, upon activation by dendritic cells and facilitated by the action of cytokines, proliferate and differentiate to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CTLs are able to kill influenza virus-infected cells and also restrict viral replication via production of cytokines and effector molecules like perforin and granzymes (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Memory CTLs cells can respond efficiently during a secondary infection and confer cross-protective heterosubtypic immunity (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Moreover, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells express co-stimulatory molecules that participate in antibody production by B cells. At the same time, antiviral cytokines, like INF-γ, TNF, and IL-2 are expressed from Th1 CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, which also help activate alveolar macrophages. Th2 CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to B cell specific responses (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Comprising an essential defense mechanism against influenza virus infection, B cells generate neutralizing (hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibodies) as well as non-neutralizing antibodies (anti-NA and antibodies against structural proteins). The latter, as well as specific antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, play an important role in cross-protection against different influenza subtypes (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). There is increased interest in the role of cross-reactive T cells and broadly neutralizing antibodies in the development of vaccines that could elicit “universal” immunity against different or novel strains of influenza viruses.
