<p>Influenza viruses target epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, which contain SA receptors. Epithelial cells across species express different SA receptors and Influenza A virus strains show a predilection for certain types of such receptors, making zoonotic transmission difficult. For example, human influenza strains have a predilection for SA α-2,6 galactose receptors, which are found in the respiratory epithelium of the upper airways in humans, while animal influenza A viruses bind to SA α-2,3 galactose, which is found on the epithelial cells of birds and pigs, but could also be expressed in the human lower respiratory tract epithelium (
