<p>In the present study, we found that epidemiological characteristics in KD were most similar to those in APN or ES among the 8 evaluated diseases. In age distribution, these 3 diseases had an age predilection in infancy and young children; 79.7% of patients in APN, 95.8% in ES, and 50.1% in KD were 0–1 years of age, and 87.5% of patients in APN, near 100% in ES, and 91.7% in KD were 0–4 years of age. In the view of epidemiological and clinical aspects, an infected infant with pathogens from these diseases are difficult to disperse the pathogens to other infants. Other diseases showed a relatively even age-distribution throughout childhood, though peak ages were slightly different across the diseases. This suggests that younger children may have less chance on exposure to the pathogens and older children and young adult groups may have immunity or tolerability to the pathogens causing the diseases.</p>
