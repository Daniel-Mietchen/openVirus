<p>Based on the data from epidemiological and clinical studies of KD, the pathogenesis of KD could be explained as follows. Along with economic growth and westernization in East Asian countries in order of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China, a species in normal flora (microbiota) in people may be affected by environmental changes such as improved hygiene or increased consumption of westernized foods including red meats (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These species (KD agents) slowly spread via colonization as normal flora to other people, including the parents and guardians of KD patients, and are eventually colonized in infants and young children predisposed to KD. On occasion, colonized KD agents invade the host via unknown events; if they are intestinal commensals, a mechanism similar to APN (via hematogeneous route in young infants) may be activated (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Invading KD pathogens make a focus (replication site) elsewhere within the host, possibly near the upper respiratory or intestinal tracts (portal of entry) or in the target organ via systemic or local circulation. The majority of patients infected by the KD agents may be asymptomatic and have self-limited disease. However, during or after recovery from this infection, similar to ARF or APSGN, KD develops when the substances from a focus spread abruptly into systemic circulation (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). There are various incubation periods in ARF and APSGN after initial GAS infection, and no intact pathogens or structural components of the pathogen have been detected in the pathologic lesions in ARF, APSGN, KD, and other infection-related immune-mediated diseases. Furthermore, GAS strains can reside in intracellular compartments in host cells such as tonsillar epithelial cells and macrophages (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), and small extracellular bacteria such as mycoplasma species can proliferate within cells and spread to other organ cells (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the etiologic substances may originate from injured host cells, including a kind of DAMPs, or from immune cells exposed to infectious insults, than from various pathogens. Immune/repair system of the host, including immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgM) and platelets, begin to control the substances and take part in tissue cell repair (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Thus, the prognoses of KD and other immune-mediated diseases depend on the ability of the host immune system to control the diverse substances from target cells injured by initial insults. Early immune modulators (corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin) may act on hyperactive immune reactions performed by the non-specific adaptive immune cells (T cells and B cells) in the early stage of each disease (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). However, despite early treatment, a few patients with KD experience severe or giant aneurysms, and these patients may have insufficient immune function to control the substances originating from injured target cells (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Young children with immature immune function may be prone to invasion of KD pathogens as occurs in APN in infants, and the probability of invasion of KD agents in young children may be similar across different populations (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Since microbiota may differ across populations, marked differences in racial incidence in KD or other immune-mediated diseases such as HSP, inflammatory bowel disease, and Bechet disease may be associated with the colonization state of the different etiologic agents in the populations (
