<p>It is hypothesized that KD may have an etiologic agent(s), although many studies searching for the etiology of KD have failed. Etiologic agents in infectious diseases originate from an external source and invade into the host. However, at present time, they could be classified as exogenous pathogens and the endogenous pathogens; the former is generally accepted as agents that are newly introduced to humans from other animal species or other places, whereas the latter originates from the host in the forms of normal flora (or commensals) or those becoming a normal flora from initially being an exogenous pathogen. For examples, measles in immune-innocent populations in the past and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were caused by new external pathogens. On the other hand, the pathogens causing APN or acute otitis media, such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> or 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, could be categorized as endogenous pathogens. It is well-known that a newly introduced disease by an exogenous pathogen has affected all aged persons in a population and spread to other populations in relatively a short-time period of time after its first emergence. Over time, infected persons and groups have immunity to the pathogens, and young children and infants would remain susceptible, especially during cyclic epidemic viral infections. Accordingly, epidemiologic characteristics of infectious diseases or infection-related diseases in the populations at a given time may differ.
