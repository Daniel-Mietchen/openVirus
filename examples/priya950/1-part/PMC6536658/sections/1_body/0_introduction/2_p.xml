<p>The clinical manifestations of Kawasaki disease share similarities in some aspects of viral diseases, bacterial diseases, or infection-related immune mediated diseases such as systemic juvenile idiopathic rheumatoid arthritis or acute rheumatic fever (ARF). However, extensive studies searching for the etiologic agent(s) have turned up as failures until the present time (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Common childhood infectious diseases and infection-related immune-mediated diseases, including KD, childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenia, and Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (HSP) have low prevalence in older children and adults. Thus, these childhood diseases have been hypothesized to be associated with infections caused by unknown pathogens (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Since KD is an acute self-limiting systemic inflammation that involves multiple organs, it has been proposed that there are etiologic substances that induce systemic inflammation and target cell injuries, including coronary artery lesions (CALs), during or after the infection with KD pathogen (s) (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The epidemiological characteristics of a disease may aid in predicting the etiologic agent(s) of the disease. The identification of KD etiology is essential for understanding the disease, and the development of diagnostic tools and adequate treatment modalities.
