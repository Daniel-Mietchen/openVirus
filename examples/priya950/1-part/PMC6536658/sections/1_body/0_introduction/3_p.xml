<p>In this study, to predict the etiology of KD, we evaluated and compared epidemiological characteristics between KD and common infectious diseases or immune-mediated diseases in children. After evaluating epidemiological parameters focused on age distribution, annual-case pattern and monthly-case pattern, we found that the epidemiological profiles in KD were similar to those in acute pyelonephritis (APN) or exanthema subitum (ES). We discussed the implications of these findings in KD epidemiology in Korea.</p>
