<p>Cyclic epidemics caused by possibly new strains of pathogens, such as macrolide-resistant strains were noted in MP pneumonia and in aseptic meningitis caused by mainly enteroviruses; all had similar patterns with nationwide epidemics or outbreaks in Korea (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Influenza occurred every winter and early spring, but the number of cases and peak epidemic months were different in 2009 pandemic and seasonal influenza, across seasonal influenza after 2009 pandemic [(
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), unpublished observation]. Relatively an even, but fluctuating annual cases were noted in KD, APN, ES, HSP, and childhood asthma, except APSGN (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The mean annual cases in each disease are shown 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and the results may be helpful to estimate the incidence of each disease in our city, since nationwide KD epidemiological studies in Korea have been performed every 3 years (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). There was a trend of decreasing number of cases in the recent years or decades in APSGN, HSP and childhood asthma, whereas an increasing trend was noted in APN, compared to the past years or decades (
