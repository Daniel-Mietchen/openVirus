<p>Influenza surface protein HA from different strains have a broad spectrum of glycosylation pattern that influences the antigenicity. In this perspective, plant-based vaccine production would be the relevant system to cope with seasonal and pandemic influenza since influenza HA vaccine with variable glycosylation pattern could be produced after the expression of HA antigen in the host plant with different degree of mutations in glycosylation-related genes. The vaccine with a broad spectrum of antigenicity could be produced transiently in
