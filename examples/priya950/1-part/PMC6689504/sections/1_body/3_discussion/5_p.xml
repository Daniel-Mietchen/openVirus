<p>While employing a geminiviral vector expression system, native signal peptide at N terminus of HA resulted in higher level of rHA in lettuce and tobacco (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Minimally-glycosylated rHA can be achieved by expressing the HA fused with ER retention signal KDEL which may possibly have different antigenicity than the original complex-glycosylated form (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). The rHA retained in ER presented the smaller size 64 kDa than 75 kDa. The size difference of rHA protein in two different cellular compartment may be accredited by the absence and presence of complex glycan. The glycosylation pattern analysis may provide direct evidence for the difference between the complex-glycosylated and basal-glycosylated proteins. To support our data, it was shown that the bigger HA protein size than calculated was observed when produced in the apoplast and smaller protein size when expressed in the chloroplast [
