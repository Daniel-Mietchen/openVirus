<p>The efficient production of a particular recombinant protein in a plant is a challenging because there are many combinatorial parameters governing the successful expression of the proteins. In order to find a right expression vector and the appropriate host plant that express the HA (H3N2) efficiently, we rationally chose DNA viral vector system and tested transient expression in the two host plants. In addition, to prevent the species-specific bias in the codon usage, synonymous mutations were introduced for optimal expression. So prior to cloning, we optimized the viral specific codon of HA from influenza A/canine/Korea/S3001/2015 (H3N2) towards the usage of preferred codon in tobacco and lettuce avoiding the use of rare codons that could negatively impact on HA expression.</p>
