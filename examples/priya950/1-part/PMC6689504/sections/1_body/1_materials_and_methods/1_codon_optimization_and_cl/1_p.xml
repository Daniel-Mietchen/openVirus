<p>The amino acid and nucleotide sequence information were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and Uniprot databases. The codons were first optimized to improve the expression in tobacco and lettuce. Since the codon usage by the specific amino acid in the human and within the different plant also vary, the codons were optimized based on the codon usage table of the

 <italic>L. sativa</italic> available at Kazusa DNA Research Institute (

Importantly, the distribution of codon in the protein was maintained and the codon with zero usage frequency in the Rubisco and ubiquitin was avoided or used at a minimum. The optimized sequences of the full length of HA including the native signal peptide were synthesized (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea;
