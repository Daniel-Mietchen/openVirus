<p id="p0030">There is worldwide disagreement about the potential ability of the mosquito species 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> to transmit DENV and ZIKV 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Although no investigation with any FP population of 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> has been conducted for DENV, laboratory experiments found no evidence for FP populations to be able to transmit ZIKV, in accordance with the majority of published studies 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Nevertheless, the controversial results found for the ability of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species from various countries to transmit DENV or ZIKV, and the unexpected slowness of ZIKV dissemination in experiments conducted in laboratory conditions on 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations, particularly 
 <italic>A. polynesiensis</italic>, raised questions about the possibility that field conditions may significantly impact the ability of these species to sustain viral propagation
