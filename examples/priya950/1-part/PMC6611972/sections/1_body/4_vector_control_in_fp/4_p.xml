<p id="p0070">The mosquito vectors described in this review are known to be able to transmit several arboviruses that have never been detected in FP. For example, 
 <italic>C. annulirostris</italic>, 
 <italic>C. sitiens</italic> and 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> may transmit Japanese encephalitis virus 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and, with 
 <italic>A. vexans</italic>, West Nile virus 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is a vector of yellow fever virus 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Consequently, these arboviruses are a risk for FP. Mosquitoes are vectors of infectious diseases but the role of humans remains central in the introduction of viruses to the region. Vector control remains inseparable from increased surveillance of human transport flows at the international points of entry of FP (i.e. port and airport).
