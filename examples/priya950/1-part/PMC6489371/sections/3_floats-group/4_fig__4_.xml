  <title>reconstructed spatiotemporal diffusion of the Yellow Fever virus (YFV)
   <sub>RJ-I</sub> lineage. The branches of the YFV
   <sub>RJ-I</sub> lineage phylogeny were arranged in space (map of Rio de Janeiro state with municipalities borders) according the locations of known (external) and inferred (internal) nodes (circles). The blue shaded regions represent the 95% credible regions of the inferred internal nodes. The branch thickness represents the spread direction (thin to thick) between locations. The inset shows a close view of viral dissemination, with the municipalities’ names. ES: Espírito Santo state.
