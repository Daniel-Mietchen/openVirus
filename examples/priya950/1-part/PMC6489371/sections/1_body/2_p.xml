 </xref> In the third cycle (July 2018 to June 2019), no human case has been recorded till date (February 2019) in RJ. Only one epizootic of NHPs in this season was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IMH) in the southernmost municipality in RJ (Paraty), while seven other cases were diagnosed only by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (n = 7), pending confirmation either by viral genome sequencing or IMH; some of these epizootics originated from areas without any epidemiological evidence of YFV circulation. Interestingly, all these epizootics occurred in marmosets (genus
