<p>To examine the genetic divergence of the RJ155 YFV relative to previous virus samples, we plotted the root-to-tip divergence from the ML tree as a function of sampling time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>A). We found a strong correlation between the divergence and time of sampling (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.94). The RJ155 YFV showed a low deviation from the mean regression line, with residuals comparable with other YFV genomes sampled previously. The RJ155 showed a low mean global nucleotide genetic divergence (
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>nt</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 0.2%) from the ancestral CDS of the YFV
 <sub>RJ-I</sub> lineage. The mean nucleotide synonymous (
 <italic>dS</italic>) distance was much higher than the mean nonsynonymous (
 <italic>dN</italic>) distance in both the structural and non-structural genomic regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>B). The analysis of selective pressure (normalised 
 <italic>dN-dS</italic> along the CDS) showed an overrepresentation of sites accumulating synonymous substitutions. No positively selected codon positions were identified at the entire CDS sequence by the MEME or REL methods, and two sites in the NS5 gene (positions 3017 and 3406) displayed a trend (p-values 0.081 and 0.072, respectively) towards negative selection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>C). These observations support the claim that the evolution of the YFV
 <sub>RJ-I</sub> lineage was mainly driven by genetic drift.
