<p>To assess the spatial spread of the YFV
 <sub>RJ-I</sub> lineage with more precision, we employed a relaxed random walk phylogeographic model with a lognormal distribution, selected as the fittest continuous phylogeographic model [
 <inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="1678-8060-mioc-114-e190076-s.pdf" id="d35e1020" content-type="local-data" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supplementary data</inline-supplementary-material> (Table IV)]. The continuous diffusion inference placed the origin of the YFV
 <sub>RJ-I</sub> lineage in the municipality of Macaé in January 2017 (BCI September 2016-February 2017), from where it rapidly spread throughout the coastal steps of the Serra do Mar mountain chain and the lowlands shared with the neighbouring municipalities of Casimiro de Abreu and Silva Jardim, and the more distant municipality of Guapimirim (

 <sub>RJ-I</sub> lineage covers an extensive area of Atlantic Forest remains situated along the coastal side of Serra do Mar, shared by the municipalities of Macaé, Rio das Ostras, Casimiro de Abreu, Nova Friburgo, and Silva Jardim. This zone is very close to urbanised areas, including the place where the RJ155 was sampled, which is located only two kilometres away from the contiguous urban perimeter of Casimiro de Abreu and Rio das Ostras (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). These results clearly support that the YFV has persisted in the Atlantic Forest area of RJ for three consecutive YFV transmission seasons (2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019).
