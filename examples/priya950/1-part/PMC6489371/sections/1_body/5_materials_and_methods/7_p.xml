 <italic>YFV dataset assembly</italic> - The complete polyprotein open reading frame [complete coding sequence (CDS), 10,239 nt in length] of the genome of the newly generated 2019 YFV from the Casimiro de Abreu municipality was combined with all American YFV sequences available in GenBank on January 2019 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) with known dates and countries of collection, covering at least 99% of the viral CDS, and with an associated publication. The sequences were aligned using MAFFT
