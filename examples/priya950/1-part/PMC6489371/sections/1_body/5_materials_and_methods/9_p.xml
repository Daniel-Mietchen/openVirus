 <italic>Genetic distance and selection analysis</italic> - The ancestral CDS of the node encompassing all YFV sequences from RJ closely related to the 2019 YFV strain was reconstructed by Bayesian inference as described above, and computed using the Geneious 9.1.4 program (https://www.geneious.com). Genetic differences relative to the inferred ancestral CDS were calculated based on the global (
