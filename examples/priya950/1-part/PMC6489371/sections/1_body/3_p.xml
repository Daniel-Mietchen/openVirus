<p>Epizootic surveillance combined with rapid laboratory diagnosis (molecular biology techniques and IMH) has been considered a potential tool for the early detection of the emergence of YFV and assures quick responses; it could also protect the human population by defining the affected areas and areas at risk and intensifying vaccination drives, communication, and appropriate control measures.

 </xref> Simultaneous phylogeographical analyses of circulating viral genomes can also strengthen molecular epidemiology, detect the emergence of new lineages, and define transmission chains and virus dispersion routes, which in turn, may improve the timely establishment of prophylactic and control measures. Nevertheless, the efficient functioning of the epizootic surveillance depends on the support and alerts from a sensitised information network.
