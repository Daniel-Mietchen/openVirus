<p>YFV evolution in fragmented habitats through vertical transmission in the vectors might impose strong bottlenecks to viral diversity. The divergence accumulated in the RJ155 YFV, however, was compatible with the expected mean divergence for YFV, indicating that the substitutions were not accumulated in this strain at a faster rate compared with that in other viral strains. The overrepresentation of negative dN-dS values found in the YFVRJ-I lineage indicates that the vast majority of mutations in these viruses are synonymous and fixed by purifying the selection and/or genetic drift, as previously observed for YFV.

 </xref> Arthropod-borne viruses like YFV are characterised by higher levels of negative selection pressure than RNA viruses transmitted by other routes, which is probably a consequence of a life cycle involving phylogenetically divergent hosts.
