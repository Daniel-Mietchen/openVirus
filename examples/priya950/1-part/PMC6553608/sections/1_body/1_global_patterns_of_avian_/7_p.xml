<p>New HPAI strains are thought to emerge from an LPAI progenitor (see 
 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="RSTB20180257BX1">box 1</xref>) following their introduction into domestic bird populations (e.g. [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]). Since domestic ducks can share the same habitat, water and food as wild waterfowl [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], their presence and concentration are thought to make them key intermediate hosts between wild birds and poultry, and consequently they play an important role in the emergence and circulation of HPAI strains, especially in Asia [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The bridging role of domestic ducks between wild birds and domestic Galliformes has been particularly emphasized in the H7N9 IAV outbreaks in China [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], most notably in areas where high concentrations of free-grazing ducks live in close contact with potentially infected wild birds, such as the Poyang and Dongting Lakes [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Agricultural practices, such as the release of high quantities of juvenile ducks in paddy fields prior to the arrival of the wild birds, might further exacerbate transmission and circulation of the virus between wild and domestic animals.
