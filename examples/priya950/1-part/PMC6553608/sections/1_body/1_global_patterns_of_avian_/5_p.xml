<p>The effect that bird migratory flyways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180257F4">figure 4</xref>) have on the global circulation of IAV can be seen in the phylogeny of all segments, where two very distinct major clades corresponding either to the Americas or to Asia, Europe, Africa and Australasia can be observed [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Estimates of the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of these clades varies by segment and method, but appears to be in the region of 100 years, a value close to the root of the major contemporary human, swine and avian lineages [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and as such represents a deep divide (also evident in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180257F5">figure 5</xref>). Although viral dissemination via wild birds can be thought of as occurring along flyways, different species have different migration patterns, and these general flyways overlap, as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180257F4">figure 4</xref>. Consequently, cross-flyway (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]), and intercontinental transmission of avian IAV by wild birds does occur. In a study of northern pintails, Koehler 
 <italic>et al.</italic> found intercontinental transmission of LPAI connecting the East Asian-Australasian flyway to the Pacific Americas [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], while in 2014/2015 HPAI H5N8 was introduced into North America by a similar route [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. There is also evidence for transfer of IAV genes from the Americas to Eurasia [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>].
