<p>Fortunately, there was no human transmissible H5N1 pandemic in 2009, something that might have caused the deaths of millions (assuming that a human transmissible form retained high pathogenicity). Instead the world was gripped by the much milder 2009 H1N1 ‘swine flu’ pandemic [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Despite mostly mild symptoms in humans, the lack of immunity to this quite different strain from the previously circulating H1N1 seasonal virus meant that a significant fraction of the population had probably been infected. Combining serology studies from 19 countries, an age-adjusted cumulative incidence estimate of just under a quarter (24%) of the population was obtained [
