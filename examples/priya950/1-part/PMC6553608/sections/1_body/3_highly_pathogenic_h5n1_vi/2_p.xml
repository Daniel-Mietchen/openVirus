<p>In 1996, an HPAI H5N1 virus was found in commercial geese in the Guandong Province, China (A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96), which was thought to originate from H5 viruses in wild migratory birds [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], and because of the zoonotic risk, all poultry in Hong Kong were culled in the winter of 1997/1998 [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. This was partially successful in that the ‘HK-97’ lineage of HPAI H5N1 virus became extinct in Hong Kong [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. However, reassorted Gs/Gd-like H5N1 viruses re-appeared in 2001 [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Phylogenetic studies of whole virus genomes revealed that around 1996–2002 several different genotypes of H5N1 arose from reassortment events between the original HPAI H5N1 virus with other LPAI strains circulating in both domestic and wild bird populations [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. By 2003, one genotype (Z) had become dominant [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Associated with these poultry outbreaks, there were also fatal human cases in Vietnam, Thailand and China [
