<p>Influenza viruses are part of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and are negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses with segmented genomes. There are four main influenza virus species: A, B, C and D. Type A viruses are known to infect a wide variety of birds and mammals, while the other species have more restricted host ranges. Influenza A viruses (IAV), including all avian influenza viruses, possess eight separate genomic segments ranging in size between 890 and 2341 nucleotides [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Like other RNA viruses, influenza viruses have a fast mutation rate, typically accumulating two to eight substitutions per 1000 sites per year [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Segmentation further increases the evolutionary speed of the virus by permitting exchange of genes between virus strains that co-infect cells in the same host, a process known as reassortment. The genome segments of IAV encode ten core polypeptides, including: three subunits of a viral polymerase, a nucleoprotein, three transmembrane proteins (haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and the M2 ion channel), a matrix protein M1 and ‘non-structural’ proteins NS1 and NS2/NEP, as well as a virus strain-dependent suite of non-essential accessory proteins [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The HA and NA surface proteins are antigenic, very diverse, encoded on separate segments and split into 18 and 11 subtypes, respectively. Apart from the recently discovered bat-specific H17, H18, N10 and N11 proteins [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], all of the subtypes have been found in avian species, whereas only a subset of the others have been detected in mammals. The other six segments are often considered as encoding the ‘internal’ genes. Although there is continuous global circulation of IAV in humans, due to the connectivity of the population [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the majority of the diversity is in avian species and the reservoir population is avian [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the general global patterns of IAV epidemiology in birds will help elucidate the origins of past pandemics and could help inform predictions about future events.
