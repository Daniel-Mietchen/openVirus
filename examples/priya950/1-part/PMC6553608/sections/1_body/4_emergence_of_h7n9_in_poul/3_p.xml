<p>Between February 2013 and July 2017, there were five seasonal waves of human H7N9 infections [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>], with waves 2â€“5 starting around October and lasting until around June. Up until the fifth wave, the H7N9 viruses found as part of surveillance in live bird markets were LPAI according to HA sequence, and asymptomatic/mild for chickens [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>], but caused a range of symptoms in humans including severe respiratory distress and death [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. However, there were mutations in the HA, including Q226L (using H3 HA numbering), that were associated with increased binding to human sialic-acid receptors and airborne transmission between mammals [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. However, although these viruses were shown to be transmissible in ferret studies [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>], human to human transmission actually remained limited [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>] and most cases were associated with contact with infected poultry or live bird markets [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. To control the disease, live poultry markets in affected central urban areas were closed [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>], and the total number of human cases per wave decreased from wave 2 to wave 4 [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Nevertheless, the virus, asymptomatic or with mild clinical signs for birds, continued to circulate in poultry populations via trade in China, and diversified into several clades [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. The fifth wave (starting September 2016) saw a rapid increase in the number of human cases and geographic expansion out of southern and eastern China despite the surveillance and control measures [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Also during the fifth wave, HPAI versions of H7N9 were detected in chickens and in human cases in December 2016 and January 2017 [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180257C160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>,
