<p>The overall IR or fraction of pools of female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> positive for CHIKV or ZIKV did not differ significantly between years in the four communities, and there were no significant differences between treated and untreated sites for each virus. The lack of significant differences in IRs between viruses in the same locations is concordant with epidemiologic data indicating that the transmission potentials of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>‐borne arboviruses, such as DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV, are similar in the same locations (Funk 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Riou 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Although the results of the present local study cannot be extrapolated to the whole island, the finding of similar IRs for CHIKV and ZIKV may relate to the fact that similar proportions of people (20–25%) were infected with CHIKV in 2014 and ZIKV in 2016 in Puerto Rico (Hills 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The finding of similar IRs across the four communities with and without vector control does not seem to indicate that IRs are reasonable indicators of risk because the density of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was several times higher in untreated areas. It is suggested that a better indicator of risk may be the VI, which is derived by multiplying the proportion of infected mosquitoes/week by mosquito density/trap/week (Jones 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Vector index values were several times higher in the two untreated areas, with values in the range of 20–40 expected infected mosquitoes (per 1000)/trap/week.
