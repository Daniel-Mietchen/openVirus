<p>It is interesting to note that although CHIKV and ZIKV were introduced into Puerto Rico at different times of year, their overall incidences in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were similar. For example, CHIKV was confirmed in May 2014 (Sharp 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), which usually corresponds with the first peak in the rainy season in Puerto Rico (Barrera, 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), but in 2014 that peak in rainfall was practically absent. Subsequently, CHIKV spread rapidly throughout the island and started to fade away after December 2014, when it is typically cooler and drier. The CHIKV epidemic peaked in September 2014 in Puerto Rico during the second and typically greater peak in rainfall. The timing of the epidemic peak coincided with the period during which most CHIKV‐positive pools were observed in the study sites (September–October 2014). Zika virus was first detected in December 2015 and the epidemic peaked in August 2016. This virus was detected early in the study sites (March) and most positive pools were identified during May–July 2016. Clearly, ZIKV had a longer period of circulation than CHIKV throughout 2016 before the advent of the cooler and drier season in December, which corresponds with the boreal winter at higher latitudes and is when most dengue epidemics usually wane (Barrera, 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). However, it should be noted that ZIKV was able to gain a foothold and eventually spread during the drier and cooler season (December 2015 to March 2016). Zika outbreaks in French Polynesia, Colombia and the State of Bahia, Brazil were reported to have taken off during a relatively dry season (He 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The important lesson to be derived from these observations is that a newly invading arbovirus that finds immunologically naïve human populations can establish during interepidemic periods in tropical areas with entrenched populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>.
