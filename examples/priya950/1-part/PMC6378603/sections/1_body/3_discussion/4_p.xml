<p>Comparing IRs in mosquitoes is difficult because of differences in sampling tools, number of samples, and analytic methodologies. Overall IRs of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with CHIKV (7–12 per 1000) and ZIKV (5–19 per 1000) sampled using sentinel AGO traps for 2 weeks in other communities in Puerto Rico (CDC, unpublished data, 2018) were similar to those observed in the present study, although IRs derived from weekly samples at peak transmission were higher in this study (CHIKV, IR = 38; ZIKV, IR = 25). Previous studies have reported CHIKV IRs comparable with those observed here (4–32 per 1000) (Sang

 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Previous reports of ZIKV IRs in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were higher than those observed in this investigation, such as in mosquitoes collected around patients in Mexico (53–172 per 1000) (Guerbois 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) and in mosquitoes collected in Senegal (71 per 1000) (Diallo 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In the present study, DENV IRs were very low (0.15–0.67 per 1000), virus detections were infrequent, and no DENV was detected in 2014 in the same study sites. During the 2010 DENV epidemic in Puerto Rico, a higher IR (26 per 1000) in rural areas was observed (CDC, unpublished data, 2010) and was similar to those reported in Colombia (33 per 1000) (Perez‐Castro 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) and Venezuela (15–17 per 1000) (Urdaneta 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). A study of IRs in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> collected at 100 m around houses with positive or negative dengue cases in Thailand found 13 and 0.6 infected mosquitoes per 1000, respectively (Yoon 
 <italic>et al</italic>.,
