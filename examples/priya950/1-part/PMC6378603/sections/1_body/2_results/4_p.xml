<p>During 2016, 58 pools across all four sites were ZIKV‐positive; 55 of these were sourced from untreated areas. The other three positive pools were found in Villodas and none were found in La Margarita (Table

 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). With respect to CHIKV, the site with the greatest number of mosquitoes also had the largest number of ZIKV‐positive pools (Playa). Overall IRs did not differ significantly between sites (1.2–2.0 ZIKV‐infected mosquitoes/1000 mosquitoes; 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Weekly ZIKV IRs varied widely, reaching maximums of 10, 0, 20 and 25 infected mosquitoes/1000 mosquitoes/week in Arboleda, La Margarita, Playa and Villodas, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Overall IRs of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with CHIKV in 2014 and ZIKV in 2016 did not differ significantly among sites (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), with the exception of La Margarita, where no ZIKV‐positive pools were found. Average VIs were higher in untreated (9 in Arboleda and 30 in Playa) than in treated (0 in La Margarita and 2 in Villodas) sites (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In 2016, ZIKV was detected in mosquitoes as early as March in Arboleda and Villodas, and later in May, with more frequent detections during June and July, in Playa (Figs 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and
