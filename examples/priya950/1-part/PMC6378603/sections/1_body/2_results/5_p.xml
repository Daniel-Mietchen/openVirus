<p>No DENV‐positive mosquito pools were found in 2014, but six were found in 2016. Four positive pools were identified in untreated areas and the other two in La Margarita, a treated site (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).Overall mosquito IRs with DENV (0.15–0.67) were lower than those with CHIKV or ZIKV, but given the small number of occurrences, no statistical comparisons were performed (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Average VIs were also lower for DENV (0.7–2.1). Dengue virus was detected in April 2016 in Playa (three pools), in April and May 2016 in La Margarita (two pools), and in May 2016 in Arboleda (one pool) (Figs
