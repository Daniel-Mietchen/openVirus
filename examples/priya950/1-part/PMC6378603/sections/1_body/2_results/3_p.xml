<p>In 2014, CHIKV‐positive pools of female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> numbered 50 in the untreated sites and five in the treated areas; no positive pools were found in 2016 (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The number of CHIKV‐positive pools was greatest in the neighbourhood with the highest mosquito density (Playa). There were no statistical differences between sites in overall CHIKV IR in samples taken during June–December in 2014 (1.75–2.48 infected mosquitoes/1000 mosquitoes; 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Weekly IR varied widely, reaching maximums of 38, 18, 28 and 32 infected mosquitoes/trap/week/1000 mosquitoes in Arboleda, La Margarita, Playa and Villodas, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The average VI (expected number of infected mosquitoes/trap/week/1000 mosquitoes) was larger in both communities without vector control (24 in Arboleda and 43 in Playa) than in treated areas (3 in each of La Margarita and Villodas) (Table 
 <xref rid="mve12338-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Positive pools of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females were detected in consecutive weeks at untreated sites in October 2014 (Figs 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mve12338-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Some of the results of CHIKV infection in mosquitoes for these study sites have been presented previously (Barrera 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and are shown here to facilitate comparisons with the 2016 ZIKV and DENV results.
