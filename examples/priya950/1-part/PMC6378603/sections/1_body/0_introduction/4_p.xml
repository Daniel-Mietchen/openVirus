<p>The invasions of CHIKV and ZIKV in immunologically naïve human populations also provide opportunities to investigate possible differences in transmission dynamics, such as differences in vector densities and other environmental parameters. Comparisons of epidemics of dengue and Zika concluded that reproduction numbers were similar when data for the same localities were compared, but differed in comparisons of epidemics of the same virus in other localities. Variations in environmental conditions are more important than differences between viruses (Funk

 <italic>et al</italic>.,

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations in different geographical settings (Zouache
