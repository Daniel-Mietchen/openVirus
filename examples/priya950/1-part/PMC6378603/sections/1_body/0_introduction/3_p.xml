<p>Thresholds to prevent urban yellow fever epidemics were established in the past and have been recommended as reference data in strategies to prevent DENV transmission (Brown, 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>). However, a number of studies have reported DENV transmission in contexts in which the Breteau index was below the threshold of five out of 100 houses with at least one container with immature stages of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Bowman 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Studies in Cuba and Taiwan suggested DENV transmission took place when Breteau indices were close to one (of 100 houses) (Sanchez 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Chang 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Unfortunately, indices of the prevalence of immature stages in containers found in houses (e.g. the house, Breteau and container indices) do not generally correlate well with adult mosquito abundances (Focks, 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Additionally, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> uses cryptic aquatic habitats in houses (e.g. septic tanks, inundated roofs and basements, drains) (Barrera 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>, Pilger 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), as well as in public areas (e.g. storm drains, trash in abandoned lots) (Paploski 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Missing important aquatic habitats of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> could lead to underestimations of mosquito prevalence and provide a false sense of security. Monitoring adult densities of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has been difficult in the past because of a lack of practical traps to deal with the complex anthropophilic behaviour of this mosquito (Barrera, 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Newer traps, such as the electro‐mechanic BG‐Sentinel trap (Krockel 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) or passive gravid traps, such as the CDC autocidal gravid ovitrap (AGO trap) (Mackay 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) or the gravid 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> trap (Eiras 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) allow the establishment of programmes for the surveillance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> based on female adults that transmit viruses. Capturing adult 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> using these devices also allows for testing for the presence of arboviruses. The presence of arboviruses in local 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females is indicative of the nearby presence of infected humans as this mosquito does not move far during its lifetime (Reiter, 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) and serves as a proxy for human infections or xenomonitoring (Barrera 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).
