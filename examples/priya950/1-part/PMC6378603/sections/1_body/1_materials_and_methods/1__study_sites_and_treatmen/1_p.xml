<p>Four communities were involved in this investigation, including two communities with vector control (La Margarita, Villodas) and two without vector control (Arboleda, La Playa). La Margarita (17°58′18″ N, 66°18′10″ W; 327 houses) is a neighbourhood in which vector control consisted of source reduction and larvicidal treatments applied at the beginning of a study conducted in December 2011, to which three AGO traps per house in over 80% of houses were subsequently added (Barrera

In Villodas (17°58′13″ N, 66°10′48″ W; 241 houses), for the purposes of comparison, only source reduction and larvicidal treatments were applied in December 2011, but, from February 2013 onwards, the installation of three AGO traps per home in most homes was added to the treatment regime to determine if the number of mosquitoes declined to the low levels observed in La Margarita (Barrera

 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2014b</xref>). In the present study, in order to compare mosquito densities in neighbourhoods without vector control, two nearby communities, Arboleda (17°58′46″ N, 66°17′23″ W; 398 houses) and Playa (17°57′59″ N, 66°18′10″ W; 269 houses) were also studied. La Margarita and Arboleda are middle‐income communities, whereas Playa and Villodas are less affluent and houses have bigger patios. No other mosquito control measures were applied in these areas during the study.
