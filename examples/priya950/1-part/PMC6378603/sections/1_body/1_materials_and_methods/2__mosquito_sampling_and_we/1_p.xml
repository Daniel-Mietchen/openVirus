<p>Female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> sampling was conducted every week in the four study sites during January–December in 2014 and 2016. The AGO traps used for surveillance and control were similar, except that those used for control had a mesh funnel at the entrance of the trap to discourage lizards from entering the capture chamber (Acevedo 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The number of surveillance AGO (SAGO) traps needed to cover a neighbourhood and the number of control traps per home had been determined previously (Mackay 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="mve12338-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The total number of traps used for control purposes depends on the number of householders consenting to participation. Coverage with control traps exceeded 80% in the two communities from the beginning of the study. In total, 44 sentinel SAGO traps and 793 AGO control traps were placed in La Margarita, 27 SAGO and 570 AGO control traps in Villodas, and 30 and 28 SAGO traps (no control traps) in Arboleda and Playa, respectively. The number of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes was recorded every week in each SAGO trap and both types of trap were serviced and the water, hay pack and sticky glue board replaced every 2 months. One meteorological station recording air temperature, rainfall and relative humidity (RH) (HOBO Data Logger; Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA, U.S.A.) was placed in the centre of each of La Margarita, Villodas and Arboleda to collect hourly data during January–December in both years. No meteorological station was placed in Playa because this community was only 200 m away from La Margarita and therefore the data provided by the station in La Margarita were used for both communities.
