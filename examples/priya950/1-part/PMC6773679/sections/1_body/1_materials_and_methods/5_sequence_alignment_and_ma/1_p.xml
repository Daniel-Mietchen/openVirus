<p id="Par9">The hMPV sequences generated in this study were combined with all publicly available hMPV G and F genes sequences with known sampling dates and locations in GenBank. Partial sequences (&lt;80%) of the G and F genes were excluded, and identical sequences collected in the same sampling location on the same date were removed to improve computation time. In total, 978 G gene sequences (568 genogroup-A and 410 genogroup-B) and 767 F gene sequences (365 genogroup-A and 402 genogroup-B) were included in the phylogenetic analysis (Table
