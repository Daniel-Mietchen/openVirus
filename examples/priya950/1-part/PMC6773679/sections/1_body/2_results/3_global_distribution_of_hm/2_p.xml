 </sup>. This cluster was persistent in Asia for more than 10 years, and the transmissions of this cluster of strains from Asia to other continents were observed. More obviously, the young lineage A2c most likely originated around 2001 (1997–2003, 95%HPD) and was well established in Asian countries. Current surveillance data showed A2c was now the major epidemic lineage in genogroup A. A similar pattern was observed for the F gene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The A2c lineage of hMPV was endemic in Asia as the F gene phylogeny and introductions of A2c strains from Asia into other continents were observed after 2010 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In genogroup B, the sequences near the root of the phylogenetic tree were also mainly from America (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Lineages B1 and B2 of hMPV were established in Asian countries after 2010, and thereafter hMPV transmissions between Asia and Europe were frequently observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).
