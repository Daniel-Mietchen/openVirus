<p id="Par13">The hMPV A genogroup can be divided into four lineages (A1, A2a, A2b, A2c) based on the phylogeny topology (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and genetic diversity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). The heat map of identity matrix clearly showed A1 strains were divergent from all A2 lineages (identity less than 85.2%), but similar genetic distances or identities were observed among A2a, A2b, and A2c (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Therefore, A2c was named as a novel A2b lineage in a previous study
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup> but marked as a novel lineage in this study due to the comparable genetic identities between each pair of the A2 sub-lineages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For instances, the pairwise nucleotide identities between strains from A2b and A2c lineages were range from 87.5–93.3% which was similar with that observed between strains from A2a and A2b (86.0–93.3%). Within lineage, the divergent patterns showed by the G genes existed according to the time, seemingly having little correlation with the isolation date (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).
