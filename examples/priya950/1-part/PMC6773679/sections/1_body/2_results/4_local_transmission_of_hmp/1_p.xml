<p id="Par16">The continental-specific distribution was observed for hMPV genetic lineages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Then, the next intriguing question became how hMPV circulated at a country level. In particular, the increasing epidemic of hMPV in Guangzhou in 2017 was caused by the local strains circulating in previous seasons or the strains being imported from another region. The phylogenetic analyses of hMPV strains isolated in Guangzhou 2013–2017 showed the predominant lineage was varied in different years (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Based on the phylogeny of F genes, 26, 1, 15, and 10 strains were classified into A2c, A2b, B1, and B2 lineages, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In 2017, we identified one HMPV A2c strain with 111nt-dup in the G gene (P17072_GD-CHN_110ntDup_2017, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). This strain is closely related with the 111nt-dup hMPV novel variant most recently identified in Japan in 2017

 </sup>. Notably, all these novel variants were scattered in a cluster of A2c lineage, indicating these variants were likely the result of multiple incidences of mutations rather than having evolved from a single mutation strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). In this scenario, the mutation leading to a duplication fragment in the G gene may easily have occurred for hMPV. In Guangzhou, hMPV infections were mainly caused by A2c, B1, and B2 lineage strains and none of the A1 and A2a lineage strains were identified in hMPV infection cases (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Notably, in 2017, B1 lineage strains replaced the A2c and were likely the major causative strains leading to the increasing epidemiology of hMPV infections in Guangzhou (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). To trace the transmission of hMPV, we reconstructed the potential origins of Guangdong hMPV strains based on the phylogeny of the G gene. The hMPV strains isolated in Guangzhou in different years were always closely related (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b,c</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b,c</xref>). However, the contemporary strains from Japan were always clustered together with strains of Guangzhou, highlighting the frequent transmissions among cities in China and Japan. The B1 strains causing the increasing hMPV epidemic in Guangzhou 2017 were more likely imported from Japan since closely related sequences were not found in Guangzhou but in Japan in the previous season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).
