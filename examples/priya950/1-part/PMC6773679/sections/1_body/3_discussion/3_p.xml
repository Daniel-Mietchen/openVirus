 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although the temporal distribution and clinical symptoms of hMPV have been reported, the representative genetic sequences of hMPV in different regions of China are rarely investigated. Therefore, the geographic distributions and the transmission dynamics of hMPV lineages among different regions of China are still little understood. Our genetic description and analysis of hMPV viruses in southern China provide a baseline for future studies of the evolution and molecular epidemiology of this emerging virus in China.
