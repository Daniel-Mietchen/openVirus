<p id="Par20">In summary, our genetic and epidemiological analyses show that hMPV displayed different distribution and transmission patterns before 1990, 1990–2005, and 2006–2017. The firm establishment and continuous evolution of hMPV is observed in Asian countries after 2005, leading to the emergence of novel variants and the global transmission of these variants. In addition, close relations are observed among hMPV strains from China and Japan through the whole phylogenies. Therefore, careful monitoring of hMPV should be conducted throughout Asian countries to illustrate virus circulation in the area and sound an alarm for global hMPV surveillance.</p>
