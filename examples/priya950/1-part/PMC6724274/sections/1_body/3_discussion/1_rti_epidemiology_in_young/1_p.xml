<p id="Par38">Until recently, there were very few data describing RTI frequency, clinical consequences and nature of the virus recovered in young patients (≤ 2 years) with CF using molecular diagnostic tools [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A consortium has been set up between the USA and Australia to precisely evaluate the impact of early respiratory viral infections in young children with CF (NCT01973192). We found that a mean 3.4 RTI episodes occurred in our patients over 1 year; the maximum number of RTIs recorded was seven in one patient. This frequency is in accordance with data reported by Collinson et al. in the late 1990s (3.4 URTIs per year in children under 6 years of age) using cultural or serological tools [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but is half the 3.8 episodes identified using PCR over the 6 winter months reported by van Ewijk et al. in a population of children with CF who were a mean 3.5 years old [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The most recent data published by the Swiss group did not provide a precise RTI frequency calculation because their methodology differed from ours [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The reason for the LRTI frequency reported in our study likely stems from the scoring system itself and the way we used it for the purposes of the study. This so-called “respiratory illness” scoring system was developed by van Ewijk et al. for parents for self-recording of URTI and/or LRTI clinical symptoms. This clinical score was systematically measured twice weekly. In the present study, because of the high risk of errors in filling in the diary or giving up over a longer period of time (12 months vs. 6 in the van Ewijk et al. study), we chose not to use it on a systematic basis, but rather as an aid for both parents and home caregivers to detect RTIs and launch nasal sampling. Furthermore, it appears that some RTI episodes may have been missed using this score, particularly mild URTIs.
