<p id="Par43">This study also has limitations. (1) There were fewer samples in comparison to recent studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. (2) In our hands, despite the presence of healthcare providers at home, the scoring system used to help parents and professional caregivers identify RITs in children was weak and may have missed several mild RTIs. (3) The overall low number of samples in each subgroup make the analysis of some well-known risk factors of RTIs such as daycare attendance or tobacco smoke exposure impossible. (4) The subjects’ median age at inclusion was 6.4 months, which is likely already “too late” to evaluate the clinical impact of some viral RTIs that are known to be more worrisome at the youngest ages (usually before 3 months of age). (5) Finally, healthy controls were not included for comparison purposes.
