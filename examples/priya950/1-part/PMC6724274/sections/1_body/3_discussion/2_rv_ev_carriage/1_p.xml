<p id="Par40">Approximately one-third of the study population carried viruses without any symptoms. RV/EV were recovered in 51% of these cases. The clinical significance of this finding is currently unknown, as are the underlying mechanisms and potential consequences. Whether or not this was the same subtype of picornavirus (RV or EV) was not addressed in this study, but prolonged carriage has been reported [

In a recent study conducted in a mean of 3.5 years old (range, 0–17 years) CF patients population sampled weekly for 6 months, the authors found that patients with CF had a more frequent and prolonged carriage of RV in comparison to their healthy counterparts, even if the subtypes did not differ [

The authors conclude that “this may indicate increased viral replication and/or decreased viral antiviral defense in patients with CF.” In younger patients (included within their first 3 months of life), Korten et al. found that RV without symptoms was detected in 20% of cases and that virus detection was less frequently associated with symptoms in comparison to healthy infants. This raises the question of the pathogenicity of these viruses in young patients with CF.
