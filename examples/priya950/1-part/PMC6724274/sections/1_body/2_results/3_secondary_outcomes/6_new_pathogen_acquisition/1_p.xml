<p id="Par37">Four percent of the patients were positive for PA and 32% for SA at inclusion. A mean 5.6 ± 1.5 swabs were taken during the scheduled visit at the center for bacterial analysis. During the study, new isolation of PA occurred in five patients (5/24; 21%) and in ten patients (10/17; 59%) for SA. It is noteworthy that while none of our participants had 
 <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> (SM) at inclusion, four acquired this bacterium during the study period. The small number of patients in each subgroup precluded further statistical analysis. However, there was a trend for a higher number of total RTIs in patients with new isolations of PA, and the same was noticed for SM (Table
