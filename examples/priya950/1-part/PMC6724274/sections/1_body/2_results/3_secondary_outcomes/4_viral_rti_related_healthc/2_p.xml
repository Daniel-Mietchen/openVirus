<p id="Par34">Supplemental medications were needed in the vast majority of viral RTIs: oral antibiotics were prescribed at least once in 22 patients (88%) for a mean length of 13.8 ± 6.2 days and a mean cumulative number of days of 28.9 ± 21 days. Oral steroids were used in five patients (21%) for a mean length of 4.4 ± 1.4 days because of prolonged or recurrent wheezing spells, and bronchodilators were used in four (18%) for a mean length of 4.5 ± 7.8 days. A significant correlation was found between the total number of RTIs (virally proven or not) and the cumulative number of days under antibiotics used during the year of follow-up (Pearson correlation,
