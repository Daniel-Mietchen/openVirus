<p>The severe clinical presentations of dengue fever cases during this outbreak seems to suggest a lack of previous exposure, but it could also be attributed to the co-circulation of two serotypes of dengue virus 1 and 3, since a secondary infection with a different serotype of the virus is a risk factor for developing severe disease [
 <xref rid="B1-tropicalmed-04-00043" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Our limited serotype analysis showed both DENV-1 and -3 in the area and did not exclude others, even though DENV-2 has been recently identified in Kassala state, East Sudan [

The notably high negative results could be due to collection of the blood samples before the development of a detectable immune response (antibodies). The protocol of the Sudan National Public Health Laboratory is to use serological tests to screen the blood samples for infections, followed by using RT-PCR assays to confirm the serologically positive cases [

The high mortality rate in the first weeks of the outbreak might be attributed to the start of treatment before confirmation of DENV infection. Most of these cases were treated as severe malaria cases, which is a common confusion in resource-limited settings [
