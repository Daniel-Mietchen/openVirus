<p>Frozen biting midge and mosquito tissues were homogenized for 2 min at maximum speed in the Bullet Blender Storm (Next advance), centrifuged for 30 seconds at 14,500 rpm in the Eppendorf minispin plus (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and suspended in 100 μl of fully supplemented HEPES-DMEM medium. Samples were blended again for 2 min at maximum speed, and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,500 rpm. Mosquito saliva samples were thawed at RT and vortexed before further use. In total 30 μl of each body or saliva sample was inoculated on a monolayer of Vero E6 cells in a 96 wells plate. After 2–3 h the inoculum was removed and replaced by 100 μl of fully supplemented HEPES-DMEM medium. Wells were scored for virus induced CPE at 3 and 7 days post inoculation. Virus titers of infected biting midge bodies and heads, as well as mosquito bodies and saliva were determined with EPDA on Vero E6 cells [
