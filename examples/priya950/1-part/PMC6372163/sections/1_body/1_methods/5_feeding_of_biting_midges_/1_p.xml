 <italic>pipiens</italic> mosquitoes were kept on water for 3 days, whereas the other species were maintained on 6% glucose solution until being offered an infectious blood meal. SHUV P3 stock with a mean titer of 3.0 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml was mixed 1:1 with cow blood. The used cow blood was tested negative for Schmallenberg virus (SBV) antibodies, to prevent cross-neutralisation with SHUV. The infectious blood meal was provided through Parafilm M membrane using the Hemotek PS5 feeding system, under dark conditions at 24°C and 70% relative humidity. After 1 h, insects were anesthetized with 100% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and kept on a CO
 <sub>2</sub>-pad to select fully engorged females. For each species, five fully engorged females were directly stored at -80°C for each replicate. These samples were used to determine the ingested amounts of SHUV for each species. All remaining and fully engorged females were placed back into buckets with a maximum group size of 110 individuals per species per bucket. All insects were provided with 6% glucose solution
