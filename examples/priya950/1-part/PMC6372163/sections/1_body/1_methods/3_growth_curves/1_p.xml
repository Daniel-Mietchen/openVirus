<p>Cells were seeded in T25 cell culture flasks at densities of 7.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> (Vero E6), 1.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> (C6/36) or 2.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> (KC cells) per flask in 10 ml complete medium. After overnight incubation, the flasks were inoculated with SHUV at an MOI of 0.01 (P4 stock). The MOI calculation for each cell line was based on the virus titer that was determined on Vero E6 cells. One hour after inoculation, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. At time points 0 (sample taken directly after medium replacement), 24, 48 and 72 h post infection, 200 μl samples were taken and stored at -80°C for later analysis. Virus titers were determined by EPDA using Vero E6 cells [
