<p>Recent outbreaks of SBV and BTV showed the tremendous impact of midge-borne viruses on animal health [

 <italic>nubeculosus</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>sonorensis</italic>), which illustrates its potential for emergence. SHUV should therefore be considered as an important arbovirus which may emerge further internationally in the near future. Future studies should test vector competence of field-collected 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species for SHUV, to more accurately predict the efficiency of SHUV transmission following a first introduction into currently free areas. In addition, we recommend the development of diagnostic assays and a vaccine. These actions are essential to be prepared for newly emerging arboviruses with zoonotic potential such as SHUV.
