<p>The very low infection rates of mosquitoes triggered further investigation into potential mosquito barriers against SHUV infection. To this end,

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were intrathoracically injected with SHUV, to bypass the potential midgut barrier. Direct injection of SHUV into the thorax resulted in high infection rates of 68% for
