<p id="p0010">In 2008, 1.8 million children under 5 years of age died from ALRTI, accounting for 17% of all deaths among children in this age group. The majority (98%) of these preventable deaths occurred in developing countries 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Pneumonia dominates the causes of death of children under 5 years of age 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Acute respiratory infections are also associated with high morbidity. The incidence is estimated at 0.29 cases per child per year in developing countries, or about 151 million new ALRTI cases each year in developing countries. Among these ALRTI, acute viral bronchiolitis remains a major public health problem, affecting millions of children every year. Many viruses are involved and responsible for clinical pictures of variable severity. Knowledge of the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections is becoming increasingly clear because previously unidentified new viruses are being isolated.
