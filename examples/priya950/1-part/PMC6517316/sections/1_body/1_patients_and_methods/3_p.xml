<p id="p0035">We sought to identify the viruses responsible for ALRTI. All children hospitalized during this period were systematically sampled by nasal or nasopharyngeal aspiration for the following respiratory viruses: influenza virus, RSV, coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3. The sample was taken at the time of hospitalization and stored at 4°C until it was sent to the influenza and respiratory virus laboratory of the Pasteur Institute in Sidi Fredj. Each swab was collected and placed in a tube containing 2 mL of virus transport medium (Becton Dickinson, USA). All samples were tested by real-time PCR and conventional PCR. An aliquot of 450 μL was tested for the presence of the influenza virus, then for RSV and HMPV. Another aliquot was used for conventional multiplex PCR for rhinovirus, coronavirus (OC43, 229E) and parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3. The rest of the sample was stored at −80°C for 1 year. The virus identification techniques used are provided in
