<p id="p0030">The study population was composed of children aged 15 days to 24 months with an ALRTI that required hospitalization in the pzaediatric department. Infants younger than 15 days old and children older than 2 years were excluded from the study. Acuteness of infection was defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms for less than 2 weeks. ALRTI is diagnosed in the presence of fever or hypothermia associated with at least one of the following symptoms: polypnoea, wheezing, abnormalities in pulmonary listening or friction. Hospitalization criteria are based on the presence of at least one of the following signs: rapid breathing (&gt;60 breaths per minute), chest recession, cyanosis, disturbance of consciousness and eating disorders. Respiratory distress was considered as mild, moderate or severe depending on the intensity of the following parameters: respiratory rate, labored breathing, cyanosis, wheezing or crackles. Associated risk factors (very young age, prematurity) or comorbidity (heart disease, neuromuscular disease, severe malnutrition) may have constituted hospitalization criteria.</p>
