<p id="p0135">Since the first identification of HRV in 1953, about 100 serotypes have been described, and others still appear, reflecting the high variability of this virus. This variability gives a definite advantage to molecular biology techniques versus cell culture 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, which made it possible to highlight the serotypes in this study. HRV group A and B are the most common groups. HRV group C seems to be responsible for more severe clinical forms 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The incidence of HRV in ALRTI in young children has never been studied in Algeria. In our study, HRV was isolated in 23% of children. The average age of the children was 5 months. The clinical picture was not different between HRV-positive and HRV-negative children, or with children in the overall study sample. Smuts etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> found HRV in 58% of young South African children evaluated for wheezing and concluded that HRV is the first viral agent at this age in these children. They did not note a clinical difference between the HRV-positive and HRV-negative groups.
