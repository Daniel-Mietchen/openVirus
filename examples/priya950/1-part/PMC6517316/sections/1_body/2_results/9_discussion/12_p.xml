<p id="p0155">Bezerra et al. 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> obtained a particularly high rate of virus coinfection (39.6%); only one pathogen was identified in 46% of cases. Few studies have examined the correlation between virus coinfection and the clinical severity of ALRTI, and the results are contradictory. Semple et al. 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and Greensill et al. 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> showed that HMPV and RSV coinfections correlate with the severity of clinical signs. Bezerra et al. 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> did not find a correlation between the severity of respiratory infection and bacterial coinfection. We did not analyse this correlation in our sample because of the small number of people coinfected with RSV/HMPV or RSV/HRV.
