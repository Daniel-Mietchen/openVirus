<p id="p0120">In our overall sample of children aged 15 days to 2 years, the average age of infants was 4.6 months, and 90% of them were younger than 12 months. RSV was responsible for respiratory infection in 47.9% of children. This rate is comparable to what has already been reported in other studies using the same method for detecting viruses by real-time PCR, with rates described as ranging from 44% to 49%
