 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. RSV type B was found to be the most common in our study; some publications have shown that group A was associated with more severe forms of bronchiolitis, which is not the case here. RSV was identified in 3-month-old infants in an average of 84.2% of cases; average age was under 6 months. Children infected with RSV are younger than those not infected with RSV at 3.1 months versus 5.9 months. Young age is identified as the main risk factor for severe bronchiolitis
