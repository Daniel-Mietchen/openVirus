<p id="p0170">This study confirms the necessity of identifying the virus to determine the local epidemiology of viral ALRTI. This knowledge is essential to predict epidemics, organize healthcare structures and plan prevention measures for groups at risk. The organization of health monitoring networks for viral ALRTI, as is the case for influenza, would make it possible to optimize the quality of care, and to better organize hospitalization and collaboration between hospital paediatricians and city paediatricians in order to reduce the use of hospital emergency services. This study was performed over a long period during the winter and spring of 2011â€“2012 and will need to be expanded to confirm and refine these initial observations. This study may also provide a starting point for other studies, particularly those searching for risk factors for diseases such as asthma, because certain viral infections have been implicated in the genesis of this prevalent disease.</p>
