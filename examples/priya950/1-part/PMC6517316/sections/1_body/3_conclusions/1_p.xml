<p id="p0165">This study describes for the first time in our country the simultaneous detection of several respiratory viruses in children under 2 years of age hospitalized for ALRTI. We found a high incidence of virus infections in ALRTI. RSV is the most frequently identified viral agent, particularly in infants under 6 months of age. For the first time in Algeria, this study identified emerging viruses, highlighted the high incidence of HRV and HMPV, and emphasized the important role these two viruses play as a frequent reason to seek care. The identification of viruses in ALRTI may help avoid the misuse of antibiotics.</p>
