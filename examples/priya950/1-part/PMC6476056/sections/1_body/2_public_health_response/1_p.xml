<p>On August 3, 2018, a PHSKC disease intervention specialist identified epidemiologic links among patients 5, 6, and 7. Four days later, the health department issued an alert to medical and social service providers concerning the cluster and the increase in HIV diagnoses among persons who inject drugs and who are living homeless. The HIV/Sexually Transmitted Diseases program also contacted several local EDs and the hospital closest to where the patients lived. These EDs have asked providers to increase screening of persons who inject drugs and persons who are living homeless, and at least three are developing more systematic, risk-based opt-out HIV screening programs. To date, ED screening has identified one case of HIV infection (patient 11). On August 20, the King County Jail expanded HIV testing, including opt-out testing at health assessments at 10â€“14 days and, when resources permit, at time of jail booking. This effort has identified one new case of HIV infection, which has not been linked to the cluster. PHSKC also initiated an expanded program of outreach testing, condom distribution, and syringe services among persons living homeless in north Seattle. As of November 15, 2018, that initiative had tested 534 persons and identified four related cases of HIV infection (patients 8, 9, 12, and 14).</p>
