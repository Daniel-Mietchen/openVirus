<p>The occurrence of a large HIV outbreak in Indiana in 2014–2015 (
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>) highlighted the vulnerability of rural communities with few HIV prevention and medical services to HIV outbreaks among persons who inject drugs. Subsequent CDC analyses sought to identify the 5% of U.S. counties with the highest risk for HIV and hepatitis C virus outbreaks among persons who inject drugs (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>). King County, Washington, was not among those highest-risk counties. PHSKC estimates that 93% of county residents with HIV infection know their HIV status and that 85% of persons with diagnosed infection were virally suppressed in 2017 (&lt;200 copies of HIV RNA/mL of blood) (

PHSKC SSPs provided &gt;7 million syringes to persons who inject drugs in 2017; 79% of persons who inject drugs report using SSPs, and syringe sharing among persons who inject drugs has declined over time (
