<p>The magnitude of problem is revealed by the analysis of data reported by the Department of Epidemiological Surveillance of Fortaleza, the fifth largest city in Brazil (capital of Ceará state) that had a chikungunya epidemic in 2016–2017 (80,000 cases), recording the highest number of chikungunya-related deaths in the Americas (169 deaths), with a median age of death of 78 years. The Epidemiological Bulletin released by the Fortaleza Health Secretariat (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007575.g001">Fig 1</xref>) reported a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6% among those between 60–79 years (70/11,457), and approximately 4% for those older than 80 (75/1,771), similar to the CFR estimated by one of the studies that investigated excess mortality during chikungunya epidemics [

On the one hand, chikungunya deaths caused primarily by acute CHIKV infection with direct impairment of organs (hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis/pericarditis, nephritis) are likely to occur in the acute phase, in a similar mechanism to what has been observed in some fatal cases of dengue [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007575.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. On the other hand, deaths following longer clinical courses (post-acute and chronic stages) would be associated with gradual decompensation of comorbidities and long-term hospitalizations that could eventually culminate in nosocomial infections [
