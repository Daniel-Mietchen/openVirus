<p>Despite the need for further studies to establish a definite causal link between CHIKV and mortality, current evidence suggest that chikungunya may be the vector-borne disease associated with the highest number of deaths in the shortest time in the Americas. Nevertheless, until now, neither the World Health Organization nor PAHO have issued an alert for the lethality of the disease. Currently, most clinical protocols to manage chikungunya cases are focused on acute or chronic joint pain relief. Treatment of severe or atypical cases mainly recommend hospitalization in intensive care units for symptomatic treatment and compensation of altered vital functions. While relieving painful symptoms is critical to the quality of life of most patients, intermittent symptomatic treatment, without adequate individual follow-up, does not appear to have an effect on mortality reduction. Moreover, deaths can happen in very few days following onset of symptoms.</p>
