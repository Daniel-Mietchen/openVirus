<p>Critical reasons for death underreporting include incipient epidemiological surveillance systems, the scarcity of human and laboratory resources, and limited health network infrastructure [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007575.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, some aspects of the clinical course of chikungunya contribute to death underreporting, such as (i) the fatal association of chikungunya with the decompensation of comorbidities leads to death certificates that only list prior conditions or the immediate cause of death; (ii) severe cases that require long-term hospitalization may result in a fatal nosocomial infection, which is then reported as the cause of death; and (iii) children without atypical clinical manifestations, especially small infants who cannot adequately express their symptoms, are less likely to have a diagnosis of acute chikungunya. Also, chikungunya-related deaths occur at different stages of the disease (as opposed to dengue, when a death often occurs within the first 10 days [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007575.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]), and most of the fatal victims are older than 75 years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007575.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007575.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]â€”elderly deaths are usually considered as inevitable events, do not trigger media attention or widespread commotion, and rarely are followed by a rigorous investigation, contrary to what can happen when victims are young.
