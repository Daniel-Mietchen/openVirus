<p>ZIKV infection in epidermal keratinocytes caused the appearance of cytoplasmic vacuolation, and the presence of pyknotic nuclei in the stratum granulosum, which is indicative of apoptotic cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0172">172</xref>]. The South Pacific epidemic strain of ZIKV (PF-25,013â€“18) can replicate in A549 cells. This infection enhanced Type-I IFNs, ISGs, pro-inflammatory cytokines and delayed mitochondrial apoptosis [
 <xref rid="CIT0220">220</xref>]. ZIKV, which infects neural progenitor cells in organoid and neurosphere models, activates Toll-like receptor 3 which triggers apoptosis and attenuates neurogenesis [

 <xref rid="CIT0222">222</xref>]. Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a neglected flavivirus. Its epidemic strain, CbaAr-4005, was studied and the results indicated probable entrance of SLEV to the CNS from the circulatory system. Thus, severe disorders could be induced by this infection within the CNS of infected mice. Neuropathogenesis induced by SLEV in mice was screened using different types of neuronal degeneration, and a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in infected mice compared to uninfected ones was confirmed [
