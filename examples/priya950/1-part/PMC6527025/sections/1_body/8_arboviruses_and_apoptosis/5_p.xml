 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> replication is extensively linked to apoptosis. Bluetongue Virus (BTV), a member of this family, induces apoptosis in three studied mammalian cell lines (HeLa (human cervical epithelial carcinoma), BSR (baby hamster kidney), and HEK293T) but not in insect cell lines. Apoptosis induced by BTV involved activation of NF-kB, which required virus uncoating and exposure to outer capsid proteins VP2 and VP5 (
