<p>The replication of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), (family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>), is associated with the extracellular pathway of apoptosis. Up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (i.e. Bax and HRK) and novel components of the ER stress-induced apoptotic pathways (i.e. PUMA and Noxa) have been shown in a CCHFV-infected hepatocyte cell line, which suggests a link between CCHFV replication, apoptosis and ER stress (
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, the differential high levels of CHOP, a transcription factor which is activated through ER stress, are present in hepatocyte cells following CCHFV replication [

 <xref rid="CIT0192">192</xref>]. A proteomic analysis of CHIKV-infected astrocytic cells provided a comprehensive spectrum of modulated host proteins. This study showed that Nucleophosmin (NPM1)/B23, a nucleolar multifunctional chaperone, plays a critical role in restricting CHIKV replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0193">193</xref>]. Studies of mouse models comparing the East Central South African (ECSA) and Asian strains of CHIKV have shown that both strains can spread to astrocytes and neurons; however, studies with the Asian strain showed increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes and higher mortality [
