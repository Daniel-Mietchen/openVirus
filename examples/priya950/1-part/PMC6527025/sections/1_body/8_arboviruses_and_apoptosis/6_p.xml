<p>A histopathological analysis has reported DENV-2 infection in livers of BALB/c mice. Necrosis and apoptosis were clearly noticed as cytopathic effects of DENV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0217">217</xref>]. The ability to induce apoptosis following targeted splicing of viral genomes is an important advantage of this antiviral approach. Carter and colleagues devised a unique configuration of anti-CHIKV/DENV dual targeting group I intron, which catalyzes trans-splicing of the 5ʹ conserved target sequences of the DENV and CHIKV genomes to a 3ʹΔN Bax exon, to effectively induce apoptotic cell death in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36 cells following infection, thus preventing viral spread [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> using transgenic mosquitoes which were generated using Class II TE mariner MosI. They targeted the conserved DENV and CHIKV sequences, which then could lead to viral RNA trans-splicing and cell apoptosis [
