<p>Optimal cytokine levels exert protective effects against IAV replication [

 <xref rid="CIT0241">241</xref>]. Pan and colleagues reported that after H5N1 infection, NF-
 <sub>k</sub>B signaling-induced autophagosome formation was activated in both human lung epithelial cell lines and in mouse lung tissues [
 <xref rid="CIT0264">264</xref>]. The positive feedback between autophagy and NF-
 <sub>k</sub>B and p38 MAPK signaling cascades could be an important mechanism contributing to H5N1-induced lung inflammation [
 <xref rid="CIT0264">264</xref>]. Ectopic P-granule autophagy protein five homolog (EPG5), which is essential for basal autophagy and ATG gene complex functions in the formation of degradative autolysosomes, regulates basal expression of multiple cytokines in the lung [
 <xref rid="CIT0266">266</xref>]. It was also reported that induction of autophagy by IAV infection reduces interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in infected cells by limiting IFN-Î² expression, which may benefit viral replication and spread (
