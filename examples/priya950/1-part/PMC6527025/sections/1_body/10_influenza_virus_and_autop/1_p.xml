<p>The autophagy pathway is involved in IAV replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0124">124</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0239">239</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0241">241</xref>]. It was suggested that the induction of autophagosome degradation during IAV infections might restrict virus replication within infected cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0242">242</xref>]. This could be considered an immune mechanism as well, which impairs or restricts IAV replication and virulence [
 <xref rid="CIT0243">243</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0246">246</xref>]. IAV infection inhibited autophagy at the stage of autophagosome/lysosome fusion, which led to the accumulation of autophagosomes in A549 cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0124">124</xref>] and evasion of viral antigen presentation [
 <xref rid="CIT0124">124</xref>,
