<p>Apoptosis (programmed cell death I) plays a crucial role in a wide variety of physiological processes. During fetal development, and in the course of development of an organism into a mature adult, many cells are produced in excess and these will eventually undergo programmed cell death as complete and mature organs and tissues are formed. As a whole, apoptosis plays a crucial role in the development of, and in maintaining the equilibrium of the body [

 <xref rid="CIT0047">47</xref>]. Apoptosis also plays an important role in the proper development of the immune system. For example, in the process of T-cell proliferation, only matured cells are positively selected, but immature cells are removed by the process of apoptosis [

 <xref rid="CIT0050">50</xref>]. A defect in the apoptosis program, or deregulation of the apoptotic process, results in cancer, autoimmune diseases and spreading of viral infections [
 <xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>]. Excessive apoptosis could lead to the development or enhancement of neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic diseases (stroke, myocardial infraction) and AIDS [
 <xref rid="CIT0051">51</xref>]. Due to the importance of programmed cell death in various biological processes, this phenomenon has been widely studied in mammals, insects [
 <xref rid="CIT0052">52</xref>], cnidarians [
 <xref rid="CIT0053">53</xref>] and nematodes [
 <xref rid="CIT0054">54</xref>]. It has been shown that even plants [
 <xref rid="CIT0055">55</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="CIT0057">57</xref>] and monocellular organisms like yeast [
 <xref rid="CIT0058">58</xref>] also can undergo apoptosis.
