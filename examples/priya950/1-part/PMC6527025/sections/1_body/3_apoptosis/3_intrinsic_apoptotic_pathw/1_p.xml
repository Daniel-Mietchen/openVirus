<p>The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is tightly regulated by the Bcl-2 gene family of proteins. These proteins control the release of specific caspase activating factors from the mitochondria. The Bcl-2 family is divided into various subsets depending upon Bcl-2 homology (BH) motifs. There are proteins that contain a single BH motif; these include Bid, Bad, Bik, Buff, Bid, PUMA, and NOXA [

 <xref rid="CIT0042">42</xref>]. Proteins such as Box, Bok and Back contain three BH domains and Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins contain four BH domains [

This pathway is associated with the disruption of mitochondrial outer membrane potential (MOMP) and eventually leads to the activation of caspase-9. The caspase-9 activating platform contains APAF1 and cytochrome C. These intracellular signals, in turn, activate Bax and Bak, which help in the formation of pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane which disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential and causes the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondrial inner membrane. The released cytochrome C forms a complex with APAF1 and leads to the activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 activation, in turn, activates other executioner caspases eventually leading to apoptotic cell demise [
