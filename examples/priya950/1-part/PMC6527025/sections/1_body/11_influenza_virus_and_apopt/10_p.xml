<p>To screen some host proteins required for secondary bacterial infection after H9N2 virus infection, Ma et al. used iTRAQ proteomics coupled with nano-LC–MS/MS technology. They noticed the differentially higher expression of proteins in host cellular pathways including apoptosis, such as apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 [
 <xref rid="CIT0310">310</xref>]. Other proteomic screens of IAV-infected A549 [
 <xref rid="CIT0311">311</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0313">313</xref>] and of primary human bronchial airway cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0314">314</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0315">315</xref>] also highlighted dysregulated apoptotic (and other) proteins.
