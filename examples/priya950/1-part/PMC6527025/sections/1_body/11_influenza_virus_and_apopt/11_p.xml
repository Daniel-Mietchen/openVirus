<p>Additional studies examined the role of P53 in influenza infection, and apoptosis induction via attenuation of host ubiquitin ligase RING finger protein 43 (RNF43) [
 <xref rid="CIT0316">316</xref>]. IFITM proteins also were inhibited [
 <xref rid="CIT0317">317</xref>], which could be attractive antiviral targets. The molecular mechanisms of selenium nanoparticles, modified on their surfaces by amantadine (Se@AM), and their effects on IAV infection, demonstrated caspase-3 inhibition and a decrease in the level of ROS to trigger AKT pathways. These are additional promising antiviral targets against H1N1 IAV [
 <xref rid="CIT0317">317</xref>]. The interaction of influenza A virus with the host apoptosis pathway is illustrated in 
 <xref rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> and a summary of apoptosis and influenza virus infection is summarized in 
 <xref rid="T0005">Table 5</xref>.
