<p>Studies also have used targeted mutagenesis of viral and host proteins to further assess the role of apoptosis in IAV infection. Su et al. demonstrated that M2-K78R mutant viruses (a ubiquitination-defective mutation in viral M2) induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells more than wild-type (WT) viruses. They concluded that this mutation enhances early and late apoptosis which led to more cell death [

This enzyme mediates the addition of the terminal fucose of sLex to PSGL-1 on CD4 + T cells, which is required for the generation of functional memory CD4 + T cells. Greater cell death was observed in Fut4/7
 <sup>−/-</sup> mutant than in WT cells at 8 dpi by measuring the levels of cleaved caspase-3, together with propidium iodide staining. These data highlight that expression of fucosyltransferase genes in CD4+ effector responses to IAV infection plays a role in maintaining their survival [

 <sup>C</sup>-null mice (Prnp°
 <sup>/0</sup>) were more highly susceptible to IAV than were WT mice [

 <sup>C</sup> is the cellular membrane normal form of the PrP
 <sup>Sc</sup> prion glycoprotein. Prnp°
 <sup>/0</sup> mice showed higher apoptosis levels through activated caspase-3. They suggested PrP
 <sup>C</sup> might exert its protective anti-apoptotic activity by disturbing oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, and not by directly affecting viral replication in lungs [
