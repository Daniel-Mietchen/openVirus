<p>The study conducted by Lee et al. confirmed the onset of apoptosis at early phases of infection. They also showed the switch from apoptosis to pyroptosis (cell death pathway) in normal or precancerous human bronchial epithelial cells under the regulation of type I IFN signaling to initiate pro-inflammatory responses against IAV infection [
