<p>A study conducted by Stawowczyk and colleagues showed that duck AvIFIT protein might be related to the induction of cell apoptosis, similar to human IFIT2 [
 <xref rid="CIT0304">304</xref>]. Another study found duck AvIFIT protein played a critical role in host immune response to H5N1. This was mediated by AvIFIT binding influenza NP protein, which increased the expression of IRF1, IRF7, IFNa, IFNb, TNFa, NF-
 <sub>k</sub>B and IL-12, which in turn magnified IFN signaling and arrested cell growth [
