<p>Different IAV-induced caspase activities also were studied. Stasakova et al. showed the role of IAV NS1 protein to provoke caspase-1 activation in primary human macrophages, resulting in fast apoptosis and release of high levels of interleukins 1b and 18. These results were confirmed by a PKR inhibitor [
 <xref rid="CIT0289">289</xref>]. Influenza virus NS1 protein interacts with β-tubulin, which arrests the infected cells in G2/M phase and affects Bcl-2 phosphorylation [
 <xref rid="CIT0290">290</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0291">291</xref>]. This, in turn, activates NF-
 <sub>k</sub>B and induces INF-α and INF-β [
 <xref rid="CIT0292">292</xref>], which then induce the apoptosis cascade by induction of SOCS-3 expression [
 <xref rid="CIT0293">293</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0294">294</xref>]. Shiozaki et al., showed the cellular pro-apoptotic protein Siva-1 in A549 cells was involved in IAV replication through caspase activation [
 <xref rid="CIT0295">295</xref>]. Another study showed that apoptosis induction in IAV-infected A549 cells correlates with NP expression through the intrinsic pathway. They used the A/California/07/2009(H1N1) strain, which lacks a functional PB1-F2 protein (proapoptotic factor). Clusterin, a host protein, attenuates IAV NP-induced apoptosis and IAV replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0296">296</xref>]. Yang et al. demonstrated that 2009 pandemic H1N1 A/Beijing/501/2009 could induce caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in the A549 cell line [
 <xref rid="CIT0292">292</xref>]. Husain and Harrod showed that caspase-3-mediated histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) cleavage in IAV-infected MDCK cells caused further damage in these cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0297">297</xref>]. In general, caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation serve as indicators of early and late apoptosis, respectively.
