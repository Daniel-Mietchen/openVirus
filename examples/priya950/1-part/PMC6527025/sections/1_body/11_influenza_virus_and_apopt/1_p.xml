<p>Several studies have highlighted the importance of apoptosis induced by IAV in different models. These include using A/PR/8/34 H1N1 [

 <xref rid="CIT0277">277</xref>], or A/New York/55/2004 (H3N2) (NY55), A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8), and 2009 pandemic swine origin influenza virus (SOIV) (A/California/07/2009) [

PR8-induced caspase-7,-3,-9 activation in MEF cells coincided with both the cleavage of PARP-1, a distal event in apoptosis signaling, as well as the truncation of BID, a specific substrate of caspase-8 in the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. The alteration of Bax and Bak levels caused an increase in the ratio of pro-apoptotic (Bax and Bak) proteins to anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) protein (
