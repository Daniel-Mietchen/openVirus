<p>Thus, specific virus-induced UPR pathway usage depends on the type of viral strain. Even the use of ectopically expressed arbovirus NS proteins alone in mammalian cells could elicit the UPR response. TBEV triggers eIF2Î± phosphorylation, but the kinase responsible for this process is not yet known. The stress granule component TIA-1 binds TBEV RNA which is recruited to perinuclear sites of viral replication to inhibit viral translation [

 <xref rid="CIT0237">237</xref>]. These pathways contribute to the inhibition of IFN signaling mediated by STAT1 phosphorylation [
 <xref rid="CIT0230">230</xref>]. After VEEV infection of U87MG cells, the UPR PERK arm was activated, and the expression of both ATF4 and CHOP (DDIT3), critical regulators of the pathway, was altered. The expression of the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR1) was also induced in a PERK-dependent manner. EGR1 contributed to VEEV-induced cell death by modulating proapoptotic pathways [
