<p>WNV activates multiple UPR pathways which cause activation of several UPR target genes [
 <xref rid="CIT0200">200</xref>]. The XBP1 pathway was shown not necessary for WNV replication; however, ATF6 was degraded by the proteasome and the PERK pathway transiently phosphorylated eIF2α and induced the pro-apoptotic protein CHOP (
 <xref rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>) [
 <xref rid="CIT0200">200</xref>]. Cells infected with WNV showed signs of apoptosis including induction of growth arrest and activation of caspase-3 and PARP. The WNV titer was also significantly increased in a CHOP
 <sup>−/-</sup> deficient MEF cell line but not in wild type MEF cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0200">200</xref>]. The host mechanism to counteract WNV infection involved activation of CHOP-dependent cell death [
 <xref rid="CIT0200">200</xref>]. The evidence confirmed the activation of UPR in WNV infection via ATF6/IRE1 pathways [
 <xref rid="CIT0200">200</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0229">229</xref>]. However, there was no significant phosphorylation of eIF2α, indicating that the UPR PERK pathway was not activated [
 <xref rid="CIT0229">229</xref>]. The WNV Kunjin strain NS4A and NA4B proteins were recognized as potent inducers of UPR. Moreover, sequential removal of NS4A hydrophobic domains decreased UPR activation but increased IFN-γ-mediated signaling in Vero C1008 cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0229">229</xref>]. These results showed that hydrophobic residues of WNV Kunjin strain NS proteins activate UPR signaling. The results from the same study group showed that ATF6 signaling is required for WNV replication by promoting cell survival and innate immune response inhibition [
 <xref rid="CIT0230">230</xref>]. The ATF6-deficient cells showed a decrease in WNV Kunjin strain protein and virion production. These cells also demonstrated increased eIF2α phosphorylation and CHOP transcription, which was absent in infected control cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0230">230</xref>]. In contrast, upon infection with WNV, IREI-deficient cells did not show any distinct differences as compared to IREI-positive cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0230">230</xref>]. The results also indicated the essential role of ATF6 for viral replication. In the absence of ATF6, other UPR signaling cascades such as the PERK and IRE1 pathways could not activate or enhance virus production. It was also shown that both ATF6 and IREI are required for STATI phosphorylation, highlighting the necessity of ATF6 for inhibition of innate immune response [
 <xref rid="CIT0230">230</xref>]. CHIKV and SINV also cause frequent epidemics of febrile illness and long-term arthralgic sequelae [
 <xref rid="CIT0231">231</xref>]. These viruses replicate in mammalian cells (HEK293) indicating that they have definite control over the host’s UPR system. CHIKV specifically activates the ATF6 and IRE1 cascades and suppresses the PERK pathway [
 <xref rid="CIT0231">231</xref>]. CHIKV NSp4 expression in mammalian cells suppresses eIF2α phosphorylation, which regulates the PERK pathway [
 <xref rid="CIT0231">231</xref>]. The experimental findings showed that SINV induced uncontrolled UPR, which was reflected by the failure to synthesize ER chaperones, followed by increased phosphorylation of eIF2α and activation of CHOP which led to premature cell death [
 <xref rid="CIT0231">231</xref>]. These results highlighted the differences in mechanisms of UPR regulation by similar viruses. Another study showed the activation of XBP1 pathway when neuroblastoma N18 cells were infected with the arboviruses JEV and DENV [
 <xref rid="CIT0232">232</xref>]. This was seen by splicing of XBP1 mRNA and activation of 
 <italic>ERDJ4, EDEM1</italic>, and 
 <italic>p58</italic> genes. Applying small interfering RNA to reduce XBP1 had no effect on cellular susceptibility to the two viruses but enhanced cellular apoptosis [
 <xref rid="CIT0232">232</xref>]. These results suggest that both JEV and DENV trigger the XBP1 signaling pathway and take advantage of this cellular response to alleviate virus-induced cytotoxicity [
 <xref rid="CIT0232">232</xref>].
