<p>Recently, scientists showed that influenza virus HA glycoprotein induced a strong innate antiviral response through activating ER stress via ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) which mediates HA degradation. They suggested that three class I α-mannosidases were distinguished to play a critical role in initiating HA degradation, including EDEM1, EDEM2, and ERManI (
