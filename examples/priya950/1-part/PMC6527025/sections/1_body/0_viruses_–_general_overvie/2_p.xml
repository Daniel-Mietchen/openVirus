<p>Globally, lower respiratory tract viral infections are among the top 10 causes of death, along with cancers, stroke, and diabetes [
 <xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. However, some viruses have beneficial aspects. For example, Reovirus, a Class III dsRNA virus, has oncolytic properties against different types of malignant tumors; thus, it is being explored as a potential tool for cancer treatment [
 <xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. Vaccines are a common defense against virus infections. Vaccines have been derived from whole or subunits of viruses. For example, the hepatitis B vaccine was developed from the viral surface antigens from the inactivated plasma of a carrier [

 <xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. Baculoviruses, which are insect viruses, infect and kill the larval stage of insects in the order 
 <italic>Lepidoptera</italic>, which are the second most diverse insect Order [
 <xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. The caterpillar stages of these insects cause great economic harm. The use of Baculoviruses serves as a natural pesticide. The advantage of using these viruses is that they are insect-specific; thus, they do not harm humans. In addition, unlike chemical pesticides, Baculovirus use does not lead to environmental pollution.
