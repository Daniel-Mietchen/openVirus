<p>Several studies were conducted on ZIKV. The results of the study by Hamel et al., showed a major role for the phosphatidylserine receptor AXL as a ZIKV entry receptor, and cellular autophagy in enhancing ZIKV replication in permissive cells [
 <xref rid="CIT0172">172</xref>]. Thus, ZIKV is able to increase its replication via induction of autophagy in infected skin fibroblasts. A murine experimental model was infected with Brazilian ZIKV. It was demonstrated that Brazilian ZIKV crosses the placenta and causes microcephaly by targeting cortical progenitor cells, inducing cell death by autophagy and apoptosis in mouse neural tissue, and impairing neurodevelopment [

 <xref rid="CIT0174">174</xref>], a study on the Drosophila brain system suggested an essential role for Drosophila stimulator of interferon genes (dSTING)-dependent autophagy to restrict ZIKV infection and to control neuronal infection [
