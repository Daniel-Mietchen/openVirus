<p>JEV infection induces autophagy in several cell types. A study which used an Atg5/Beclin-1 knock down model and monitored LC3 lipidation in JEV-infected NT-2 cells, a pluripotent human testicular embryonal carcinoma cell line, after treatment with rapamycin and 3-methyladenine, revealed a direct relationship between autophagy and viral replication. They showed that autophagy has supporting roles in JEV replication in the early stages of infection [

Sharma et al. observed in their study, using Neuro2a cells, and WT and atg5−/− mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs), that autophagy primarily restricts viral replication. They observed significant colocalization between NS1 and EDEM1 and that autophagy antagonizes JEV infection and functions to limit viral replication and reduce viral yields through LC3-I- and EDEM1-containing membranes [
