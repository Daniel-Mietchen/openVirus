<p>Although the process remains unclear, autophagic membranes enable some viral particles to reach the extracellular space either in exosomes or viral envelopes. Flaviviruses normally use autophagic membranes both for replication and exocytosis through multivesicular bodies (MVBs). DENV reduces p62, an autophagy receptor, via proteasomal degradation, to support its replication [
