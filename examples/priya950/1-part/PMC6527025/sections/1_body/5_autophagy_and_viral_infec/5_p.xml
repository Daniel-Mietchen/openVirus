<p>However, despite all these protective cellular strategies, some viruses have evolved several tactics to escape, inhibit or even recruit multiple steps of the autophagy pathway to their benefit. Several classes of viruses have been reported to manipulate the autophagosomes and induce autophagy during infection, using them as a physical platform for viral replication machinery by recruiting autophagy to protect itself from detection by the host immune system, concentrate essential intermediates and also achieve their maximal viral replication in vitro [
