<p>The origin of autophagosome membranes in yeast is likely to be 
 <italic>de novo</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0092">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0093">93</xref>]. However, this is a contentious subject in mammalian cells. There are a wide range of sources that can contribute to autophagosome formation (e.g.; ER–Golgi intermediate compartments, ER–mitochondria junctions, mitochondria, endosomes, and the plasma membrane). However, evidence supports the notion that isolation membrane nucleation occurs at a distinct site and emanates from the ER [
 <xref rid="CIT0094">94</xref>]. Formation of the autophagosome can be triggered by different types of cellular stress, such as amino acid starvation, growth factor deprivation and other types of external stressors [
 <xref rid="CIT0081">81</xref>]. During the biogenesis of autophagosomes, either portions of the cytoplasm (bulk autophagy) or distinct cargo molecules (selective types of autophagy) are sequestered in the interior of these transport carriers and enclosed during phagophore formation and expansion [
 <xref rid="CIT0081">81</xref>]. Ultimately, autophagosomes either fuse directly with lysosomes to expose their content to hydrolytic enzymes, or first fuse with endosomes to form intermediate compartments called amphisomes before the autophagosomal cargo reaches the lysosome where cargo is degraded and metabolic molecules are delivered to the cytoplasm [
