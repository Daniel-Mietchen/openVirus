<p>Almost 30 genes from the autophagy-related (ATG) family regulate the autophagy process. These genes were first identified in yeast and later their orthologues were identified in humans [
 <xref rid="CIT0090">90</xref>]. Upon activation of the autophagy process, a series of Atg protein complexes orchestrate the formation of double membranous vesicles called autophagosomes that capture cytoplasmic cargo. Cargo receptors bind both cargo and to the autophagosome LC3-II component and help in the process of sequestration [
 <xref rid="CIT0091">91</xref>]. Fusion between the autophagosome and lysosome leads to the formation of the autolysosome. Lysosomes contain hydrolases that can help in the degradation of cargo. Cargo is then degraded into amino acids, nucleosides, fatty acids, and sugars and they are released into the cytosol for recycling [
