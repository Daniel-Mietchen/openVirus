<p>Autophagosome formation includes three steps: initiation, nucleation, and expansion. The first step in formation of autophagosome is at the phagophore assembly site (PAS) (isolation membrane) where proteins of the unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) complex combine in order to begin autophagosome formation [

In the final stage, the autophagosome membrane recruits the ATG12–ATG5–ATG16 complex, which facilitates microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3; LC3) lipidation with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The isolation membrane expansion is dependent on LC3 (the mammalian homolog of yeast
