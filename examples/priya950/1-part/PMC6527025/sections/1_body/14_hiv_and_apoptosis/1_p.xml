<p>Patients infected with HIV experience a progressive decline in the number of CD4 + T-cells, which results in immunodeficiency and susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens and malignancies. The primary basis of a decline in the number of T-cells is an increase in apoptosis of CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Although immune system activation due to viral infection can be the cause of apoptosis in these immune cells, analyses showed that HIV specific proteins have a role in apoptosis induction [

Since viruses are intracellular parasites that use the host cell machinery to replicate and get assembled, many viruses have mechanisms to prevent apoptosis for the benefit of the virus itself, but such anti-apoptotic machinery is not present in HIV. HIV-encoded proteins can induce apoptosis in infected and in uninfected cells (i.e. paracrine death) [
 <xref rid="CIT0326">326</xref>]. In HIV infection, the virus binds to CD4 + T-cells by binding to the CD4 receptor. The virus is subsequently internalized into the T-cell where HIV Tat protein is thought to increase the expression of Fas receptor, resulting in excessive apoptosis of CD4 + T-cells by the extrinsic pathway [
