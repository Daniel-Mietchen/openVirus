<p>Tat is an inducer of apoptosis in infected cells potentially by Fas-dependent mechanism, superoxide dismutase inhibition or activation of cyclin-dependent kinases. The ability of Tat to induce cell death has been demonstrated in vitro for neurons and CD4 + T-cell lines. Tat is readily secreted by infected cells, and cellular and humoral immunity to Tat may have protective effects against HIV progression [

This proposal is supported by the fact that human infections with naturally occurring Nef deletion mutants lead to less rapid CD4 + T-cell depletion [
