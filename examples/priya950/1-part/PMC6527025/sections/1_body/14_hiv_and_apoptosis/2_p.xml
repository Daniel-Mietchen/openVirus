<p>GP120 is an HIV viral envelope glycoprotein that can bind to and cross-link the CD4 receptor and the chemokine co-receptors (CCR5 and CXCR4) (
 <xref rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>). Cross-linking of CD4 + T-cells by GP120 causes the induction of enhanced susceptibility to Fas-mediated killing. In the previously activated cells, GP120 cross-linking results in apoptosis (possibly mediated by IFN, TNF or both), downregulation of Bcl-2 expression and activation of caspase 3. GP120 can also induce apoptosis in uninfected CD4 + T-cells. Circulating immune complexes and replication-incompetent viruses that contain GP120 can also induce death in a similar manner [

GP120 can activate the Bax-dependent apoptotic mitochondrial pathway, which involves Puma, Bax, Bak, Cytochrome C, etc. The interaction of GP120 with CXCR4 can also cause MMP (mitochondrial membrane permeabilization) through pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (Gia) P38 MPAK pathway and/or through a Ca
 <sup>++</sup> dependent mechanism [
