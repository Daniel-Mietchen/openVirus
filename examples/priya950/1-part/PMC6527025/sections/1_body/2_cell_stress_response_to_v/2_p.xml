<p>Since viruses manipulate cellular machinery for the production of progeny viral particles, they heavily depend on cellular proteins like heat shock proteins for proper folding and assembly of the viral proteins [
 <xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]. Viruses like cytomegalovirus (CMV – a herpesvirus) and Flaviviruses (DENV, ZIKV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)) induce the host UPR response, which promotes increased protein folding and successful viral replication, while other viruses like herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) work to downregulate the IRE1/XBP-1 branch of the UPR pathway [

 <xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. These stress-induced responses are crucial in the manifestation of virus-induced effects like ZIKV-induced development of microcephaly, influenza virus-induced inflammatory damage, and reactivation of HSV-1 in previously quiescent human fibroblasts [
 <xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>]. Modulation of autophagic flux, as well as induction of intracellular oxidative stress, are also used by viruses like ZIKV and influenza virus to promote viral replication and increase virally induced cell damage [
