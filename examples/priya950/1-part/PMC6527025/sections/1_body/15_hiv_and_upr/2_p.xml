<p>HIV infection is capable of inducing BiP (chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein) both in vivo and in vitro, potentially resulting in an environment that favors continued protein folding, which is a significant indication of UPR activation [
 <xref rid="CIT0334">334</xref>]. HIV infection was also shown to be an important factor contributing to higher levels of P-eIF2Î± in cells from an HIV patient, which leads to translational inhibition inside the cell [
 <xref rid="CIT0334">334</xref>]. HIV can also induce higher levels of IRE-1 phosphorylation, a hallmark of IRE-1 activation. One of the most important downstream effects of IRE-1 activation is the splicing of XBP1 mRNA, which in this condition will be translated as an important transcription factor that induces the expression of ER stress-response genes [
