    <td align="left">WNV activates multiple UPR pathways.
     <break/>XBP1 pathway was not necessary for WNV replication; however, ATF6 was degraded by the proteasome and PERK pathway transiently phosphorylated eIF2α and induced the pro-apoptotic protein CHOP.
     <break/>The host mechanism to counteract WNV infection involved activation of CHOP-dependent cell death.

    <td align="left">UPR PERK pathway was not activated.
     <break/>The WNV Kunjin strain NS4A and NA4B proteins are potent inducers of UPR. Moreover, sequential removal of hydrophobic domains of NS4A decreased UPR activation.
     <break/>Hydrophobic residues of WNV Kunjin strain NS proteins activate UPR signaling.
     <break/>In contrast, upon infection with WNV, IREI-deficient cells did not illustrate any distinct difference as compared to IREI-positive cells.
     <break/>In the absence of ATF6, other UPR signaling cascades such as PERK and IRE1 pathways could not activate. It was also shown that both ATF6 and IREI are required for STATI phosphorylation, highlighting the necessity of ATF6 for inhibition of innate immune response.

     <break/>SINV induced uncontrolled UPR, which was reflected by the failure to synthesis of ER chaperones, followed by increased phosphorylation of eIF2α and activation of CHOP
