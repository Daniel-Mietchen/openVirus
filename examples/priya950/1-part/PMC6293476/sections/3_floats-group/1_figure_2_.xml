  <p> SR9009 preferentially inhibits alphavirus replication and suppresses inflammatory gene expression in murine macrophage cell lines. A, Huh7 cells were infected with O’nyong’nyong virus (ONNV; MOI 5), GFP-expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GFP; MOI 0.5), or Zika virus (ZIKV; MOI 3) and treated with increasing doses of SR9009. Supernatants were titered at 24 hpi. B, Huh7 cells were infected with ONNV (MOI 10) or left uninfected. At 6 hpi, cells were trypsinized and seeded on top of Raw264.7 cells pretreated for 1 hour with SR9009 (final = 10 µM) or DMSO. Twenty-four hours later, total RNA was harvested from the co-cultured cells and analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with murine-specific primers. Values are the means± SD. Significant values are defined by
