<p>Viral replication is a spatially and temporally regulated sequence of metabolic reactions within the host cell that results in accumulation of biomass in the form of viral particles that reinitiate the same cycle in the neighboring cell. Thus, manipulating the host cell to render the intracellular environment hostile to the replication cycle is 1 method of inhibiting viruses. Rev-erbα/β belong to the nuclear receptor family of genes and are ubiquitously expressed transcriptional repressors that, upon binding to endogenous heme in the ligand binding domain, recruit corepressors to downregulate target genes involved in circadian rhythm, metabolism, and inflammation [

The presence of a ligand binding domain allows these factors to be pharmacologically exploited, and synthetic agonists have been developed that target Rev-erbα/β to improve metabolic dysfunction of diet-induced obesity in mice and inhibit inflammatory response in immune cells [
