<p>Rev-erb α/β are ubiquitously expressed ligand-activated transcriptional repressors with diverse physiological functions, including circadian rhythm, inflammatory response, central carbon metabolism, and lipid homeostasis, and synthetic agonists have been developed that ameliorate metabolic dysfunction in mouse models [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), and there was no accumulation of unprocessed polyprotein or evidence of enhanced degradation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that even though viral translation is poised to be favored after host translation is blocked, subgenomic RNA translation is still inhibited. Although the mechanism is not clear, SR9009 might modulate the composition of the endoplasmic reticulum to hinder proper insertion of viral polyprotein. Alternatively, the ribosomal complex or subunit that is required during alphavirus replication, but not VSV or flavivirus replication, may be altered such that ribosomal loading of RNA or translation initiation is prevented. Further studies are required to pinpoint the mechanism that targets alphaviruses.
