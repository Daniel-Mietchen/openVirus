<p>Rev-erb α/β also repress inflammatory response in macrophages [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and this may be physiologically pertinent to alphaviruses, as macrophages are involved in joint damage induced by infection and host response [

 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In an in vitro co-culture system, we show that Rev-erb agonist can suppress macrophage transcript levels of select inflammatory genes (IL6, TNFα, CCL2, and MMP9) (

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and implicated in alphavirus-induced joint pathology [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additional studies may be warranted to determine if Rev-erb agonists can suppress arthritogenesis after CHIKV infection in vivo. Plasma levels of SR9009 have been reported to reach up to 20 μM in murine studies [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], near the range we tested in our in vitro studies (10–20 μM).
