<p>SR9009 has also been shown to downregulate inflammatory gene expression when macrophages are challenged with various tissue damage stimuli [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As macrophages play a role in alphavirus-induced arthralgia and infection causes cytopathic effect [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we sought to determine whether inflammation in macrophages can be subdued by SR9009. Huh7 cells were infected with ONNV (or left uninfected) and seeded on top of murine Raw264.7 macrophage cells that were pretreated for 1 hour with SR9009 or DMSO. The in vitro co-culture simulates contact of macrophages with infected cells. Twenty-four hours after co-culturing, intracellular RNA was harvested for qRT-PCR analysis using primers that only detect murine mRNA. When Raw264.7 cells were co-cultured with ONNV-infected Huh7 cells, there was elevation in mRNA levels of CCL2, IL6, TNFÎ±, and MMP9 that were reduced by SR9009 (
