<p>To identify which step of the infectious cycle is hindered upon application of the agonist, we first analyzed an early event of the viral life cycle, the formation of replication complexes where viral RNA is synthesized. Cells were infected with CHIKV and treated with SR9009 as before. At 12 hpi, cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody against double-stranded RNA. We did not observe any striking difference in the localization or level of dsRNA (

Quantitative assessment of viral RNA synthesis was performed with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at 12 and 24 hpi. There was no significant difference in the levels of CHIKVE1, and the only statistically significant difference in the level of CHIKVnsP2 was at 12 hpi (
