<p>The 4 primary vectors of SLEV in the United States are 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens pipiens</italic> Linnaeus, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus</italic> Say, 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> Coquillett, and 
 <italic>Cx. nigripalpus</italic> Theobald mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>1</italic>
 </xref>). Vector species distribution determines the geographic distribution of SLEV, and affects whether epidemics are urban or rural. Urban SLE epidemics usually involve 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus</italic> (
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> complex) mosquitoes, species that oviposit in the permanent aquatic habitats provided by storm drains, sewage treatment facilities, and wastewater retention ponds. Rural SLE epidemics usually involve floodwater species, such as 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tarsalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>nigripalpus </italic>mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>1</italic>
 </xref>). Urban and rural epidemic transmission patterns are best demonstrated by the history of SLEV in Florida, where urban human SLEV cases were detected in Miami in 1952 and 1954, followed by St. Petersburg in 1959, Tampa in 1961, and Sarasota in 1962. In 1977, SLEV epidemic transmission in Florida shifted from urban to rural areas (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>7</italic>
 </xref>). The 1977 and 1990 Florida SLE epidemics both started in Indian River County and then spread throughout the Florida peninsula (

  <italic>7</italic>
 </xref>). The temporal shift from urban to rural epidemic transmission in Florida was facilitated by changes in 
 <italic>Cx. nigripalpus</italic> oviposition preference and behavior. The 
 <italic>Cx. nigripalpus </italic>mosquito is a widespread subtropical species and a highly opportunistic blood feeder that oviposits in freshly flooded temporary aquatic habitats. In urban habitats, 
 <italic>Cx. nigripalpus </italic>mosquitoes oviposit in wastewater retention ponds and open wastewater outflow ditches (

  <italic>10</italic>
 </xref>). The shift to rural transmission in 1977 and 1990 was facilitated by an increase in citrus farming, as citrus groves were designed to be maintained by flood irrigation (
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>10</italic>
 </xref>). In the 1970s through the 1990s, rural citrus grove drainage furrows became the preferred oviposition site for 
 <italic>Cx. nigripalpus </italic>mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>11</italic>
 </xref>). The proclivity of 
 <italic>Cx. nigripalpus </italic>mosquitoes to blood-feed on birds as well as mammals and the tendency of females to delay oviposition until the proper aquatic oviposition habitats are created by heavy summer rainfalls make it an excellent vector of SLEV (
