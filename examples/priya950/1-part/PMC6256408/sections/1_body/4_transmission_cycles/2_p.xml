<p>The introduction of WNV into the United States in 1999 promoted debate about how the presence of WNV would affect the continued transmission of SLEV, given the serologic cross-reactivity of the 2 viruses in avian hosts. Laboratory studies demonstrated that house finches (
 <italic>Haemorhous mexicanus</italic>) experimentally infected with WNV developed neutralizing immunity that prevented infection after rechallenge with WNV or SLEV (

  <italic>12</italic>
 </xref>). In contrast, house finches first exposed to SLEV showed lower subsequent viremias after rechallenge with WNV. This suggests that WNV could competitively exclude SLEV from amplification in shared avian hosts like house finches (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>13</italic>
 </xref>). Indeed, transmission of SLEV in Florida decreased notably following the introduction and establishment of WNV (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>13</italic>
 </xref>). For competitive exclusion to suppress SLEV transmission, considerable host overlap between SLEV and WNV must occur. In Florida, avian species in the families Cardinalidae (northern cardinal, 
 <italic>Cardinalis cardinalis</italic>), Columbidae (mourning dove, 
 <italic>Zenaida macroura</italic>), Corvidae (blue jay, 
 <italic>Cyanocitta cristata</italic>) and Icteridae (common grackle, 
 <italic>Quiscalus quiscula</italic>) are frequently exposed to SLEV (
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>14</italic>
 </xref>). For WNV, house sparrows (
 <italic>Passer domesticus</italic>) and blue jays are highly infectious to mosquitoes; in contrast, mourning doves were found to be 1 of the least competent WNV hosts of 25 bird species examined experimentally (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>15</italic>
 </xref>). Even if mourning doves are poor WNV hosts, being exposed to WNV may provide cross neutralization to SLEV and preempt amplification of SLEV, provided that doves are exposed to WNV early in the transmission season. In California, sparrows, finches, and corvids (house finch, house sparrow, purple finch [
 <italic>Haemorhous purpureus</italic>]); song sparrow (
 <italic>Melospiza melodia</italic>); western scrub jay (
 <italic>Aphelocoma californica</italic>); and white-crowned sparrow (
 <italic>Zonotrichia leucophrys</italic>) are considered major amplifying hosts of WNV and SLEV (
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>1</italic>
 </xref>,
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>16</italic>
 </xref>). As in Florida, host overlap of WNV and SLEV likely contributed to the initial disappearance of SLEV from the western United States (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>17</italic>
 </xref>). Of these avian hosts, only house sparrows, house finches, American crows (
 <italic>Corvus brachyrhynchos</italic>), and western scrub jays were found to be amplifying hosts capable of developing viremias above the threshold for infection of 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic>, the principal vector of WNV and SLEV throughout much of California (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>16</italic>
 </xref>). Further work is needed to characterize the specific avian hosts fed on by 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis </italic>mosquitoes in epidemic and nonepidemic settings to determine whether additional host species may be involved in amplification of SLEV and to what degree host overlap contributes to the competitive exclusion or reemergence of SLEV in areas of the United States outside California.
