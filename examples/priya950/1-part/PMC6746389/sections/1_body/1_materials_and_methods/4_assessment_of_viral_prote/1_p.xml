<p>Huh7 cells were seeded into 6 well plates at 300 000 cells/well. The next day, cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 0.1, 2, 10) in the presence of the MNTD of the inhibitors as described above. After removal of the virus, cells were incubated in complete DMEM/inhibitor until cells were washed in PBS, detached by trypsinization, and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris•HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) at 24 hpi. Cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at &gt;16 0000 x g for 10 mins at 4°C and total protein concentration determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and proteins transferred to PVFD membranes using semi-dry transfer. Western blots were probed with antibodies against nsP1 (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, in-house)[

After washing in PBS, the western blot was incubated for 1 hr at RT with the respective secondary antibodies (IRDye 800CW Donkey anti-Mouse; IRDye 680LT Donkey anti-Rabbit; Li-Cor). The membrane was dried an imaged using the Odyssey Fc Imaging System (Li-Cor).
