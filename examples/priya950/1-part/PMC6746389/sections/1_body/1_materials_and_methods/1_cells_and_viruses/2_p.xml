<p>The CHIKV ICRES and CHIKV-Fluc replicon (SGR), in which the ORF-2 region encoding the structural proteins has been replaced with sequence encoding firely luciferase, cDNA clones were previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Both are based on the isolate LR2006 OPY1, representing the East Central South African genotype. CHIKV TST-nsP3 was generated by synthesizing a 129 bp DNA fragment containing the twin-strep-tag (TST) encoding sequence flanked by two SpeI restriction sites (ThermoFisher Scientific). This fragment was cloned into the CHIKV-Fluc SGR using a unique SpeI site in region corresponding to the hypervariable domain of nsP3 (position 5222). The TST-nsP3 fragment was then excised and cloned into the CHIKV ICRES plasmids using the unique KfII and the AgeI restriction sites. All CHIKV plasmids were linearized using NotI and

 <sup>6</sup> BHK-21 cells using a single square wave pulse (260 V, 25 ms). Cells were seeded into a 75cm
 <sup>2</sup> flask and incubated for 48 hrs at 37°C. Supernatant was harvested, clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at room temperature (RT), aliquoted and stored at -80°C. The CHIKV titer was determined by standard plaque assay on BHK-21 monolayers and expressed as plaque forming units/ml (PFU/ml).
