<p>Huh7 cells were seeded into 12 well plates at 100 000 cells/well. The next day, cells were washed and incubated in live cell imaging solution (140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 20 mM Glucose, 1% BSA) supplemented with the MNTD of inhibitory compounds for 50 mins at 37°C. Cells were incubated on ice for 10 mins and Alexa Fluor 488 EGF complex (Invitrogen E13345) was added to a final concentration of 0.8 μg/ml. After 45 mins, cells were fixed in 4% Formaldehyde/PBS and imaged using the IncuCyte ZOOM system (Essen Bioscience). The default software parameters for a 12 well plate (Corning) with a 10× objective was used for imaging 4 fields of view/well. A processing definition was established to automate identification of Alexa Fluor 488 positive objects. The green object count/well was extrapolated by the IncuCyte ZOOM software. Two wells/conditions were analyzed in three biological repeats. A one-way ANOVA was employed and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was performed comparing each sample to the untreated sample. A modest, but significant decrease in Alexa Fluor 488 EGF uptake upon treatment with the carrier control (DMSO) was controlled for by additionally comparing the samples to DMSO-treated samples in the Dunnett’s multiple comparison test.
