<p>Huh7 cells were treated with MNTDs of Ribavirin, DIDS, 9-ACA, IAA-94, NNPB and DMSO (control) as follows. Huh7 cells were seeded into 12 well plates at 100 000 cells/well. The next day, CHIKV at MOI 2 (2xPFU as determined on BHK-21 monolayers/Huh7 cell number) and the respective inhibitor were diluted in 150 μl complete DMEM and adsorbed to the cells for 1 hr at 37°C. CHIKV/compound was removed, cells washed with PBS and incubated for 12 hrs in DMEM/compound. Supernatant was then harvested the titer of released CHIKV determined by plaque assay. To determine the virucidal activity of the compounds, the inhibitors and CHIKV were diluted into 150 μl with complete DMEM and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr prior to adsorption to the cells. Treatment with DEPC was conducted by diluting CHIKV and DEPC (2 mM final concentration) in PBS and incubating at RT in the dark. CHIKV and compounds were adsorbed to cells for 1 hr at 37°C and were then removed and cells incubated for 12 hpi in complete DMEM. The supernatants were harvested and CHIKV titer determined by standard plaque assay. The impact of the compounds on CHIKV attachment to the cell surface was investigated by performing CHIKV adsorption in the presence of the inhibitors at 4°C for 1 hr to prevent uptake. Cells were then rigorously washed with cold PBS and returned to 37°C in complete DMEM. At 24 hpi supernatants were harvested and CHIKV titer determined by standard plaque assay at 24 hpi. The first two hours of the CHIKV lifecycle were investigated by treating the cells with the inhibitors in 1 ml DMEM 1 hr prior to absorbing the virus in the presence of the inhibitors. After removal of the virus, cells were incubated one further hour in 1 ml complete DMEM plus inhibitors before these were removed by washing in PBS. Cells were then kept in complete DMEM until the titer of the released virus was determined at 12 hpi.</p>
