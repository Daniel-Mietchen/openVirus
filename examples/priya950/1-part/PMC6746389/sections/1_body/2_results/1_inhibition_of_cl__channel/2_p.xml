<p>To confirm these findings, the expression of CHIKV nsP1 and capsid protein in the presence each Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitor were determined by western blot analysis. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g001">Fig 1B</xref> shows reduced expression of nsP1 and capsid in DIDS, 9-ACA and NPPB-treated cells compared to untreated/DMSO-treated cells and only in the presence of IAA-94 were nsP1/capsid levels unaffected. DIDS, 9-ACA, NPPB and Ribavirin were found to inhibit CHIKV replication in a dose dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g001">Fig 1Ci–1Civ</xref>). This data further implies that functional Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels are required during the CHIKV lifecycle. The inhibitory effect on viral protein expression was consistent in cells infected with greater and smaller MOIs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007703.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). To exclude any direct virucidal activity of the compounds, CHIKV virions were incubated with the MNTD of each compound 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> at 37°C for one hour prior to their dilution in media and infection onto untreated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). DEPC was included in this assay as a positive control, as it has previously been shown to modify histidine’s on CHIKV glycoproteins, preventing viral fusion [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Treatment with DIDS, 9-ACA, NPPB and Ribavirin had no significant effects on the CHIKV titer following direct virion treatment, implying that the compounds do not inactivate the viral particle. Taken together, these data provide the first reported requirement for DIDS-, 9-ACA- and NPPB-sensitive cellular Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels during the CHIKV lifecycle.
