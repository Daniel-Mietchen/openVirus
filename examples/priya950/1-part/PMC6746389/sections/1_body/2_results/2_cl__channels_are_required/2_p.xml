<p>The first CHIKV particles fuse with endosomal membranes as early as 2 mins post-infection, making CHIKV entry a rapid process (12). Indeed it has been reported that almost all CHIKV particles escape the endosomal system within the initial 22 mins of infection. Following endosomal fusion, the viral capsid is released, genome is translated and replication complexes begin to form. We investigated the requirement of Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels during this early lifecycle stage by adsorbing CHIKV onto pre-treated cells for 1 hr at 37°C (MOI 2). Virus and compound were then removed and non-cell associated viruses were washed from cells. Cells were treated with each compound for a further 1 hr and after their removal, CHIKV titers were assessed at 12 hpi. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, 9-ACA, NPPB and Ribavirin had no effect on CHIKV infection when treatment was limited to the early lifecycle stages. DIDS-treated cells, however, displayed reduced CHIKV titers (p ≤ 0.05), consistent with its modest effects on virus attachment. Some of the inhibitory effect associated with DIDS-treatment appeared to be non-specific and associated with general inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, since cells accumulated lower levels of Alexa Fluo 488 EGF following DIDS-treatment (
