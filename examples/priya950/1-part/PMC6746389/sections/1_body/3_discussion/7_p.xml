<p>Interestingly, CLIC-dependent Cl
 <sup>-</sup> efflux has been shown to act during NLRP3 inflammasome activation and signaling [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and it has recently been shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in CHIKV infected humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A small molecule inhibitor of the inflammasome abrogated inflammatory pathology in mice without influencing the CHIKV titer. This could imply that CLIC Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel function is also involved in the inflammatory response to CHIKV infection, in addition to its role in efficient CHIKV genome replication. Inhibitors specific to CLIC1 and CLIC4 may hold potential as both CHIKV antivirals and inhibitors of the CHIKV inflammatory response. Specific inhibitors would exclude possible off-target effects caused by the currently available broad acting Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors.
