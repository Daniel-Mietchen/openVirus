<p>In conclusion, for the first time this study identifies Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels as essential host cell factors for efficient CHIKV replication and in conjunction with other recent studies highlights the significance of ion channel modulation as a druggable target to inhibit virus infection. Notably, we show that the requirement for cellular Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels is conserved between human and mosquito host cells and it is likely that other Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels are required at various stages of the CHIKV lifecycle. In general, Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels may represent a potential target for the development of antivirals acting against a broad variety of (arbo-)viruses and encouragingly Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors are in clinical or pre-clinical use [

 <sup>-</sup> channel specific compounds for future anti-CHIKV strategies.
