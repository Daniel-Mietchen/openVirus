 <sup>-</sup> channels at the cell membrane regulate an array of cellular processes including cell-volume control, fluid transport and cell excitability. Intracellularly, Cl
 <sup>-</sup> transport across organelle membranes regulates endosome, lysosome and Golgi acidification. We observed inhibitory effects for three out of four assessed Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors on CHIKV replication in mammalian cells (
