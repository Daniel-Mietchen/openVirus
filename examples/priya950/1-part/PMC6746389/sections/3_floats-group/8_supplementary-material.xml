  <title>Effect of Cl
   <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors on CHIKV replication in invertebrate cells.
  </title>
  <p>C6/36 cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 2) in the presence of the MNTD of DIDS, 9-ACA and IAA-94 and Ribavirin. The viral titer was determined at 24 hpi (n = 3). Error bars represent standard deviation. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare samples to untreated cells. *** p≤0.001, **** p≤0.0001.</p>
