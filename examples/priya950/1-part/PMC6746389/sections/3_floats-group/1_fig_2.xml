   <sup>-</sup> channels are mainly required during post-attachment/early stages of the CHIKV lifecycle.

   <bold>A)</bold> Huh7 cells were treated with the Cl
   <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors for 1 hr prior to adsorption of CHIKV (MOI 2) at 4°C to facilitate attachment but prevent internalization of the virus into the cell. After removal of the virus, cells were returned to 37°C and titer of released CHIKV was determined at 24 hpi (n = 3). 
   <bold>B)</bold> Huh7 cells were treated with compounds for 1 hr prior to adsorption of the virus. Virus was then removed and cells incubated with the compounds for one further hour. The titer of released CHIKV was determined at 12 hpi (n = 3). 
   <bold>C)</bold> Huh7 cells were treated with the compounds for 1 hr at 37°C prior to addition of the Alexa Fluor 488 EGF complex. Cells were fixed after 45 mins and the green object count/well determined using the Incucyte Zoom (n = 3). The modest, but significant decrease in Alexa Fluor 488 EGF uptake upon treatment with the carrier control (DMSO) was controlled for in the analysis by comparing the samples to DMSO-treated samples in the one-way ANOVA. Error bars represents standard deviation. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare samples to untreated/DMSO cells. ns = not significant, *p≤0.05; ** p≤0. 01, *** p≤0.001, **** p≤0.0001.
