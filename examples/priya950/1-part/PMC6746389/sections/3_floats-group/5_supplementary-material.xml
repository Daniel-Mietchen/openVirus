   <bold>(A)</bold> and C6/36 cells 
   <bold>(B)</bold> were incubated with increasing concentrations of Cl
   <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors, Ribavirin and carrier (DMSO) only. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay after 6 hrs and 24 hrs of treatment, respectively (n â‰¥ 3). Arrows indicate the maximal non-toxic doses. Error bars represent standard deviation. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare samples to untreated cells.
