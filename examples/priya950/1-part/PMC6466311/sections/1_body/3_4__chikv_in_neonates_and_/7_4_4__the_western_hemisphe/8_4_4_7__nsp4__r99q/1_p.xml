<p>During the 2014â€“2015 outbreak in Guiana, 26 febrile children under three months of age infected with CHIKV-WH with a R99Q substitution at nsP4 were hospitalized [

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The nsP4 gene is the most highly conserved gene of the alphaviruses and encodes an RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase that functions in producing the synthetic properties of the viral replicase complex [

 <xref rid="B141-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Research investigating amino acid substitution of this protein has shown reduction in viral replication [
 <xref rid="B141-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. The R99Q substitution replaces a positively charged, basic arginine with an electronegative, polar glutamine. This change could cause changes to protein structure and function, though it is unknown how this mutation may have contributed to disease.
