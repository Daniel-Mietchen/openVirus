<p>The CHIKV-WH genotype is a descendant of the Asian lineage and contains a four amino acid deletion in nsP3, an amino acid insertion at the 3’ UTR, and substitutions at E2: 368 and 6K: 20 [

 <xref rid="B127-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. In CHIKV, the nsP3 gene encodes a phosphoprotein required for RNA replication and is the major contributor to the virulence of alphaviruses because it interacts with a variety of host proteins (reviewed by Lark et al. [
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]). The hypervariable region of nsP3 determines cell specificity for infection and replication [

 <xref rid="B130-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Deletions within the hypervariable region of nsP3 in other alphaviruses has resulted in attenuation of virulence in mosquitos and decreased neurovirulence in mice [

 <xref rid="B133-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. In CHIKV, deleting even a single element of nsP3 can reduce replication [
