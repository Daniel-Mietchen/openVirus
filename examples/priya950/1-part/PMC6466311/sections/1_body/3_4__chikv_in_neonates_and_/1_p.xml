<p>With the awareness of the potentially serious consequences of neonatal and pediatric CHIKV infections, much greater attention is now given to arboviral infection in infants and children. The identification of CHIKV in neonates has occurred more frequently in recent outbreaks and infection typically occurs during delivery (

 <xref rid="B110-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. However, the scientists who described the early outbreaks were fully capable of documenting febrile disease in pregnant mothers and newborns. They provided comprehensive reports of severe disease and death in the young and old, and they documented abnormal syndromes thus, why would they not have reported symptoms seen in todayâ€™s outbreaks if they were present? The modern technology explanation is not sufficient as early scientists used techniques such as ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization tests which are still used today and are gold standards for identifying CHIKV as a causative agent [
