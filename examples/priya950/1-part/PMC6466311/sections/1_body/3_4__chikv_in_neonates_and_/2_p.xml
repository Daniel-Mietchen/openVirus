<p>Prior to the epidemics in 2005 and the emergence of CHIKV in the Western Hemisphere, there were three distinct lineages of CHIKV that were described [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. ECSA with the A226V mutation is thought to be the most pathogenic, CHIKV-Western Hemisphere (CHIKV-WH) of intermediate pathogenesis, and the unmodified ECSA and West African strains the least pathogenic [
