<p>During November 2015 in Brazil, a newborn infected with CHIKV ECSA K211E mutation developed a macular erythematous rash and fever, which progressed into encephalitis with generalized seizures [

 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Fortunately, the infant fully recovered after a few weeks and no long-term sequelae were reported [

A short distance away in Salvador, Brazil, two vertically infected infants developed a rash, fever, and signs of bacterial infection but recovered within a month after delivery, even though one of the infants had developed a grade 1 intracerebral hemorrhage [
