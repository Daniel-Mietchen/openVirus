<p>Historically, this genotype has been identified in all other regions of Africa. It was the virus identified in the early accounts described as a dengue-like illness punctuated by severe arthralgia [

 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. However, once this virus was imported into new regions, mutations contributing to its spread were identified. Mutations contributing to increased pathogenesis have not been identified though recurrent genetic motifs have been documented through efforts to track the movement of CHIKV into new regions.
