Many neonates infected during the first and second trimester exhibited abnormalities including hyperpigmentation, pre-term birth, fever, and various cardiac defects including atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and persistent foramen ovale [

Genetic studies of these Sri Lankan outbreak strains have indicated that they were of the East/Central/South African (ECSA) lineage with novel mutations that formed a unique cluster, completely separate from other CHIKV isolated in other areas of Sri Lanka and in subsequent outbreaks [
