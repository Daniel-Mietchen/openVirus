<p>This review highlights the limitations of our knowledge regarding CHIKV pathogenesis. This is likely a result of the disconnect between clinical and basic science. In clinical research, the main focus is diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Viral disease is often diagnosed via serological or nucleic acid tests that focus on small portions of the genome (usually the envelope protein). Viral lineages and mutations are rarely emphasized unless the knowledge could direct patient care or impact diagnostic assays. Point mutations are usually ignored as long as a definitive diagnosis can be made. On the contrary, basic phylogenetic research focuses primarily on the genetic sequence. Often times, genomes are derived and characterized from insect samples and, when obtained from patient specimens, little if any attention is given to the clinical profiles of patients. Furthermore, very few viral genomes have been obtained from children and neonates given their inherent vulnerability as a research population.</p>
