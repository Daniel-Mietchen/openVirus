<p>CHIKV has been reported as a cause of febrile illness in children and neonates since the 1960s. Following the reemergence of CHIKV in the regions surrounding the Indian Ocean and the expansion of CHIKV into the Western Hemisphere, CHIKV-WH infections in children and neonates are reported more frequently and with more severe syndromes and sequelae (

While severe CHIKV disease can be linked to unique viral genotypes, the contribution of novel mutations to disease pathogenesis has yet to be described. For instance, the K221E mutation occurs in both the ECSA and CHIKV-WH genotypes and has been identified in neonatal and pediatric infections with severe cutaneous lesions (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00294-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, if the K211E mutation, is combined with a second mutation (ECSA E2: V264A and CHIKV-WH E2: L284F), there is a marked increase in disease severity, though it is unclear if these mutations are the cause (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00294-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Characterization of other mutations present in these isolated genomes has not been performed. This is unfortunate as the non-structural proteins have been shown to be involved in viral pathogenesis and neuroinvasiveness more frequently than envelope proteins due to their myriad of functions in viral replication, whereas the functions of the structural proteins are for host cell recognition, binding, and entry [
