<p>It is of interest that divergent and geographically distinct CHIKV genotypes can induce similar disease syndromes. If a single mutation can confer increased vector competence, as with the A226V mutation, then surely there are viral mutations that contribute to viral replication in skin, placental, or CNS tissues. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of mutations that have yet to be characterized. Through the use of site-directed mutagenesis of infectious clones or sub-genomic replicon strategies, it is possible to evaluate functional mutations in a silent background. With over 6100 CHIKV sequences available on GenBank, we just need to look.</p>
