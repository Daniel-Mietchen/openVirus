<p>It is of interest that arthralgia was less frequently reported for CHIKF caused by the Asian lineage than the African lineages (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00294-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, hemorrhagic fever was more commonly diagnosed in children infected with CHIKV of the Asian lineage (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00294-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While genetic motifs related to viral pathogenesis havenâ€™t been described for these three lineages, a unique V386G mutation was identified in the E2 gene of the Asian phylogroup [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The change from highly non-polar valine to a small polar glycine could have significant effects on protein structure and function though, since this particular residue is buried next to the capsid and is not likely to play a part in pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is likely that there are other lineage-specific motifs that correlate with disease.
