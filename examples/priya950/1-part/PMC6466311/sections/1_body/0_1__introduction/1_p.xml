 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00294" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CHIKV is a small, enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome approximately 12 kb long, which is divided into two open reading frames. The first section comprises the four non-structural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4) that are responsible for viral replication inside the host cell cytoplasm. The second open reading frame encodes the structural proteins (capsid, envelope 3 (E3), envelope 2 (E2), 6K, and envelope 1 (E1)). CHIKV can be classified into three genetic lineages based upon sequences of the E1 gene [
