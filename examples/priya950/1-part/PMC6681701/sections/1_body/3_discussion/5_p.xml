<p>Although specific surveillance and control measures were integrated to represent the current situation in France, the model's outcomes were in close agreement with the results of Halasa et al. (

However, our results evidenced a low degree of permeability of the swine production network regarding the virus's invasion potential, which is nevertheless highly dependent on the awareness and vigilance of all the actors and stakeholders in the production system (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and the availability of the resources needed for clinical visits, sampling, analyses and on-site culling. Assumptions have been made in this evaluation, but the model could also be used to assess more precisely the impact in different scenarios of the availability of resources on the duration of ASF epidemics. In the present work, only domestic pigs were considered and a single introduction site was assumed. This major assumption may be overoptimistic regarding the pressure of infection exerted by wildlife in all the countries infected thus far (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Thulke and Lange developed a spatially explicit individual-based model to represent ASF spread in the wild boar population, and provided evaluations of control measures based on the implementation of fences, population management, and carcass removal procedures (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Coupling these two approaches would provide the opportunity to analyze the infectious processes as a whole, which is a real challenge when attempting to manage a disease at the interface between wild and domestic ecosystems.
