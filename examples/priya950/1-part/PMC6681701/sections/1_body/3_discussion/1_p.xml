<p>African swine fever has been spreading throughout Eastern Europe since 2007 and recently emerged in Western Europe (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although the threat has been highlighted for many years, the incursion of ASF into Belgium in September 2018 was relatively surprising since the closest infected countries were Poland and Hungary (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The long-distance infectious process, although not fully elucidated, is deemed to be related to human activity. Since then, and despite strong control measures, ASF is continuing to spread among wild boars, with a recent report of more than 700 positive animals (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Although fences have been set up along the neighboring boundaries, the risk of the ASF virus entering Luxembourg, Germany and France is non-negligible, and highlights the need for analytical tools to evaluate the economic and epidemiological consequences of such an introduction, as well as the efficiency and feasibility of surveillance/control policies in light of the local context and specificity of the population structure. The modeling framework designed by Halasa et al. (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) was dedicated to this issue and was used in their study to evaluate the spread of the virus among the Danish swine production network. This model was therefore chosen for application to the French situation, which required factoring in realistic geographic distribution of production sites as well as features related to the structure of French pig movements within the population (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The authors have chosen not to discuss here the epidemiological assumptions and parameters behind the model, which were already well-discussed by the original authors. Therefore, the discussion will focus on the main conclusions and prospects for the future that could be derived from the model's outcomes. This study evaluated two different scenarios of introduction depending on the type of herd selected as the index case.
