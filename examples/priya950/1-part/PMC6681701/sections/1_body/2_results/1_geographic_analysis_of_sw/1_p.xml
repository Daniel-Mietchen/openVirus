<p>A large disparity in swine herd distribution was observed over continental France and Corsica, with swine densities varying from 6 to 396 pigs per km
 <sup>2</sup> in the four zones. The highest densities were observed in the western and south-western parts of France (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Each production site was assigned to its relative density zone to assess the impact of the index case location on ASF spread and control effectiveness. Excluding slaughterhouses, post-weaning-finishing and finishing herds have the highest indegree regarding growing pig movements, with 42 and 37% of between-site movements, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, left). In contrast, movements of breeding animals from multiplier herds were mostly directed toward farrow-to-finish pig herds (57% of movements) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, right). Trade operators also received a high proportion of breeding animal movements (23%). However, these sites mostly represent a gathering step on the route to slaughterhouses or exportation; &lt;1% of outgoing movements of breeding sows from trade centers were directed toward production sites. The herds were categorized according to their sizes, defined as the total number of sows, post-weaning and finishing pigs. Farrowing, farrow-to-finish, multiplier, and nucleus herds represent the largest proportion of large herds with 68, 67, 70, and 58% of these herds recorded as having more than 1,000 animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Movements of pigs were reported at batch level, with batch size distribution depending both on the type and size of source herds. The average batch size contained 72 piglets but ranged between 1 and 432 animals (1–99% percentiles). The largest batch sizes were observed from farrowing and post-weaning herds, where batches could exceed 600 individuals. The distribution of the distances covered by breeding and growing animals revealed huge discrepancies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,B</xref>). The movements of growing pigs were short-ranged, 55% remaining within a 50-km radius, and the proportion of movements decreasing exponentially with increasing distance. In contrast, the farm-to-farm movements of breeding animals follow a long-tailed unimodal distribution pattern reaching a peak at 100–150 km distances but going as far as 850 km.
