<p>ASF is a notifiable disease according to European legislation, and strict containment and eradication policies are implemented in the European Union in the event of its suspicion. However, such policies require substantial human and financial resources, which drive the ability to detect the emergence of the virus in free countries and to control its spread in the meantime (hot period). Predictive modeling may therefore help to anticipate the extent of the virus's spread and to evaluate potential surveillance and control measures tailored to specific incursion scenarios. Halasa et al. recently developed such a model to analyze the epidemiological and economic consequences of ASF introduction on the swine production network in Denmark (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The modeling framework was adapted to reflect the real-life situation of the French swine production system and the implementation of recent surveillance and control policies adopted in response to the imminent ASF threat. The DTU-DADS-ASF model (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) offers many different outputs directed toward epidemiology, economics, and resource requirements to be able to respond to the emergence of ASF in France. The objective of the present paper was to evaluate for the first time the epidemiological consequences of this virus's introduction into the French swine production system. We therefore essentially focused on epidemiological outcomes and detection procedures (e.g., the time to detection, duration of the epidemics, and the number of infected herds) to assess the efficiency of emergency surveillance plan in light of the diversity of the French swine production landscape.
