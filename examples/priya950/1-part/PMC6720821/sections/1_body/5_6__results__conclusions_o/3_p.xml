<p>This has now also independently been shown by paleobiological studies. By 2014, 20 articles had been published containing, inter alia, 12 studies of biological material obtained in plague graves or pits which with probability or certainty related to the Black Death of 1348â€“50. The samples have consistently yielded positive identifications of 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> in localities as far apart as London and Montpellier. In all, these 20 articles give the outcomes of 45 biomolecular studies of skeletal material obtained in putative plague graves or burial pits in 40 different localities and of hundreds of specimens of individual skeletal remains, 4 of them relating to the Justinianic pandemic and 36 to the second pandemic. In all cases, 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> was recovered, not in a single case was there any suggestion of Filoviridae contagion [
