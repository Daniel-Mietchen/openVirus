<p>By use of the Reed–Frost SIR mathematical epidemiological model, Scott and Duncan and Christakos and Olea et al. had allegedly produced strong evidence that the Black Death and historical plague was not bubonic plague caused by transmission of the bacterium 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> by rat fleas but was a (variant of) Ebola disease or Marburg disease spread by direct transmission of living contaminated cells from a diseased to a healthy person. Clearly, they were entirely wrong in both respects and for several reasons made clear by Maia in his presentation of the Reed–Frost model and even more by Abbey whose fine contribution is ignored.
