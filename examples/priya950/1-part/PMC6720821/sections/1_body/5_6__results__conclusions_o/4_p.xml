<p>The historical epidemiological analysis and the paleobiological analysis produce the same factual historical outcome. By invalidating the Filoviridae theory, these forms of analysis also demonstrate that use of (mathematical epidemiological) models to produce proof of aspects of historical reality at some level of tenability is a fallacy of methodology producing illusory reflections of the models. They also show why the proper usage of models is restricted to hypothesis formation.</p>
