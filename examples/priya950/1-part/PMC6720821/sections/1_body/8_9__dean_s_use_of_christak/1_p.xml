<p>As shown by Dean's extensive use of Olea and Christakos' article on the “duration of urban mortality,” the spatial dimension is not included. Nonetheless, Dean maintains that information on “weekly and monthly” “distribution of deaths is sometimes the only way to understand the dynamics within a past epidemic, without rapid diagnoses and contact tracing.” This statement implies that the conventional identification of epidemic disease by study of the distribution of deaths according to territorial spread, the movement of the disease by diseased according to location of dwelling or street and time, can be dispensed with and substituted by model-based analysis. This statement is supported by an immediately following assertion that “the first SIR-model developed by Kermack and McKendrick was fitted to the number of deaths per week for the 1905-06 plague epidemic in Bombay.” However, Dean uses Christakos et al.'s temporally extended Reed–Frost model with data according to month, not by week. She models, e.g., the burial data of Givry in the same way as Christakos et al., according to month [

This temporal choice has the same effect of losing the specific shape of the initial phase of the epidemic which is incompatible with the Filoviridae theory and also incompatible with the human ectoparasite theory but easily compatible with rat-based-flea-borne bubonic plague and as such a defining feature of this modality of plague.
