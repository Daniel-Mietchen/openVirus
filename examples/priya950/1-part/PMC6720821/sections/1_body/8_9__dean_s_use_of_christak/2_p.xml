<p>Otherwise, the reference to Kermack and McKendrick's modelled data for the 1905-06 epidemic in Mumbai is superficially correct but, in reality, misleading. The reason is that it is not made clear that Kermack and McKendrick's statistical analysis, clarifying comments, and presentation of the curve of the incidence of deaths by week between 12.17.1905 and 07.21.1906 simply show the number and temporal distribution of deaths. They do not suggest possible use of it for inference to the mechanism(s) of transmission and not for inference to the pattern of intralocal or interlocal spread of the epidemic in an urban centre, in casu Mumbai. They simply assume a priori that, in Mumbai, “plague in man is a reflection of plague in rats” and insert this crucial condition together with other central assumptions. Crucially, they observed nothing in their curve or equations that could suggest otherwise [
