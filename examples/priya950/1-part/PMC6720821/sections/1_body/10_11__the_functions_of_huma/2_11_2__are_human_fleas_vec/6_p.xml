<p>This line of reasoning can be developed further. Among the 272 plague patients who were individually examined for (level of) bacteraemia, there were 7 cases with the relatively high levels of 10
 <sup>6</sup>–1.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> bacteria/mL of blood. They can be designated statistical outliers because there is a wide gap down to the next level of highest recorded levels of bacteraemia. By very far, the highest level of human plague bacteraemia on record is a unique or extreme outlier with 4 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> bacteria/mL [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These 8 statistical outliers, who constitute 2.9% of all individually examined human plague cases for (level of) bacteraemia, probably represent the normal prevalence of cases with primary bacteraemic plague. Fleas feeding on the 7 human cases with a level of bacteraemia of 1–1.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> will, according to the sex-specific infection gauges, ingest ≥180/410 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> bacteria. Taking into account fleas' ability of self-purification, it seems likely that also these cases will, for all practical purposes, be infection-free at the time of the next blood meal.
