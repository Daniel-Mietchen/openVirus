<p>When fleas ingest sufficiently contaminated blood, bacteria follow into the stomach, technically called the ventriculus or midgut. In addition to the midgut, the stomach system of fleas also consists of a proventriculus or foregut with a valve function allowing fleas to make, relatively speaking, huge intakes of blood because the valve prevents the blood in the strongly distended midgut after a feed from forcing its way back out. After a blood meal, fleas do, therefore, rarely attempt to feed more frequently than once in 24 to 72 hours, which represents the minimum interval between feedings, normally “perhaps every 4 or 5 days” [

 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In the meantime, fleas digest the blood meal and pass it gradually into and through the lower digestive tract (hindgut). Only when most of the meal is digested, will fleas again feel hungry and start the search for a new feeding opportunity. This means that the digestive process takes on the character of self-purification of the infection so that, as a preliminary consideration, at least 97% of feeding fleas which have fed on human plague diseased will for all practical purposes be infection free and noninfectious at the time of the next blood meal taken from plague-diseased human beings.
