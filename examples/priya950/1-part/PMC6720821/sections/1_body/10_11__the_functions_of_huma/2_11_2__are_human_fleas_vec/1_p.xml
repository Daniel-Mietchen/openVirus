<p>A significant or central vectorial role in plague epidemics for human fleas and lice are dependent on several necessary conditions that generally are not considered by proponents of human ectoparasite hypotheses of plague transmission: (1) the prevalence and levels of human plague bacteraemia; (2) the general size of blood meals ingested by human fleas and lice; (3) the consequent number of ingested plague bacteria; (4) the lethal dose (LD) of plague bacteria for human beings, normally expressed as the number causing death for half of those infected, LD
 <sub>50</sub>; and (5) efficient mechanism of transmission by lice and by fleas. The factual answers to all these crucial questions can be ascertained. The problems and perspectives involved are too comprehensive to be presented and discussed in detail here, but the gist can be presented also briefly and satisfactorily filling the lacunae on these matters in the discussion.
