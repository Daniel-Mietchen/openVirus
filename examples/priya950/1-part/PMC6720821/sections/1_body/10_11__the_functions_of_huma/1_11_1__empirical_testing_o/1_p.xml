<p>In recent years, several scientists have claimed that human fleas and lice were the predominant vectors of the plague epidemics of the past, for instance, Dean, Whittles and Didelot, and Dean et al., all using Reed–Frost or other close variants of S(E)IR mathematical epidemiological models which do not permit study of epidemic disease transmitted by insects. Although on the methodological principle, analogue models cannot produce evidence with empirical status, these scholars refer to the outcome of their use of S(E)IR models as evidence [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Dean and Dean et al. also refer as evidence to the fact that human lice and human fleas have been found to be infected by plague bacteria after having fed on human plague patients with bacteraemia, i.e., with plague bacteria in the blood stream. Evidently, this does not per se contain indication of vector capacity or ingestion of lethal doses. They refer to G. Blanc and M. Baltazard's two-page 1942 poster inspired by a tiny endemic rural outbreak in Morocco (90 cases) in 1941 [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], without mentioning that it was immediately severely criticized in a long article by Girard [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], a former leader of the French research effort on plague in Madagascar in the capacity of director of the Institut Pasteur de Anatanrivo 1922–1940 and then director of Institut Pasteur de Paris, which must have been a serious matter for two scientists at Institut Pasteur du Maroc. They do not refer to Blanc and Baltazard's 1945 treatise [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] that has been analysed by several scholars, consistently highly critically as methodologically and materially severely flawed, a discussion that have been gathered together and presented in a form suitable for consideration and discussion [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. All blood sucking insects including mosquitoes, bed bugs, and ticks and also flies, ants, beetles, and cockroaches which have ingested bloody cough from pneumonic plague patients or other plague material become infected but no one has argued that they function as (significant) vectors of plague contagion [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The fact that insects feeding on bacteraemic human blood become infected does not imply and cannot serve as evidence of a vectorial capacity for plague disease or transmission of lethal doses.
