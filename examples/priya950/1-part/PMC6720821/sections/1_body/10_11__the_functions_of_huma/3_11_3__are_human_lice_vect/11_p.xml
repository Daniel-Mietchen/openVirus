<p>The prevalence and levels of plague bacteraemia among black rats are hugely different from human plague bacteraemia: rats (and guinea pigs) generally develop nearly 1000 times higher levels of bacteraemia than human beings, that is, as a comparison between cases who develop bacteraemia and are comparable, which only a minority of human plague cases does. In reality, therefore, the real difference is much bigger [

A large proportion of plague-diseased rats will infect feeding fleas with numbers of plague bacteria conducive to formation of blockage/biofilm [
