<p>Plague bacteria are not evolutionarily adapted to preserve virulence during the passage through the hindgut. Defecated plague bacteria have strongly reduced virulence. Also, “the faeces do not, as a rule, contain many bacilli and soon dry up” [

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Large-scale experiments with fleas have consistently shown negative or highly restricted results with respect to possible transmission of plague bacteria by rubbing faeces into bite wounds or scarified skin on guinea pigs which are extremely susceptible to plague infection, according to the lice-typhus model [

 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], studies which are not mentioned. In nature, this potential route of infection would be strongly negatively affected by the fact that “fleas seldom deposit faeces when feeding and the reactions following the bites of rodent fleas rarely cause itching” [
