<p>According to the feeding capacity of female and male human lice, they must ingest blood with levels of bacteraemia of, respectively, ∼6,300 and ∼15,200 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>/mL in order to take in 1 plague bacterium, which is the infection gauge or infection-level divisor of female and male lice, respectively. This means that 3 of the 272 human plague cases examined for level of bacteraemia would infect feeding human female lice, on average, with nearly 2 bacteria per blood meal, 5 cases with inaccurate measurements would infect the feeding female lice with 0–&gt;∼160 plague bacteria, 7 cases with ∼160–240 bacteria, and only the extreme statistical outlier with 4 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> would be a source of a presumed LD for human beings, and only this case would infect a male louse and then with 66 bacteria. These data show that lice, for all practical purposes, will not ingest lethal doses of plague by feeding on human plague cases and by vast margins. Because lice feed 3 times/day and with simultaneous profuse defecation, there will not under any circumstances be time for significant bacterial growth in the gut or hindgut.
