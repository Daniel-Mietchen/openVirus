<p>Blanc and Baltazard neglected to examine the group of 90 plague cases constituting their research material with respect to prevalence and levels of human bacteraemia and thus their possible function as sources of infection of feeding ectoparasites. However, quite accidentally, as it seems, they withdrew blood from 2 of the 90 plague cases (nos. 4 and 24), who were examined by haemoculture. It transpired that that one was bacteraemic, i.e., 50% [

Evidently, they had the opportunity of testing the basic and crucial premises of their hypothesis that human plague cases quite generally develop bacteraemia and at sufficient levels to infect feeding human fleas and lice with sufficient doses for epidemic lethal transmission but refrained from using it. They also could have availed themselves of IPRC's data.
