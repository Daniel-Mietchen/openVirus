<p>In addition, advocates of an important vectorial role in plague epidemics for human lice also refer to a more recent article presenting laboratory experiments. Experiments with lice performed by Houhamdi et al. allegedly support the notion of a vectorial role for human lice [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Nonetheless, arguably they are highly unsatisfactory in many respects [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In these experiments, lice were fed on rabbits inoculated with 10
 <sup>9</sup> cfu (colony-forming units) of plague bacteria without relating to the questions whether transmission of such a huge load of plague bacteria occurs in nature, the usual size of infections ingested by lice on naturally plague-infected rabbits, and the relative incidence of possible consequent transmission of plague by lice. Another matter is the relevance of the choice of rabbits in relation to epidemic potential in human habitation and social contexts. They also do not consider whether collective movement of groups of infected lice would occur in nature. Lice are evolutionarily adapted to stay in a fixed position on the host and have innately very poor ability to move (by crawling) and were, in this case, helpfully transferred by scientists simultaneously onto other animals. The experiments are also performed without a real consideration of the experiments' relationship with human plague bacteraemia which would be the source of infection in plague epidemics, only in a highly selective and unrepresentative manner. These experiments were basically similar to the experiments purportedly proving the efficiency of early-phase transmission that Hinnebusch pointed out were based on “important parameters with little or no experimental [i.e. empirical] support” [
