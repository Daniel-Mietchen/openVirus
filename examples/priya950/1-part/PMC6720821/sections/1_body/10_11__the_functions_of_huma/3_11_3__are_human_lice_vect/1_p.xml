<p>Some experiments with lice are, as mentioned, used to advocate an important vectorial role for this ectoparasite in plague epidemics. Dean and Dean et al. refer for evidence to the fact that human lice have also been found to be infected by plague bacteria after having fed on human plague patients with bacteraemia. However, as pointed out, this does not constitute evidence of ingestion of LDs of plague bacteria or of subsequent development of LDs in the gut or the hindgut before the next feed. It is evidently also not evidence of capacity of transmission, for instance, by the rubbing of infected faeces into itching bite wounds by the hosts themselves, according to the rickettsial mode of infection. Dean and Dean et al. refer only to Blanc and Baltazard's two-page 1942 poster inspired by a tiny endemic rural outbreak in Morocco in 1941 [

 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], which, as shown above, has been analysed by several scholars, consistently highly critically.
