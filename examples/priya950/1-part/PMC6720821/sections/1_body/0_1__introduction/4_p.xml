<p>The use of the verb “feel” is unfortunate and should be replaced by “think” or “consider” rather. Also epidemiological mathematical models are inherently analogues, based on an analogy between the spread of contagion in a human population according to “the logic and patterns of social life.” In the case of plague, this premise also includes the “logic and patterns” of behavioural strategies of specific species of fleas and (black) rats and purportedly but erroneously also of human lice (see below). This also shows in the term simulation modelling where models are manipulated by various data until a satisfactory and often preconceived outcome is achieved.</p>
