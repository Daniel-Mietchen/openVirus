<p>It seems to have become a usual misconception that models can be used to prove or corroborate views or assertions on some aspect of reality, to produce empirically valid inferences (at some level of tenability). This has clearly been the case in historical plague research with significance also for the understanding of modern bubonic plague. However, models are in methodological principle analogues and can, as such, only be used to engender or develop (working) hypotheses by seeming similarity. Epidemiology can be considered a medical branch of sociology relating to the spread of disease by human behaviour in interaction with diverse social contexts. The view on models formulated in, e.g., 
 <italic>Modern Dictionary of</italic> Sociology, is useful:
 <disp-quote>
  <p>model: A pattern of relationships, either conceptual or mathematical, which is found in some way to imitate, duplicate, or analogously illustrate a pattern of relationships in one's observations of the world, such as patterns in social behaviour or social structure [.] No single model or combination of models reveals the truth of the structure of reality. Each model is determined by its usefulness for guiding study.</p>
