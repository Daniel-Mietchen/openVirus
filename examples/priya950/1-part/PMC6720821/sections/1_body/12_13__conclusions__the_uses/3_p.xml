<p>In the Introduction, it is pointed out that, methodologically, models are inherently analogues. As such, models can be used to engender working hypotheses by the presumed significance of seeming similarity. The essence of models is that they provide guidance for the construction of working hypotheses that can be empirically tested or for experiments which can provide empirical data suitable for testing. Generation of working hypotheses is highly important and valuable in all forms of research and attests to the scholarly value of models but working hypotheses must be empirically tested to produce evidence on some aspect of social reality at some level of tenability.</p>
