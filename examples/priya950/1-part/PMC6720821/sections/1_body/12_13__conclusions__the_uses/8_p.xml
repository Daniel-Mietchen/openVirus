<p>Mathematical epidemiological S(E)IR models can be useful and valuable in the study of epidemic diseases: (1) These models are useful for generation of working hypotheses which is crucially important in all forms of research. (2) S(E)IR models are also useful in the study of a wide range of viral diseases which provide survivors lasting immunity and are transmitted by direct cross infection. The empirical testing of such models in this article shows why they malfunction in historical plague studies and confirmed the limitations in the range of application indicated by Theordorson and Theodorson and by Maia and Abbey.</p>
