<p>The outcomes of the use of these models with respect to historical plague epidemics can be empirically tested: (1) Paleobiological studies consistently show that historical plague was caused by the conventional plague bacterium

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, Ch. 1.5; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, Ch. 10]. (2) Studies of the prevalence and levels of bacteraemia in human plague cases show that they cannot serve as sources of infection of feeding human ectoparasites that can enable them to transmit lethal doses of plague except in exceedingly rare cases, irrespective of the hypothesis of early-phase transmission (ETP). (3) Studies show that human fleas normally hardly have vector capacity for plague infection and potentially can transmit plague only exceedingly rarely. (4) The proposed role of ETP has been invalidated as a possible or potential epidemic mechanism of epidemic transmission by Hinnebusch et al. [
