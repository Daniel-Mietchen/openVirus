<p>In recent years, several teams of scientists have used mathematical epidemiological SIR or the closely related SEIR models to determine the microbial agent and the dynamics of spread of the Black Death and subsequent plague epidemics of the Second Plague Pandemic (1346-c. 1690). Using basically the same models, they have, nonetheless, identified two entirely different diseases, also different from the rat-and-rat-flea-borne bubonic plague presented in the standard works on plague: historical plague (1) was a Filoviridae disease (e.g., Ebola disease); (2) a bacterial disease caused by the bacterium 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> transmitted by inter-human cross infection by human fleas and lice and, (3) in the case of human fleas, was transmitted by early-phase transmission (EPT).
