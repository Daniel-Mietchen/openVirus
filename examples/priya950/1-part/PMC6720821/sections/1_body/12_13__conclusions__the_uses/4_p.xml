<p>The conclusion is that these incompatible outcomes (and the support for early-phase transmission, EPT) are due to erroneous use of mathematical S(E)IR epidemiological models in two crucial respects. (1) The use does not take into account the range of applications and the limitations pointed out by Theodorson and Theodorson due to these models' basic methodological character as analogues. (2) The incompatible outcomes are also due to the ignoring of the limitations in the uses of these models emphasized by Maia and Abbey. Centrally, they argue that the uses of these models are restricted to viral diseases which give survivors lasting immunity and that are transmitted by direct cross infection and not by intermediary agents such as insects. This means that these models will malfunction if the studied historical plague epidemics were bacterial, e.g., caused by 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, and/or had multiple hosts, e.g., were transmitted by insects such as human fleas and lice or were rat-and-rat-flea-borne according to the medical and historical standard works on plague.
