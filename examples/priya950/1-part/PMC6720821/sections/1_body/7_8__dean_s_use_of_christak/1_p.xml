<p>In her thesis, Dean uses Christakos et al.'s work intensively. She acknowledges that the linear relationship or regression that Olea and Christakos found between pre-plague city size and the duration of plague epidemics during the Black Death [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] formed the basis used “to compare the models we made to historical data from the Black Death” [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For use of models, material, arguments, and support, Dean refers to the book published by Christakos et al. and the two collateral articles published by Christakos and Olea and vice versa, also in 2005, 25 times in 47 pages of running text, 3 times to the book [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], 21 times to Olea and Christakos' article on the “duration of urban mortality” in the Black Death [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], once to Christakos and Olea's article on “New space-time perspectives” [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, she refers once to the 2007 article they published together with Yu, a model-based study on the space-time perspectives on the spread of the Black Death [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. One should note that the essence of the article on the “duration of urban mortality” in the Black Death and its presentation in the book of Christakos et al. [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] above was shown to be at variance with the basic principle of the function of density in epidemiology and consequently with much empirical data, and evidently was fallacious, another illusory reflection of the model.
