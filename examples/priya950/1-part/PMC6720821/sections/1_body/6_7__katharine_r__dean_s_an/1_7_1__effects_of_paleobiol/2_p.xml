<p>Recently, Dean wrote a thesis for the degree of Master of Science called 
 <italic>Modelling plague transmission in Medieval European cities</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] at CEES of the University of Oslo. However, not one of the three medieval cities which Dean studied by Christakos et al.'s version of the Reed–Frost model were medieval cities, namely, “Givry in 1348, London in 1563-64, and Florence in 1630-31.” This is due to not recognizing the historical chronological delimitation of the Middle Ages, namely, c. 500–1500 CE, and the population size-dependent definition of a medieval city of at least 10,000 inhabitants, a criterion which the small town of Givry does not satisfy by a huge margin. In the latter case, it is a reflection of the unquestioning accept of Christakos et al.'s unargued and exceptional use of a generalized concept of city.
