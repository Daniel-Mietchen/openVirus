<p>In 2010, the first synthesis of the paleobiological studies of biological material from historical plague graves was presented and in 2016 an updated version [

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These syntheses showed that paleobiological plague studies had become so numerous, covered such a wide part of Europe, and were so consistent in their identification of

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>–
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Nonetheless, a few years later, it transpired that the Reed–Frost model which Christakos et al. had adapted for their use and used to prove that historical plague was a Filoviridae disease, had become an alternative by another name, SIR models, the use of the Reed–Frost model by nominal proxy.
