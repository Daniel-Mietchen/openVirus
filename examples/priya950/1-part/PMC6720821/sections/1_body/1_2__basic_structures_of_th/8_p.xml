<p>Summing up, also the Reed–Frost variant of a SIR model can only be applied to the study of viral infections which confer lasting immunity in survivors, are spread by cross infection by direct physical contact or by droplets [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in a closed group where people intermingle uniformly and have the same number of contacts and exposure to infection. Conversely, for a number of necessary conditions with separate powers of invalidation, it cannot be applied on epidemic diseases that (1) are or are suspected of being bacterial, (2) do not confer lasting immunity, (3) are conferred by intermediary agents, such as insects, and/or (4) have animal reservoirs, as in the case of bubonic plague. Furthermore, (5) people in historical society did not, by any stretch of sociological imagination, intermingle according to a pattern providing a uniform level of exposure to infection. The social scenes of historical plague epidemics were never “simple situations” as all historians know.
