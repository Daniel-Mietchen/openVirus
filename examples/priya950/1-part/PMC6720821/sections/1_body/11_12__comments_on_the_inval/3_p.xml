<p>On the topic of models suitable for identification of an epidemic disease and the means or mechanism of transmission, I believe, there is only one viable mathematical epidemiological model which has produced valuable and tenable results. It was specifically developed by Roger Scofield, one of the previous century's leading historical demographers, to test the epidemiological and microbiological character of the plague epidemic in Colyton (Devon, England) in 1645-46 on the basis of professional application of the demographic technique of family reconstitution of local society. This allowed him on a strong empirical basis to uncover the real spatial structure of epidemic spread and its impact on various types/sizes of households. He concluded on convincing grounds that it displayed the characteristic features of rat-based-rat-flea-borne bubonic plague [
