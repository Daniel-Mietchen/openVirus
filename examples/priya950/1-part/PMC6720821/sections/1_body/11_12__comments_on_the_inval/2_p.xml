<p>When Whittles and Didelot assert that “the model suggests” that 73.0% of infections in Eyam came from human-to-human transmission (95% credibility interval: [67.3%, 78.2%], with the remaining 27.0% of infections caused by rodents (95% credibility interval: [21.8%, 32.7%]), these assertions are, evidently, illusory reflections of the models. This is also the case with the use of models to underpin assertions with purported empirical status to the effect that human ectoparasites could play an important role in the plague epidemics of the past. Dean states, e.g., that “With this model of louse-borne transmission we can now show that this mode produces a pattern of transmission in towns and cities that is similar to those from the Black Death” [

The assertion that “Mathematical modelling can provide strong insight into mechanisms of plague transmission for past epidemics,” which indicates a clear empirical status for the insight, is also erroneous. Mathematical epidemiological models are analogues that can only be helpful for generating and developing hypotheses suitable for empirical testing. Testing has been performed above and invalidated the model-based results.
