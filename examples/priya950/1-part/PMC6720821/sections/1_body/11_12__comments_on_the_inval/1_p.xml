<p>Dean, Whittles and Didelot, and Dean et al. all resort to the so-called early-phase transmission, a form of transmission without blockage, as the means of transmission by human ectoparasites [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They do not attempt to explain how hypothesized lethal doses of plague bacteria from a preceding feed should be transmitted against the forceful stream of a new feed back into the next bite wound, a formidably counterintuitive proposition. As pointed out earlier, the hypothesis of early-phase transmission has been invalidated as a significant factor in plague epidemics. Taken together, this leaves them without substantiating evidence on the presumption on human plague bacteraemia as sufficient source of lethal bacterial doses and without a functional means of transmission of plague infection. This means not only that the analysed use of S(E)IR models is highly problematic to put it cautiously but it is also without empirical corroboration of crucial conditions, in technical methodological parlance, crucial assumptions are arbitrary.
