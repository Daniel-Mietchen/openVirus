<p>Recently, Whittles and Didelot published a new study of the 1665-66 plague epidemic in the village/township of Eyam using a SEIR mathematical epidemiological model [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A SEIR model is a slightly modified SIR model. It mainly differs from the SIR model in the addition of a noninfectious incubation period (latency period), when individuals who are exposed (E) have had contact with an infected person but are not themselves infectious, which represents the addition of the letter E to the acronym. It is supplemented by a Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) mathematical method that was first introduced by Christakos et al. and supported their finding that historical plague was a Filoviridae Ebola or Marburg disease (see above).
