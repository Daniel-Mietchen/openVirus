<p>As other recent users of S(E)IR models who have had to consider the results of paleobiological studies of plague victims of the past, Whittle and Didelot accept that the epidemic is bubonic plague but also conclude emphatically that their model engenders “conclusive evidence” that interhuman transmission played a predominant role also in the plague epidemic at Eyam. This should according to methodological principles not be possible or be fallacious rather with an analogue model which only can engender hypothetical perspectives or data that must be empirically tested to acquire (some level of) tenability or be invalidated.</p>
