<p>Whittles and Didelot point out that previous use of SIR models on this epidemic only related to the second half of the epidemic because it could not explain its first phase [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This shows again how problematic the use of SIR models are in this field of research and contains a serious warning against use unless the dysfunction is positively explained, which is instead passed over. This statement also includes the sharp decline in burials from October to (almost) insignificant superincidence compared to the normal number of burials in these months, until the epidemic recrudesced with a vengeance in June. The sharp decline from the end of October and its duration through the winter months and the early spring months are incompatible with notions of interhuman transmission of plague because it includes too long intervals without spread of infection and new victims. There is, e.g., no plague burial between 1 and 15 and 28 of January [
