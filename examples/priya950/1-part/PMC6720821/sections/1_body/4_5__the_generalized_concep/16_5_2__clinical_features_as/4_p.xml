<p>There are other clinical features which could be commented on. Scott and Duncan assert, for instance, that they had proved with the Reed–Frost model that historical plague had a very long incubation period of 32–34 days with a very long period of infectiousness. Purportedly, three weeks of this period was an infectious carrier state, and in addition, Ebola cases are infectious during the 5 days of illness. In all, historical cases of plague disease purportedly lasted 37–39 days of which the diseased were infectious for 26 days [

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], there is no contagious carrier state, and contagiousness begins with the course of illness which has a median duration of 8 days (an interquartile range of 7 to 11) [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The alleged features of Filoviridae disease asserted by Scott and Duncan and Christakos et al. are illusory reflections of the fallacious use of a SIR model, in this case specifically the Reed–Frost SIR model.
