<p>This topic contains other important and surprising insights. For their Indian evidence, Christakos et al. consistently refer only to E. H. Hankin's 1905 article where this point is indeed made but within a much broader scope. It was made in the context of statistical material showing generally falling mortality rates with increasing size of settlements, and therefore, much higher mortality rates in small villages than in large villages where it was higher than in towns and cities. Hankin's material and argument are not confined to rural society but also include towns and cities. Christakos et al. refrain from mentioning that Hankin also compared his surprising finding with available English evidence on the Black Death and found evidence of a similar tendency. These empirically supported observations are conspicuously at variance with Christakos et al.'s consistent finding by use of an analogous mathematical epidemiological model that population size and density and social and economic structures were without epidemiological significance [

Hankin made an important pioneering observation of a unique and defining feature of bubonic plague that modern bubonic plague in India and the Black Death in Europe had in common, the inverse correlation between population density and mortality rates. Adequately presented, Hankin's article contains evidence that the Black Death had similar epidemiological properties as modern plague in India and was bubonic plague.
