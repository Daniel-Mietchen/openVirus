<p>Another defining feature of modern and historical bubonic plague formed by the rat-and-rat-flea-borne epidemiology can be demonstrated also by addressing another example of their model-based use of a historical source. This is the only extant continuous parish burial register and covers the Black Death in the town of Givry in Burgundy in France. The register is unpublished, and the basic data are known in the form of a table showing burials per day in the period of the Black Death [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Importantly, Christakos et al. made “a central decision,” namely, “to time mortality 
 <italic>every month</italic>,” which required that they extended the temporal structure of the original 
 <italic>Reed–Frost</italic> model as presented by Maia [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This shows that Christakos et al. did not choose to use the Reed–Frost model because it allegedly, in contrast to other epidemiological mathematical models, included not only temporal but also spatial variables. In practice, they use a mathematical epidemiological model with only a temporal variable and decided to extend the basic unit of temporal organization of the data, in this case the mortality data of the burial register. Although not explained, the temporal extension serves a purpose. As a consequence of the extension, all data displaying distinguishing epidemiological features with a shorter development period than the basic unit of temporal organization of a month will be blurred or disappear when they are fused with many other data.
