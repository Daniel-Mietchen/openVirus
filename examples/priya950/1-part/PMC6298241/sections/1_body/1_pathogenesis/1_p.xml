<p>The epidemiologic features of KD described above strongly support infection with a ubiquitous agent that usually results in asymptomatic infection, but causes KD in a small subset of genetically predisposed children. The occurrence of epidemics and geographic wave-like spread of KD during epidemics supports a presently unknown single agent or closely related group of agents as the etiology. The failure of KD patients to respond to antibiotic therapy makes a viral etiology more likely than a bacterial cause. Moreover, the prevalence of CD8 T cells in the inflammatory infiltrate and the upregulation of cytotoxic T cell and interferon pathway genes in the coronary arteries of children who have died of KD are very suggestive of a viral etiology (
