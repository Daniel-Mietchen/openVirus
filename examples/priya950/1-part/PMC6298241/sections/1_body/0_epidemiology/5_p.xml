<p>Kawasaki Disease (KD) has a striking age distribution, with almost 100% of cases occurring in children, 80% in children &lt;5 years old, and 50% in those &lt;2 years old. In a recent Japanese survey 0.7% of cases were ≥ 10 years old (

The age-incidence curve of KD may help to elucidate risk factors and appears compatible with a ubiquitous highly transmissible infectious agent, and is similar to that seen with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), for example. The peak age of KD is approximately 10–11 months of life, with a relatively low incidence in the first 6 months, suggesting both the possibility of transplacental immunity as seen in many classic infectious illnesses, as well as progressively increasing degrees of immunity to the KD agent throughout childhood.
