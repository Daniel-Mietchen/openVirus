<p>During an outbreak of KD on Mikayo Island, Japan, in 1980â€“1981 (a fairly isolated population of ~80,000 at that time), 9 KD cases were diagnosed in a 1 month period, and 4 of the cases had close geographic and social contacts, supporting the possibility of direct person-to-person transmission of a KD etiologic agent (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). While there is limited other direct evidence to indicate that KD can be transmitted from person to person, for example in a daycare setting, much circumstantial evidence supports an infectious etiology with genetically susceptible individuals manifesting the clinical features of KD and others having trivial or no symptoms. Simultaneous or sequential cases in siblings, twins, or other contacts are reported, especially during Japanese outbreaks (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In Japan, secondary sibling cases occur at rates substantially higher than the general childhood population. Sibling cases are reported more frequently in twins than in non-twins, suggesting both genetic susceptibility and person to person transmission. Japanese family data suggest that sibling cases tend to cluster either on the same day as the index case or 7 days later (
