<p id="par0180">An inherent limitation of using publicly available data is the inevitability of skewed and potentially biased sampling. Sequences sourced from Genbank originate from multiple studies with different methodologies and different motivations for collection. As a result, the quantity of data publicly available from any single location or time period varies. The number of available sequences from Japan, Taiwan and China, where surveillance is more extensive, far exceeds that from countries in Southeast and South Asia, where rubella is often not a notifiable disease. Further, even in the most well sampled locations, sampling biases exist over both space and time. Despite our efforts to correct for this, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional, unsampled lineages circulate, or have circulated, in Southeast Asia and India where sampling is sparse. Further, our analysis does not account for viral exchange with countries from which no samples are present. The possibility therefore remains that other countries may also act as sources. Broader sampling throughout Asia, both in terms of locations represented and the quantity of sequences available, as well across the globe, particularly from rubella-endemic countries that lack access to vaccination, will further refine our understanding of rubella circulation and persistence. Literature on the historical genotypic characterization of global rubella viruses indicates that many subtypes and lineages have gone extinct from 1960 through to the present (
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2013</xref>) and it remains to be seen whether, for example, the introduction of genotype 2B into China will lead to local extinction of genotype 1E. However, as sampling is not consistent or complete across this region, it is difficult to say with any certainty whether lineages have actually gone extinct, are still present at low levels, or are circulating in countries with minimal available data. Our results suggest that rubella lineages are not confined to specific countries and therefore that surveillance and elimination efforts must take into account the epidemiology of the region as a whole and population movements between countries in order to be successful.
