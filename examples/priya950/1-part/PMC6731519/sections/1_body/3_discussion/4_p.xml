<p id="par0150">Given the introduction of rubella-containing vaccine to all children in Japan in 1989, Japanâ€™s role as a sink for viral importation is unsurprising. The outbreaks represented in this study occurred primarily among adult men that were not vaccinated during childhood (

It remains to be seen how rubella dynamics throughout the region will affect Japan as it continues to near elimination.
