<p id="par0140">To understand whether metapopulation dynamics contribute to the persistence of rubella across neighboring countries that vary in their level of vaccination coverage, we combined both phylogenetic and epidemiological lines of evidence. Our analysis indicates that circulation patterns may differ between rubella virus genotypes 1E and 2B. As no evidence of a substantial competitive advantage for either subtype exists to date, these differences therefore suggest that the current distributions are likely a product of stochastic forces and founder effects stemming from the timing of their initial invasion. We confirmed the presence of a major lineage of genotype 1E evolving in China and found evidence for an additional 1E lineage circulating throughout Asia. Although some exchange with countries outside of the region was apparent, recent genotype 1E circulation in Asia appears isolated from the rest of the world. In contrast, we found evidence for multiple, recent introductions of genotype 2B from outside of Asia, suggesting continual global exchange. There was a clear increase in the effective population size of each genotype just prior to the 2011â€“2014 epidemics in Asia, suggesting that simultaneous outbreaks of both occurred. While China serves as a regional source population, particularly for genotype 1E, Taiwan likely acts as an important indicator for regional rubella activity across East and Southeast Asia. In line with high reported levels of vaccination coverage, we find that Japan is a regional sink. Further, India does not have strong epidemiological links to E/SE Asia.</p>
