<p id="par0175">The second scenario we envision to explain synchronized phases of viral growth emerges from extremely high regional connectivity. If the existence of a connection, rather than the magnitude of movement across that connection, is the chief predictor of outbreak timing, we might expect that an epidemic arising in one location will immediately ignite outbreaks in all connected populations whose susceptible population size is above the threshold necessary for a sustained epidemic to occur. Comparable seasonal travel patterns across settings (e.g. driven by similar timing of school holidays (
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">Wesolowski et al., 2017</xref>)) will reinforce this alignment of timing, creating a positive feedback loop to further synchronize dynamics. Sporadic introductions from weakly connected locations that are not part of the core circulation network would then reseed epidemics once the pool of susceptibles has again reached an appropriate size. This scenario is consistent with our study, in that (1) the magnitude of connectivity measured by travel flows was not predictive of viral diffusion, (2) extensive travel and immigration ties exist between countries throughout the region and (3) repeated introductions from outside E/SE Asia were observed for genotype 2B.
