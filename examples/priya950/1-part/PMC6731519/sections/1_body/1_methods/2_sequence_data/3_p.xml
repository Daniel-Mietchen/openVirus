<p id="par0060">Sequences collected from within Asia were geo-referenced by country, and sequences from outside Asia were collectively categorized as “Other”. Due to its wide geographic span and cultural ties to countries in Europe, we included sequences from Russia in the “Other” categorization. Sequences from Eurasia and the Middle East were also included in “Other”, as very few sequences were available from these regions.</p>
