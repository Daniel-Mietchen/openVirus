As global connectedness grows, it is increasingly apparent that an understanding of how human mobility drives the spread of infectious diseases is necessary to predict and control outbreaks of novel or reintroduced pathogens, especially in a context of growing but incomplete vaccination coverage. The identification of genotypes and/or serologically different viral strains with divergent geographic distributions can be used to distinguish new introductions from ongoing but unobserved circulation (

 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Cloete, 2014</xref>); findings indicated that infection tends to flow out from regions of low vaccination coverage, education index and income rather than necessarily between regions in close geographic proximity. While this result is expected at broad global scales, it is not clear that these patterns will hold at finer spatial resolutions, particularly in regions of Asia where geographically adjacent countries that are strongly connected through travel and immigration have highly variable levels of vaccination coverage.
