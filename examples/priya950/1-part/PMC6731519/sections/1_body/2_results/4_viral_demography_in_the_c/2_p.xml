<p id="par0120">WHO case data indicates that incidence increased in most of the focal countries between 2010 and 2015 (supplementary Fig. 1a). With the exception of Vietnam, all focal countries report coverage of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV1) to be above 90% by 2012 (supplementary Fig. 1b), suggesting a level of susceptibility well below the theoretical threshold necessary for elimination based on previous estimates of R
