<p>The major RVF epidemic in South Africa during 2010–2011 included mostly lineage H RVFV isolates, and the smaller outbreaks during the 2 preceding years included lineage C (

The 2018 isolate, SA344-18, detected in the absence of a major epidemic, is closely related to viruses from isolated cases, such as Kakamas-2009 and Beijing-01. These isolates group in the lineage that includes Smithburn vaccine viruses and its parent strain, Entebbe, isolated in Uganda in 1944 (
