<p>Of 10 patients sampled, 8 seroconverted after 2 or 3 serial bleeds, as evidenced by a 4-fold increase in the hemagglutination inhibition assay or virus neutralization test titers (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix </xref>Table 1), and had RVFV-specific IgM, confirming their recent RVFV infection status. We detected RVFV RNA in EDTA whole blood samples of 3 of 4 patients sampled 7 days after estimated symptom onset (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table 1). Sequence-independent single-primer amplification sequencing yielded sequence fragments of the M and L segments in 1 (SA344-18) of 3 samples (GenBank accession nos. MH753234–41). We concatenated these partial sequence fragments (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table 2) and attained 86% (3,341/3,885 nt) of the M segment and 77.7% (4,975/6,404 nt) of the L segment. Only a single fragment was obtained of the S segment (776 nt, 45.9%) spanning nucleotides 18–793 (GenBank accession no. MH753235). Partial sequence fragments of the L segment from another sample (SA343-18) were also obtained; this sequence had a 165-bp overlap with sample SA344-18 (at nucleotides 3,276–3,440) and a single-nucleotide mismatch (A3305T, 99.4% identical) but was not included in phylogenetic analyses because of its close identity to SA344-18 and small fragment size. We prepared alignments with similarly concatenated L and M or partial S sequences from GenBank (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table 3) and a separate alignment with a 490-nt portion of the M segment of SA344-18 and sequences available from GenBank from a previous study, including sequences from the 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa (
