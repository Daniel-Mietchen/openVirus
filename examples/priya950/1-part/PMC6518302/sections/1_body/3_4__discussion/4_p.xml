Another interesting consequence of asymmetrical sexual transmission, i.e., it is easier for men to infect women than vice-versa, is that it allows us to differentiate its effects from those of a mere sexual bias in case reporting (it is known that women are more likely to report any illness than men), because the resulting dynamics are qualitatively different (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00112-f004">Figure 4</xref>). It may be difficult to differentiate these effects from noisy incidence data, but they are nevertheless different things and should be treated accordingly.
