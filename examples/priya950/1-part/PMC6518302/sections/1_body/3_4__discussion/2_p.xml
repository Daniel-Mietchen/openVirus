<p>Due to the current lack of knowledge about the relative effectiveness of other forms of sexual transmission, such as from men to men and from women to women, we have limited our analysis to the better understood transmission from men to women. This lack of a more complete knowledge of the ZIKV transmission cycle is the main limitation of our results. Once the actual transmissibilities of all modes of transmission are known, as well as the relative prevalence in the population of each form of sexual contact, we will be able to exploit the full potential of this model. It is worth mentioning that the transmissibility-modifying parameters, as well as
