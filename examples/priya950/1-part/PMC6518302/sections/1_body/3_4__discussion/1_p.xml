<p>We propose here a mathematical model for studying the combined vectorial and asymmetrical sexual transmission of Zika. The model accommodates all known forms of Zika sexual transmission, as well as vectorial transmission. Vectorial transmission is simplified in the proposed model, because the model seeks to represent a single epidemic where mosquito density is high and is not likely to pose any limits to transmissibility. For modeling of multi-year dynamics, seasonal dynamics of the mosquito population would be required for an accurate description of the vectorial force of infection.</p>
