<p>The proposed epidemic model used is an adaptation of an SEIRmodel proposed earlier [
 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We assume a constant population size, ignoring demographic processes such as birth, death, and immigration, as well as seasonal fluctuations. This is justified as we are studying the dynamics of the system during a single epidemic where demographic variations can be considered negligible.
