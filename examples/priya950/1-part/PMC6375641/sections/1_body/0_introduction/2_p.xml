<p>Rapid amplification also may relate to phenotypic differences between enzootic and epidemic isolates of WNV that enhance avian host and vector infection, facilitating transmission[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. High titer avian viremias, associated with elevated mortality in certain avian hosts, are required to produce efficient mosquito infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and have been a hallmark of WNV epidemics in North America [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Avian virulence in American crows has been related to single nucleotide polymorphisms in the NS3 and NS1-2B proteins [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. After the 2004 WNV epidemic in Los Angeles, elevated passerine seroprevalence and corvid de-population were associated with limited WNV transmission during successive years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the progressive loss of passerine flock immunity and corvid population recovery led to WNV resurgence in 2008 and again in 2011 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Alternatively, decades of pathogen-host co-circulation may have led to a trade-off between a reduction in avian susceptibility as previously shown for House Sparrows (HOSPs; 
 <italic>Passer domesticus</italic>) and increased WNV virulence leading to stable host competence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Interestingly, the competence of several 
 <italic>Culex spp</italic>. populations from California for the NY99 strain of WNV did not change significantly during WNV outbreak years compared to non-outbreak years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], suggesting that epidemics were not linked to changes in vector competence.
