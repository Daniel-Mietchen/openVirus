<p>West Nile virus (WNV; 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Flaviviridae)</italic> naturally cycles among competent avian hosts and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes that serve as both amplification and bridge vectors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Outbreaks of WNV in North America generally have occurred during the warm summer and fall months, when transmission spills over to include humans and other susceptible mammals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since its invasion of California in 2003 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], WNV has not only adapted to and persisted in diverse habitats [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but also has caused several epidemics, impacting public, veterinary and wildlife health [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Most regions of California now have experienced either year-round or repeated seasonal WNV activity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Epidemics have been associated with intense WNV amplification and historically have followed a three-year pattern of introduction, rapid amplification and then subsidence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Factors linked to WNV outbreaks have included above average temperatures and drought conditions, leading to enhanced virus transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Warming temperatures increase vector blood feeding frequency and shorten the extrinsic incubation period of the virus and in California are linked with reduced rainfall that results in increased domestic irrigation and mosquito production from urban drainage systems.
