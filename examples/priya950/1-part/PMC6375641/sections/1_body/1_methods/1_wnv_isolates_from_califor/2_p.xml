<p>The genetically labeled COAV997-5nt virus was utilized as a reference strain in competitions against all the wild type WNV isolates, because its fitness previously has been well characterized

COAV997-5nt was generated from a clone of the COAV997 isolate collected in July 2003 from Imperial Valley, California, early in the WNV invasion of southeast California.
