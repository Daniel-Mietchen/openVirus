<p>Wild, hatch-year HOFI were captured during the summer of 2012 using grain-baited traps at vineyards near Bakersfield, CA, transported to the Arbovirus Field Station at Bakersfield, treated with 0.2 mg per mL of chlortetracycline (Fort Dodge, Overland Park, KS) for two weeks, and tested for the presence of antibodies against WNV, St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV) and western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007135.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Seronegative birds were transported to UC Davis. After a 2-week acclimation period in the BSL-3 aviary, groups of six HOFIs were inoculated subcutaneously with 0.05 mL containing approximately 1,000 PFU of an equal mixture of COAV997-5nt and one of the outbreak isolates. Following challenge, HOFIs were evaluated for the presence of clinical signs until 14 days post infection (dpi), with 0.1 mL of blood collected daily by jugular venipuncture between 1â€“7 dpi and upon termination of the study at 14 dpi. HOFIs were euthanized by placement in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> chamber when they were found moribund or at termination of the study on 14 dpi.
