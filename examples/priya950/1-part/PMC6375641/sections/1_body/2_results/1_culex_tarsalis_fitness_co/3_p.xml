<p>Using a binominal proportions test, we compared expected equal proportions of singly/dually infected

 <italic>tarsalis</italic> and their expectorates to observed proportions specific for either the outbreak isolate or COAV997-5nt. Although dually infected bodies were present in all competition groups, GRLA-04-1624, KERN-07-291 and SAYO-05-912 groups contained greater numbers of singly infected 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tarsalis</italic> (P = 0.05); all expectorants following competition with isolates GRLA-04-1624, KERN-07-291 and SAYO-12-772 contained a single virus strain (P&lt;0.001). The proportion of females infected with the outbreak isolates were not significantly different (P&gt;0.05) compared to COAV997-5nt (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007135.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), and equal numbers of singly infected expectorants contained either KERN-07-291 or COAV997-5nt in that group.
