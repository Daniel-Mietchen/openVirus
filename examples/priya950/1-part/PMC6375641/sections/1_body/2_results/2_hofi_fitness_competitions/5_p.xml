<p>Levels of COAV997-5nt replication gradually declined in hatch-year HOFIs captured between 2010–12, particularly when comparing peak RNA loads on 3 dpi by Mann-Whitney test. HOFIs from 2012 developed peak COAV997-5nt RNA loads of 2.6±0.4 log
 <sub>10</sub>, whereas HOFIs from 2011 showed on average significantly higher RNA loads of 3.8±0.6 (P = 0.004). In contrast, HOFIs from 2010 were more competent developing significantly higher peak COAV997-5nt RNA loads of 4.1±1.5 compared to 2011 (P = 0.01) and 2012 in particular (P = 0.009) (
