<p id="p0030">Africa can be seen as distinct from the rest of the world, and even from other parts of the developing world which are also affected by the emergence and reemergence of diseases. Most dangerous infectious agents that kill humans originate in Africa. In addition, the difficulties with morbidity surveillance in Africa are well known. In the context of the multiple epidemics that have been recognized over the past decade, numerous assessments of surveillance systems have revealed problems essentially across the board

The spending amounted only $6 in Niger, $7 in Sierra Leone and $15 in Nigeria compared to $4800 in the United States. Moreover, 32% of the population is undernourished; five of the six worst countries for mortality of children under 5 years are in Africa, with an under-5 mortality rate above 100 deaths per 1000 live births, according to the World Health Organization. Half of all deaths in Africa are caused by infectious diseases, compared to only 2% in Europe. This means that Africa should be the number one priority in the world community's struggle against infectious diseases. Surveillance of emerging infectious diseases is vital for the early identification of public health threats.
