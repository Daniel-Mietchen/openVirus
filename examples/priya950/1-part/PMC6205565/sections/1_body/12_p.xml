<p id="p0070">Ebola fever due to Ebola virus (
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic>) has caused severe human epidemics identified since 1976. The transmission from animal reservoirs to humans likely happens via direct contact with ill, dead or killed wild animals mainly collected as bushmeat. The virus then spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission. Since 2001, the disease reemerged in the forest zone between Gabon and Republic of the Congo, in Uganda and the DRC

In central Africa, the outbreaks were rural epidemics that occurred in remote locations and involved relatively small case numbers, thus allowing targeted intervention in the affected villages, whereas the West African epidemic was an urban epidemic that occurred in a highly mobile population, leading to rapid spread of the virus. In DRC, new outbreaks still occur regularly (
