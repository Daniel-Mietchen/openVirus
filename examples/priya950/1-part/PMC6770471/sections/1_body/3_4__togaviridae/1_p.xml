<p>Viruses from the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family can be further classified into the genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Rubivirus</italic>. Alphaviruses are anthropod-borne viruses [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and they formed icosahedral particles of about 70 nm with a lipid envelope (

 <xref rid="B55-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The spikes of the virion are made up of E1 and E2 glycoproteins organized in a T4 icosahedral lattice of 80 trimers. The alphavirus virion carries a positive single stranded RNA of approximately 11–12 kb as the genetic material [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The RNA has a 5′-methylated nucleotide cap and a polyadenylated 3′ end. The viral genome is translated into three structural proteins (CP, E2 and E1) and four non-structural proteins (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3 and NSP4) (
