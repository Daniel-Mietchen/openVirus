<p>The original geographical distributions of the CHIKV indicated that there are 3 distinct groups and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the West African, the Asian and the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotypes. The ECSA virus with an A226V substitution in the 
 <italic>E2</italic> envelope gene had caused multiple massive outbreaks in various regions starting in the La Reunion Islands in 2005. The virus then spread to Asia and caused over a million cases in the following years [

The Asian genotype started invading the Americas in 2013, causing massive outbreaks in various countries in Central, South America and the Caribbean. The ECSA virus is now the dominant virus all over Africa and Asia and the Asian genotype is the dominant virus in the Americas [
