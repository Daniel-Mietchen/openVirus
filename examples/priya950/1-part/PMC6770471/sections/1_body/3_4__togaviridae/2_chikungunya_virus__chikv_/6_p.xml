<p>Abeyratne et al. investigated the role of the capsid in CHIKV virulence by studying the nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS) [

 <xref rid="B76-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Mutations in the NoLS capsid of the CHIKV led to the development of a unique live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine candidate designated as CHIKV-NoLS.
