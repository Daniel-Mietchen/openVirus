<p>Comparative sequence alignment of large and small plaque variants of CHIKV primary isolates from the Comoros Island showed two amino acid differences in the nsp2 protease and the nsp3 protein. However, these particular amino acid residues were observed in other CHIKV isolates previously [
 <xref rid="B71-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and the significance of these specific sequences for the small plaque phenotype becomes uncertain. Comparison of the entire genome of the CHK-S with other small plaque variants could provide a better understanding of the small plaque variants. In addition, investigation of reverse genetics can provide further insights into the role of specific mutations in the virulence of the CHK-S variant [
