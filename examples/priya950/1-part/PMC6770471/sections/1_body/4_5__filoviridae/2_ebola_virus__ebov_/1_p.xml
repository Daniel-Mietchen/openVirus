<p>The 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> genus belongs to the 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic> family within the order Mononegavirales. Five species have been identified within the genus of 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic>â€”Zaire (EBOV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), Sudan (SUDV), Tai Forest (TAFV) and Reston (RESTV) [

The other four classified as Ebolaviruses are well-known to cause the Ebola virus disease (EVD). The virus causes a severe fever along with systemic inflammation and damage to the endothelial cell barrier, leading to shock and multiple organ failure with high mortality rates in humans and animals [

 <xref rid="B84-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The Zaire, Bundibugyo and Sudan Ebola viruses are involved in large outbreaks in Africa.
