<p>In addition, nucleotide mutations at positions A82V and P382T were present only in the Ebola virus glycoprotein from the new Ebola epidemic 2014 isolates. Mutation at position W291R was also found only in the 2014 isolate but at a very low frequency of occurrence [

Having a large number of mutations from previous outbreaks present with more than 90% frequency in the sequence of the new Ebola epidemic isolates as well as the emergence of new mutations (A82V, P382T and W291R) indicated the presence of viral quasispecies in the population. The high mutation rates found in a RNA quasispecies increased the probability of escape mutations and this could explain the escape of the 2014 viral isolates from neutralizing antibodies elicited by the old Ebola epidemic isolates. The structural analysis of the Ebola virus revealed the strong contribution of these residues in the three-dimensional rearrangement of the glycoprotein and they played an important role in the re-emergence of the new epidemic Ebola isolates in 2014.
