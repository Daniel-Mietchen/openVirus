<p>The genomes of viruses within the family 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> are non-segmented and thus cannot undergo genetic reassortment. Like many other RNA viruses, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase does not have an error proofreading capability and hence many mutations can occur when the RNA is processed. These mutations can build up in the genome and eventually give rise to new variants. Since each protein has an important function, the mutant viruses will exhibit a loss in viral fitness and are eliminated, leaving only those exhibiting good viral fitness [

 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family, mutations leading to a spectrum of mutant distributions among Measles virus, Mumps virus and Newcastle disease virus are reviewed.
