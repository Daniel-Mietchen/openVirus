<p>The strain Urabe AM9 is one of the mumps virus strains that was widely used in vaccines but this strain was associated with meningitis and was withdrawn from the market. Sauder et al. performed serial passaging of the strain Urabe AM9 in cell cultures and compared the whole nucleotide sequences of the parental (Urabe P-AM9) and passaged viruses (Urabe P6-Vero or Urabe P6-CEF) to investigate the attenuation process and to identify the attenuation markers [

Passaging of the Urabe AM9 mumps virus in Vero or chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cell lines caused changes in the genetic heterogeneity at particular regions of the genome through either changing of one nucleotide at locations where the starting material showed nucleotide heterogeneity or the presentation of an additional nucleotide to produce a heterogenic site. Virulence of the passaged virus was dramatically decreased in the murine model. Moreover, similar growth kinetics of the virulent Urabe P-AM9 and passaged attenuated variants in the rat brain suggested that the impaired replication ability of the attenuated variants was not the main cause of the neuroattenuation. However, in the rat brain, the peak titer of the neuroattenuated variant was almost one log lower than that of the neurovirulent parental strain. For instance, identical but independent induction of heterogeneity at position 370 of the 
 <italic>F</italic>-gene by substitution of threonine to alanine in passaged virus in Vero and CEF cells suggested a correlation of this mutation to the neuroattenuation phenotype. There was lack of ability to identify heterogeneity for those regions with differences of more than 10% between the detected nucleotides in the consensus sequence. The heterogeneity could be the result of new mutations at these positions or the selection of pre-existing sequences within the minority quasispecies. In addition, passaging of the parental strain in CEF and Vero cells led to the observation of several amino acid alterations in the NP, P, F, HN and L proteins that could affect the virulence of the virus. Thus, the modifications of genetic heterogeneity at particular genome sites could have important consequences on the neurovirulence phenotype. Therefore, extra caution should be exercised in order to evaluate genetic markers of virulence or attenuation of variants based on only a consensus sequence [
