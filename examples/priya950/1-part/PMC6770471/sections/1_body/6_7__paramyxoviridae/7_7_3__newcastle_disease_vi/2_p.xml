<p>The NDV genome codes for seven major viral proteins in the order of 5′-
 <italic>N-P(V)-M-F-HN-L</italic>-3′. In NDV, the hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) glycoproteins are presented on the surface of the virion envelope and contribute to viral infection [
 <xref rid="B127-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. The fusion protein is expressed as an inactive precursor (F0) prior to activation by proteolytic cleavage. The cleavage of F0 is crucial for infectivity and works as a key virulence indicator for certain viruses such as virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus 1 (NDV). The F0 cleavage site contains several basic residues which cause the cleavage of the F protein by furin, an endopeptidase present in the trans-Golgi network [
