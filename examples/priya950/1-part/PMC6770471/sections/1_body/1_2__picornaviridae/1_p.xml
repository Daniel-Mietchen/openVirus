<p>Viruses of the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> can be classified into genera such as 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Parechovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aphotovirus</italic> and others. The virion is made up of a non-enveloped capsid of 30 nm surrounding a core positive stranded ssRNA genome (

 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The genome is approximately 7 kb in size and possesses a single long ORF flanked on both ends by the 5′-non-translated region (5′-NTR) and the 3′-non-translated region (3′-NTR) [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The 5′-NTR has an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which controls cap-independent translation. The ORF comprising 6579 nucleotides can be classified into three polyprotein regions, namely, P1, P2 and P3. They encode for structural proteins (VP1 to VP4) in the P1 region and non-structural proteins in the P2 (2A–2C) and P3 regions (3A–3D) following proteolytic cleavage (
