<p>The annual influenza epidemics caused about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness with 290,000 to 680,000 deaths worldwide [

Current influenza vaccines have sub-optimal efficacy, as there was a lack of antigenic proximity between the vaccine candidate and the circulating seasonal influenza virus strains. During the 2016–2017 influenza epidemic, the influenza A (H3N2) viruses from the clade 3c.2a were dominant and was associated with severe onset of the disease. The low vaccine efficacy of the 2016–2017 egg-adapted H3N2 (clade 3c.2a) vaccine strain A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 was reported to be due to altered antigenicity [

To understand the pathogenesis of A(H3N2) viruses from the 3a.2c clade, it would be of great interest to consider if each infection was being caused by an individual strain or by a swarm of genetically related viruses (quasispecies). This would help to provide an insight into the vaccine coverage and efficacy.
