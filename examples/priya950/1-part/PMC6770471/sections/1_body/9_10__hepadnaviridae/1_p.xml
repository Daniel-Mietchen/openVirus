<p>Hepadnaviruses can be found within the family 
 <italic>Hepadnaviridae</italic>. They are further classified into two genera—the mammalian genus 
 <italic>Orthohepadnavirus</italic> and the avian genus 
 <italic>Avihepadnavirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B149-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. These viruses are spherical with 42–50 nm diameter and replicate their genomes with the help of a reverse transcriptase (RT) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-04657-f010">Figure 10</xref>A). The approximate size of the DNA genome is 3.3 kb with a relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) supported by base pairing complementary overlaps [
 <xref rid="B150-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. The DNA genome is made up of four partly or completely overlapping ORFs that encode for the core protein (Core and preCore), surface antigen protein (PreS1, PreS2 and S), the reverse transcriptase (Pol protein) and the X transcriptional transactivator protein [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-04657-f010">Figure 10</xref>B). Replication occurs by reverse transcription of the progenitor RNA by the RNA polymerase II from the covalently close circular form of the HBV DNA [
