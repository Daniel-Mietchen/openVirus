<p>There is some general consensus regarding quasispecies that have been established. For instance, the presence of diverse mutants in a population of viruses is a reality which can affect the biological behavior of the virus in vivo due to the complexity and amplitude of the mutant spectra [

Moreover, interactions amongst variants of a quasispecies population was classified into three types namelyâ€”cooperation, interference and complementation. Cooperative interactions arise from those variants exhibiting advantageous phenotypes compared to the wild-type while interfering interactions are those exemplified in variants with detrimental effects on the replication of the virus. However, complementation interactions have no positive or negative effects on the virus population [
