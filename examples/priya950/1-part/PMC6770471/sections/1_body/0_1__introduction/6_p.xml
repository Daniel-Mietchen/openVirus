<p>Considerably less is known of the relationships between the evolution of RNA viruses with respect to virulence. The dynamics of quasispecies has explained the failure of monotherapy and synthetic antiviral vaccine but opened up new avenues for exploration [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Specifically, unanswered questions pertaining to quasispecies remainâ€”What are the underlying mutations responsible for long term tenacity compared to those of extinction? Are there any molecular determinants which are the root cause of higher virulence in a quasispecies population?
