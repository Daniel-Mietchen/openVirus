This attests to the urgency to understand the mechanisms by which viruses can overcome the different pressures applied to restrict their replications. In the last four decades, breakthroughs in molecular biology have favored in-depth analysis of virus isolates. Findings from other studies have suggested that populations of RNA viruses are divergent and favor an active evolution of RNA genomes. The quick evolution of RNA genomes could lead to variant sequences that differ by one or two nucleotides from the wild-type sequence in the population. It is further suggested that each viral RNA population of 10
 <sup>9</sup> or more infectious particles was always a mixture of various variants despite being isolated from a single clone [
