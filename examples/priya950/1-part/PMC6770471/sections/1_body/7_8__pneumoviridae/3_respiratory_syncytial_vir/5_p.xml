<p>Larsen et al. analyzed the nucleotides coding for the extracellular part of the G glycoprotein and the full SH protein of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) from several outbreaks from the same herd in different years in Denmark. Identical viruses were isolated within a herd during outbreaks but viruses from recurrent infections were found to vary up to 11% in sequences even in closed herds. It is possible that a quasispecies variant of BRSV persisted in some of the calves in each herd and this persistent variant displayed high viral fitness and became dominant. However, based on the high level of diversity, the most likely explanation is that BRSV was reintroduced into the herd prior to each new outbreak. These findings are highly relevant to understand the transmission patterns of BRSV among calves [
