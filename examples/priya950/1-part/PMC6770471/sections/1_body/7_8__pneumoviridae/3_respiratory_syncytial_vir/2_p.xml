<p>Palivizumab (PZ) is the sole humanized monoclonal antibody against an infectious disease that recognizes the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Zhao et al. selected a PZ resistant virus by passaging of RSVA2 strain in the presence of PZ in HEp-2 cell culture [
 <xref rid="B136-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Utilization of PZ provided the opportunities to gain new insights into the transmission dynamics and the quasispecies nature of RSV. Protein sequence analysis of a single plaque (MP4) isolated from the fifth passage revealed the substitution of lysine by methionine 272. The mutation caused the cell culture-derived virus to be completely resistant to PZ prophylaxis in cotton rats. Dramatic reduction in replication of the parental strain A2 virus was observed at PZ concentrations ranging from 4 to 40 µg/mL. The replication of the MP4 mutant was not affected by PZ. The growth kinetics of both the parental strain and the variant were almost similar with maximum titers above 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU/mL during the third and fourth day post infection. Hence, it was proposed that the fusion protein supported the entry of the MP4 mutants in HEp-2 cells in an early phase of the replication cycle through a fusion step. The A2 parental strain exhibited limited growth in HEp-2 cells due to its reactivity with PZ. However, the lack of reactivity of the MP4 mutants with PZ suggested that the F1 protein of the MP4 mutant caused a loss of antigenic reactivity with the humanized monoclonal antibody. Preclinical studies in cotton rats predicted the efficacy of PZ in humans. However, the usage of PZ up to 40 µg/mL, especially in immunosuppressed patients, could provide opportunities for the emergence of resistant viruses. Therefore, the PZ resistant viruses in humans could cause the PZ prophylaxis to be ineffective.
