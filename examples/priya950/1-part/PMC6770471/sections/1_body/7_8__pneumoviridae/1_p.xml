<p>The 
 <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> family contains large enveloped negative-sense RNA viruses. Previously, this taxon was known as a subfamily of the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> but it was reclassified in 2016 as a family of its own with two genera, 
 <italic>Orthopneumovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Metapneumovirus</italic>. Some viruses belonging to 
 <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> family are only pathogenic to humans, such as the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Human pneumoviruses do not have animal reservoirs and their primary site of infection is the superficial epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. There are no known vectors for pneumoviruses and transmission is thought to be primarily by aerosol droplets [
