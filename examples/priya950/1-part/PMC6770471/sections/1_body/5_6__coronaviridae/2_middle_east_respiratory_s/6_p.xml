<p>Scobey et al. reported the T1015N mutation in the spike glycoprotein during 9 passages of the virus was able to alter the growth kinetics and plaque morphology in vitro. The mutated MERS-CoV virus (MERS-CoV T1015N) replicated approximately 0.5 log more effectively and formed larger plaques compared to the wild type (MERS-CoV). The data suggested that the mutation T1015N was a tissue culture-adapted mutation that arose during serial in vitro passages [

The whole genome sequencing of MERS-CoV revealed the presence of sequence variants within the isolate from dromedary camels (DC) which indicated the existence of quasispecies present within the animal. A single amino acid (A520S) was located in the receptor-binding domain of the MERS-CoV variant. Strikingly, when detailed population analysis was performed on samples recovered from human cases, only clonal genomic sequences were reported. Therefore, the study speculated that a model of interspecies transmission of MERS-CoV whereby specific genotypes were able to overcome the bottleneck selection. While host susceptibility to infection is not taken into account in this setting, the findings provided insights into understanding the unique and rare cases of human of MERS-CoV [
