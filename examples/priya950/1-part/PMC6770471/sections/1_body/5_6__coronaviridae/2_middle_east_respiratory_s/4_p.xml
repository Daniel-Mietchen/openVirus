<p>Lu et al. isolated a diverse population comprising the wild-type and a variant carrying a deletion of 530 nucleotides in the spike glycoprotein gene from the serum of a 75-year-old patient in Taif, Saudi Arabia. The patient subsequently died. Analysis of the MERS-CoV sequence showed an out of frame deletion which led to the loss a large part of the S2 subunit. It contained all the major structures of the membrane fusion in the S2 subunit preceding the early stop codon [
 <xref rid="B103-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] and this also included the proposed fusion peptide (949–970 aa) [
 <xref rid="B104-ijms-20-04657" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. The deletion resulted in the production of a shortened protein bearing only 801 amino acids. In the cell-free serum sample of the patient, mutant genomes with the S530Δ were abundant with an estimated ratio of 4:1 deleted to intact sequence reads. The spike gene deletion would cause the production of a defective virus which was incapable of causing infections or with a lowered rate of infection. Losing the S2 subunit caused a disruption in the membrane holding the spike protein and halted the fusion of the virus to the host. However, in the case of the mutant bearing the S530Δ, the mutation helped to sustain the wild-type MERS-CoV infection by producing a free S1 subunit with a “sticky” hydrophobic tail and the additional disulfide bonds caused the aggregation and mis-folding of proteins. In addition, the mutated S530Δ could form steady trimer complexes that retained biding affinity for the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and acted as a decoy such that the spike-specific MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were blocked.
