<p id="Par6">We fitted our model to the cumulative new infection data from each of six islands of French Polynesia (Tahiti, Sous-le-vent, Moorea, Tuamotu-Gambier, Marquises, Australes) and Yap island. We first estimated five parameters along with their respective standard errors (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). With these parameters, the model simulations exhibited reasonable agreement with the data (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). However, as we can observe from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the standard errors for the estimated parameters are very large, giving a negative lower limit of 95% confidence intervals. The reason for the large standard errors could be that the data may not have enough information to estimate all five parameters and/or the model solution,

 </sup>. This uncertainty embedded in larger confidence intervals can be reduced by using less number of free parameters during data fitting process. As successfully implemented in many previous studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>, the number of free parameters can be reduced without violating the significance of data-fitting by fixing the parameter which has the least impact on the model solution. To use the similar technique, we computed the sensitivity matrix (see “Methods” section), which allowed us to identify parameters that can be fixed and obtain reasonably smaller confidence intervals without violating the significance of data-fitting.
