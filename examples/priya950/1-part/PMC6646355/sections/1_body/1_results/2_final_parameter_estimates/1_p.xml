<p id="Par9">As identified above, the given island data sets allow us to estimate three parameters for Tahiti, S-L-V, Moorea, T-G, Marquises, Australes, and two parameters for Yap with a reasonable confidence interval. Note that the parameters that can be estimated from these data set with a reasonable confidence interval differ from island to island. The final parameters obtained for each island along with their 95% confidence intervals are given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The standard errors across all 7 islands have significantly decreased in our final estimates (see Supplementary Fig.
