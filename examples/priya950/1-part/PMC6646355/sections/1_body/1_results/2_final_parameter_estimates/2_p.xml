 </sup>. In each island, we found that increasing the number of free parameters did not improve the statistical significance of the model fitting (p-value &gt; 0.05 in each case). This shows that choosing the fixed parameters in a way as done in our case provides smaller confidence intervals without violating the significance of the data-fitting. With the final estimated parameters, the model prediction along with the survey data for each island is shown in Fig.
