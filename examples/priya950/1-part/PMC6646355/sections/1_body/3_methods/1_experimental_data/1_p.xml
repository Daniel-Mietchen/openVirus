<p id="Par29">In this study, we utilized the published data containing number of suspected ZIKV infections from six main regions (Tahiti, Iles Sous-le-vent, Moorea, Tuamotu-Gambier, Marquises, and Australes) of French Polynesia, reported weekly between October 2013 and March 2014

 </sup>. In the ZIKV outbreak data of French Polynesia, clinical cases were defined as suspected cases if they were presented to health practitioners with rash and/or mild fever and at least two of the following signs: conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and edema. In total, 8,744 suspected cases were reported from the health sentinel sites. Similarly, in the Yap Island data, researchers reviewed medical records and conducted prospective surveillance at the hospital and all four health centers on Yap to identify patients with suspected ZIKV disease

 </sup>. Suspected cases had the following characteristics: acute onset of generalized macular or papular rash, arthritis or arthralgia, or nonpurulent conjunctivitis. Out of the total 1,276 households tested on Yap Island, 185 cases were identified as suspected ZIKV disease, which we extrapolated for the whole population of Yap Island. We obtained population data for these Islands from the 2012 French Polynesia Census
