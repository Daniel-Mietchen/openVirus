<p id="Par32">Since the death due to ZIKV was not reported during the period of epidemics, we have ignored disease death rate terms in the model. We also consider a closed population (i.e. a population with no births, deaths or continual immigration), since the mean human lifespan is much longer than the outbreak duration, and entry and exit of people inside the island are negligible during this short period of the outbreak. We assumed all people transmitted at the same rate, regardless of whether they displayed symptoms or were reported as cases. We considered that no transmission typically occurs before the exposed individuals enter the infectious class.</p>
