<p id="Par5">The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether data collected from various islands contain information to estimate all the parameters related to ZIKV. For this, we formulated mathematical models of transmission dynamics of ZIKV infection and employed complex-step derivative based sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters that can be estimated from a given limited data. In particular, we used a standard and well-known least square based inverse problem formulation to estimate the parameters. We then performed sensitivity analysis using the relatively unknown and accurate ‘complex-step’ derivative approximation technique to compute sensitivities and standard errors. Using our method, we identified the estimable ZIKV related parameters that can be more confidently estimated from the survey data from six islands of French Polynesia and one island of the Federated States of Micronesia (weekly new infected population). Our techniques allowed us to estimate some ZIKV-related parameters with reasonable confidence intervals. Using these estimated parameters, we computed the basic reproduction number and performed model analysis to study the disease dynamics as well as the effect of prevention programs on disease outcomes.</p>
