<p id="Par28">The main goals of this study were to gain deeper insight into the epidemiological parameters of ZIKV transmission and to evaluate appropriate prevention strategies. The results identified the importance of the information contained in the data in estimating the ZIKV related parameters from the available limited data. This work offered novel insights into ZIKV related parameters as well as ZIKV infection dynamics and effect of prevention programs on disease outcomes, which might be useful for developing ideal prevention and control strategies.</p>
