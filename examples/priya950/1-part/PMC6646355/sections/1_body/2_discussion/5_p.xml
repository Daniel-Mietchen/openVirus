<p id="Par26">Our investigation on prevalence and infection provided some valuable implications to ZIKV epidemics. The prevalence started to increase at the beginning and reached its peak in between 8 to 10 weeks of the outbreak (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Then, it gradually decreased since more humans were recovering from the virus than those with the new ZIKV infections. Our study found that almost 100% of the island people were infected during the outbreak and the result is consistent with the other studies

 </sup>. Since mosquito bite is the main reason for disease transmission, our result showed that reducing the human and mosquito contact could create a safe environment. Reducing the contact about 60% between human and mosquito can drastically reduce both peak prevalence and final outbreak size and almost eradicate the ZIKV infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The outcome is almost identical with the reduction of the mosquito lifespan (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The disease can completely be exterminated by lowering the mosquito lifespan by a factor of 3 to 4 times its base case. We note that the evaluation of these prevention programs was based on the sensitivity of prevention-related model parameters. Further evaluations with detailed models and the data related to the prevention programs are necessary before recommending these programs to practical applications.
