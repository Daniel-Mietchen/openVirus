<p id="Par15">There are no reliable statistics on the actual incidence or prevalence of influenza-related ARDS in either pediatric or adult populations. However, it is known that the vast majority of ARDS is caused by bacterial sepsis and non-infectious etiologies such as trauma, pancreatitis, smoke inhalation, and drug toxicity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Observational studies suggest that within the small proportion of viral-induced ARDS in the pediatric population, most are caused by respiratory syncytial virus and Influenza A, while Influenza A is the predominant viral etiology of ARDS in the adult population [

A European cohort from the Eurosurveillance showed that the risk factors independently associated with ARDS in patients diagnosed with influenza are age between 36 and 55 years old, pregnancy, and obesity, while protective factors associated with ARDS were female sex, influenza vaccination, and infections with Influenza A (H3N2) or Influenza B viruses. Notably, the only factors that remained significantly associated with death were increasing severity score and age greater than 55 years old [

In another cohort from China, it appears that viral strain was a significant factor, as, compared to H1N1, ARDS caused by H7N9 was associated with higher disease severity, higher rates of mechanical complications and hospital-acquired pneumonias, and increased mortality [
