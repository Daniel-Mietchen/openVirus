<p id="Par7">The ferret has traditionally been used as a model of influenza transmission as most human influenza viruses do not need any adaptation to infect and transmit among ferrets. Studies in ferrets have identified the soft palate as a major source of influenza viruses that are transmitted between individuals. Notably, the soft palate is enriched in Î±2,6-linked sialic acids, which are preferred by the hemagglutinin proteins currently found in circulating human influenza viruses [
