<p id="Par17">The immune response to influenza shares many common pathways with the response to bacteria, thus it should not be surprising that an influenza virus infection can have a very similar clinical presentation to bacterial sepsis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Specifically, several studies have demonstrated that both Toll-like receptors 2 and 4, which are the main receptors for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, are also related to influenza pathogenicity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The inflammatory response also varies according to the viral strain; for example, H5N1 virus produces a stronger response than H1N1pdm09 virus and H7N7 in blood macrophages, but H1N1pdm09 produces a more robust cytokine production than other strains [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In addition, similar to bacterial sepsis, endothelial damage and microvascular permeability changes leading to tissue edema and organ failure have been observed with influenza virus infections [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Adults with severe influenza-induced organ failure and pediatric patients with high PIM scores and acute renal failure have a greater risk of mortality [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In the recent 2017 winter season with the predominant H3N2 virus strain, an Australasian study reported that the ICU admission for sepsis was much higher than expected, which the authors attributed in part to the influenza virus season [
