<p id="Par13">Targeting host inflammation has been of increasing interest for the development of new therapeutics for severe influenza. One study used the well-characterized mTOR inhibitor rapamycin/sirolimus to suppress inflammation, leading to improved outcomes, correlated with reduced inflammasome activity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Targeting the mTOR pathway as a means to reduce inflammation and promote recovery implicates host metabolism in the etiology of severe influenza disease, given the central role mTOR plays in nutrient sensing. Metabolic disruptions have been noted in local and systemic analyses of severe cases of influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and metabolic interventions have been shown to alter host response profiles in ways that could be protective or harmful depending on the infection context. For example, in mouse models of bacterial sepsis or influenza virus infection, glucose restriction had opposing effects, protecting against bacterial sepsis but exacerbating influenza-associated disease [

The role of metabolism in modulating viral infection is complex, as while the host needs particular nutrients to support its immune activities, the virus itself requires significant host cell metabolic resources to maintain its replication, including glucose and glutamine [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Targeting these viral metabolic requirements may open additional therapeutic windows. Additionally, the global metabolic state within a host has been shown to have profound effects on the course of viral infection and the progression to ARDS-phenotypes. Obese animals and humans are significantly more susceptible to severe influenza, with increase in lung injury and sustained viral replication, indicative of failures of host immunity and potentially increased viral pathogenesis. The mechanisms relating to obesity to susceptibility are likely complex and multi-factorial, including increased inflammation and decreased wound healing in obese individuals. Additionally, obesity dampens some features of adaptive immunity that may delay viral clearance or increase susceptibility to initial infection [
