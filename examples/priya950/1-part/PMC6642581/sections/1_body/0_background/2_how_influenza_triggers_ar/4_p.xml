<p id="Par12">Other approaches to address the host response directly rather than solely focusing on the virus have included targeting innate immune pathways that amplify inflammatory signals and contribute to epithelial damage. The inflammasome, an innate signaling complex that is required for IL-1Î² and IL-18 secretion has been implicated in multiple studies as influenza-associated pathology [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Suppressing inflammasome activation later in infection, by targeting NLRP3 (a key component of inflammasome signaling) downstream of influenza has had positive effects on recovery in animal models [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Following inflammasome activation, secondary cytokine and chemokine signaling can lead to the recruitment of tissue-damaging neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte populations. Experiments blocking CXCR1/2 signaling, a key receptor pathway necessary for neutrophil recruitment to the site of inflammation showed protection in murine infections with influenza,

Neutrophils can mediate tissue damage by secreting high levels of tissue remodeling enzymes such as MMPs, but also amplify inflammation by secreting extracellular traps (NETs). In mouse models, NETs were highly correlated with acute lung injury, which could be exacerbated by shifting cellular infiltrates in favor of neutrophils by depleting macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similar NET structures have been observed in humans suffering from severe influenza disease. In one study of severe H7N9 and H1N1pdm09 virus infection, levels of NETs at admission were correlated with clinical scores (APACHE II) [
