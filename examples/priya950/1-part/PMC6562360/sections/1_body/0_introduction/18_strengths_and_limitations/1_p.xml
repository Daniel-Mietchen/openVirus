<p>Antigen choice is important, DENV neutralizing epitopes are comprised of complex conformational structures and not recapitulated by simple linear peptides or recombinant proteins (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) utilized fluorescently labeled Vero cell supernatant as well as dual labeled probes to decrease background (
