<p>Transformation efficiency for BCL-6+BCL-XL is 60â€“80% in humans (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), and EBV transformation have improved from 10 to &gt;30% with the addition of TLR agonists, typically CpG or R848 (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). This approach requires significant numbers of cells to yield few cells of interest. Because cells proliferate with this approach, frequency of particular antigen-specific MBCs cannot be enumerated.
