<p>Over several decades, methods to interrogate antigen-specific MBCs have had several useful functions: identifying subset of MBCs available to respond to repeat infections (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), tracking MBCs prior to and after vaccination or booster (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), isolating and characterizing human mAbs following natural infection or vaccination (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and analyzing memory-derived antibody repertoires (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Only recently have these methods been employed in the DENV field. Here we review the leading approaches for characterizing human DENV MBCs, evaluating their strengths, limitations and potential for further contribution to the field (summarized in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
