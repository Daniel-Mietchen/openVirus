<p>The use of hybridomas to immortalize MBCs was first described over 40 years ago (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Hybridomas are made by fusing a myeloma cell with a B-cell from an immunized or naturally infected individual, the resulting hybrid cell secretes mAbs specific to their antigen. Technical advances have made it feasible to generate hybridomas from human peripheral blood MBCs (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) to 0.43% (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) which enabled them to isolate neutralizing mAbs against RSV and influenza from human peripheral MBCs. Hybridoma technology is a well-established and indispensable platform for generating high-quality mAbs and has been used to produce mAbs against a wide range of viral antigens including DENV.
