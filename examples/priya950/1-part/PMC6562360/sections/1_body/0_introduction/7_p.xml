<p>Analyses of human antibody response to DENV infection have traditionally characterized serum antibodies, a product of LLPCs through virus neutralization, binding, and enhancement assays (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, complex, studying individual and population MBCs and the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) they produce is an area of critical importance. Such studies allow for better understanding of the nature of human immune response to pathogens such as DENV, and are expected to lead to more rationally designed vaccines.
