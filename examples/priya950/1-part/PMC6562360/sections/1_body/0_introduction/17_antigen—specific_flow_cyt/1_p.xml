<p>Flow cytometry-based approaches have been used to enumerate antigen specific MBCs against model antigens in mice (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) and humans (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, viral antigen-specific flow cytometry has been utilized more recently, Weitkamp et al. (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) identified human rotavirus specific B-cells, Scheid et al. (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) characterized low-frequency HIV specific MBCs in humans and Woda et al. (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and Appanna et al. (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) used fluorescently labeled whole DENV virus (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) as a probe to detect DENV-specific MBCs in immune donors while Cox et al. (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) used biotinylated DENV envelope protein as a probe along with dual labeled streptavidin antibodies to identify DENV envelope-specific MBCs. This method enabled researchers to isolate 8 DENV-neutralizing mAbs from a single donor (
