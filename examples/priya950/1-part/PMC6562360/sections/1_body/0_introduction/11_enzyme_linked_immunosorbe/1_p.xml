<p>Provides a sensitive and specific tool to detect antigen-specific MBCs. First described over 35 years ago (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) as a method for quantifying rare B and T cells and is still widely used today, as it is sensitive enough to detect a single antigen-specific cell. Plasmablasts can be studied directly 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic>, but MBCs must be stimulated to become antibody-secreting cells. Membrane-bound antigen enables binding of mAbs secreted by B-cells. Bound antibody is detected using a secondary antibody and a colorimetric substrate, resulting in colored spots on the membrane that can be easily enumerated using imaging software. Advances in ELISpot technology have allowed researchers to detect different isotypes of MBCs that recognize multiple epitopes and multiple antigens (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). This allows researchers to determine serotype specificity on a single-cell basis, rather than polyclonal level.
