<p>Neutralizing antibody responses play a critical role in anti-viral immunity–controlling and preventing infection, and are an important aim of vaccination. During initial infection, naïve host B-cells, specific to the infecting antigen, proliferate and differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts that secrete antibodies at a high rate to combat the existing infection. Following viral clearance, two distinct layers of humoral immunity remain to protect against repeat infection with the same antigen—antibodies in the sera, constitutively produced by long lived plasma cells (LLPCs) and memory B-cells (MBC) primed to expand and secrete antibodies upon antigen re-exposure.</p>
