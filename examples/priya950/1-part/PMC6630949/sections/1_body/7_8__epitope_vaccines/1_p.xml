<p>Epitope-based vaccines can serve both immune refocusing role as well as targeting integral virus specific epitopes. Remarkable work inspired by the stabilization of respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein (F) has shown that the relatively conserved HA stem could induce broadly neutralizing antibodies that are protective in mice and non-human primates against several virus subtypes harboring group I HAs (H1, H2, H5, and H9) and group 2 HAs (H3 and H7) [

 <xref rid="B56-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In order to characterize an epitope of limited variability that are located on the HA head, Thompson et al observed that sera collected from young children during a pandemic revealed a cross-reactivity pattern to historical influenza A (H1N1) isolates [

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>-expressed artificial recombinant protein consisting the concatenation of nine linear epitopes (five of which are specific to HA; three, to NP and one, to M1) of several influenza virus strains, and this vaccine has been shown to induce both cellular and humoral immunity in mice and it is envisaged as able to overcome high virus mutation rates [
