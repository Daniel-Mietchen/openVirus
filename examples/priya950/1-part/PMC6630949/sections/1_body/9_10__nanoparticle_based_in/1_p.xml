<p>Continued efforts to develop a universal influenza vaccine has driven the use of self-assembling monomeric ion-carrier molecules, called Ferritin for administration of multivalent vaccine constructs. In vivo assessment of nanoparticle-based vaccines displaying multivalent HA from 8 diverse strains of H1N1 influenza A viruses, were shown to induce broadly protective antibodies in mice, whose protection spanned strains from 1918 through 2009. The breadth of protection by the nanoparticle-induced antibodies were also shown to be more profound in comparison to the individual components of the conventional multivalent vaccine [

Intranasal administration of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticle conjugated to influenza A (H1N1) conserved peptides as a vaccine were also shown to induce protection in the lungs of pigs, via the induction of antigen-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [

 <sup>+</sup> and antibody responses in mice; this was separately challenged with either viruses (i.e., H1N1 and Ebola) or a parasite (

Recently, a double-layered protein nanoparticle developed using tandem expressed M2e (comprising human, avian, swine, and domestic fowl), with or without recombinant HA stalk proteins from H1 and H3, showed homosubtypic and heterosubtypic protection in mice that were immunized prior to challenge with specific influenza A viruses [
