<p>Several approaches have been tried in order to generate attenuated viruses using reverse genetics technology. A suggested technique to downregulate viral protein synthesis is via biased virus codon sequences. Average codon frequency alteration can result in attenuation of virus in mice models, as shown by Fan et al., suggestive that the avian codon–biased vaccine candidate that was fitter in eggs, is good news for generation of influenza vaccines in eggs [

 <xref rid="B50-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This platform has also paved way for the generation of single-cycle replicating influenza viruses as vaccine candidates and have shown similar or higher protection than the conventional LAIV [

 <xref rid="B53-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The main reasons synthetic influenza vaccines remain promising is due to their ability to alter viral immunomodulatory traits and their amenability to rapid production of vaccines.
