<p>Due to continued burden of infection with influenza, the US CDC advocates the use of seasonal influenza vaccines in all persons &gt;6 months prior to the winter [

On the other hand, the WHO extends recommendations for the use of influenza vaccination in the persons categorized as high-risk, which comprises children &gt;6 months, persons with chronic diseases, pregnant women, and healthcare and nursing workers [
 <xref rid="B33-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, in some parts of the world, mostly Africa and Asia, there are either limited or no established influenza vaccination policies. Thus, restricted availability of influenza vaccines makes vaccinations quite uncommon to these populations. Perhaps, such vaccination policies might not have been considered due to the cost of acquiring vaccines annually or still, the reduced efficacy of the influenza vaccines, as have been critically assessed by Xu et al., where recommendations have been made for twice-dose vaccination due to frequencies of seasonal influenza occurrences, all year round [
 <xref rid="B34-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although poor vaccine coverage in African countries was previously reported by Duque et al., upon investigation on the availability of seasonal influenza vaccines, there are still no clearly underpinned core reasons [
 <xref rid="B35-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, the improved efficacy of influenza vaccines would also contribute to enhanced vaccine coverage in Africa and Asia.
