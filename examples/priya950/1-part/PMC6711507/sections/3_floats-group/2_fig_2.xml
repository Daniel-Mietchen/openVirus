  <title>Timeline of the dengue incidence in humans in the year 2010.</title>
  <p>It compares the reported dengue cases to simulation results. 1:1.0, 1:1.5, 1:2.0, 1:2.5, and 1:3.0 refer to simulations with different human:mosquitoes ratios during raining season. The human:mosquito ratio describes the number of mosquitoes depending on the number of humans. This allows us to change the number of humans in the model without the need to change the number of mosquitoes, e.g., for scaling the model. The calibration result refers to the simulation with the calibrated parameters.</p>
