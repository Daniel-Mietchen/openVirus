<p>The contact module handles the spread of dengue virus due to mosquito bites. Other contacts, for example, person-to-person interactions are not relevant for dengue. Only female mosquitoes bite, following a sophisticated process based on their gonotrophic cycle and the need to suck a certain amount of blood. In short, mosquitoes need to bite several persons each day to get a predefined amount of blood for a certain amount of time defined as biting time. When they reach a certain amount of blood, they can lay eggs again. The time between laying eggs, comprising the time of biting and collecting blood, is called gonotrophic cycle. The mosquitos choose their victims randomly among all persons.</p>
