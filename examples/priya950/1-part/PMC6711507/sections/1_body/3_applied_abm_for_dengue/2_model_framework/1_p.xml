<p>In this case study, we aimed to examine the 2010 dengue outbreak in Cebu City in the Philippines. We assessed the impact of potential effectiveness of interventions to control the relative growth of the mosquito population on the number of new dengue infections in humans over time. We simulated dengue for a one-year time horizon throughout the whole year 2010 in Cebu City with a population of 860,942 people. The model is based on a recently published theoretical framework using a modular structure [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our ABM consists of two types of agents: persons and mosquitoes that are simulated over an annual time horizon considering daily time steps. Hypothetical efficacy of interventions was modeled in scenarios that reduce the human mosquito ratio to 1:3.0, 1:2.5, 1:2, 1:1.5 and 1:1 during rainy season. Reported model outcomes are prevalence and incidence of infected humans over time. All results for humans can be further stratified by age, gender, and status of the person (susceptible, infectious, and resistant).
