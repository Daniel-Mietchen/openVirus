<p>To model dengue epidemics, several modeling approaches have been applied. For example, differential equations models are used to predict the outcome of vaccinations [

 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, differential equations models are inflexible because incorporation of details would require a high (and potentially unmanageable) number of disease compartments. Sitepu et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] predicted dengue epidemics using a statistical autoregressive model. However, such statistical methods are limited to specific scenarios and do not incorporate dynamic effects. Several compartment and stochastic simulation models have been applied to predict the impact and cost-effectiveness of Dengvaxia, the first available dengue vaccine [

 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A recent review of health economic evaluation studies of dengue vaccines found that out of 13 studies, 8 studies used dynamic mathematical models of dengue transmission, and 2 studies used a Markov model [
