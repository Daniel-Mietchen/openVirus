 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] note that some modeling methods for decision-analytic models in communicable diseases, such as Markov state-transition cohort models, ignore the indirect effects that arise from averted incident infections, and therefore benefits and cost-savings from the intervention may be underestimated [

 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the review of Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the authors summarize that model choice for cost-effectiveness analyses for vaccination programs need to be improved, for instance, to capture the effect of herd immunity. Jit and Brisson [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] state that many published decision-analytic modeling studies in infectious diseases do not take into account the specific features of infectious diseases such as the transmissibility from infected to susceptible individuals and the uncertainties arising from complex natural history and epidemiology.
