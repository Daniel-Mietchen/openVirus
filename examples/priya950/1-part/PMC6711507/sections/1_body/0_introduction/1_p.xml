<p>Decision analysis is a systematic approach to decision making under uncertainty [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The application of decision-analytic models (i.e. simulation models) allows the evaluation of new technologies (e.g., treatments, vaccinations, interventions against the spread of the disease) with respect to benefits, risks, harms and costs. Such computer simulation models are necessary where randomized controlled clinical trials or observational studies are missing, or not feasible [

Decision-analytic models (DAM) synthesize available information from various sources (e.g., epidemiological studies on the natural history of the disease or the spread of the disease, short-term clinical studies on treatment effects, quality of life studies, expert opinions) for their short- and long-term evaluations [
