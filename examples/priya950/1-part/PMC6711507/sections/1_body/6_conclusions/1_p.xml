<p>ABM is a powerful tool to support decision-analyses for infectious diseases including the dynamics of infectious diseases and emerging behavior, and with a high level of reusability due to modularity. Conceptualizing an ABM, the level of required detail should carefully be considered based on research questions to define a reasonable complexity. The ability to include human behavior or the behavior of other agents makes assumptions explicit, accessible for discussion but may also lead to extensive calibrations due to a lack of data. The complexity of ABM and the underlying structure often requires longer modeling, validation and simulation time. Models can become very data intense. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis can be challenging because of required information on parameter correlation and long simulation time because of the combination of first- and second-order uncertainty. Our case example illustrates that intense calibration efforts may lead only to reasonable reproducibility of reality. The focus of future research should be on model calibration and validation.</p>
