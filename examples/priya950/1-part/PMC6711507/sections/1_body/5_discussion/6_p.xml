<p>Compared to other modeling approaches, ABM also has limitations. ABM usually requires longer development time due to complexity. Because ABM are individual based, one faces longer simulation time, lack of analytical tractability, and challenges in parameterization [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. For example, often there is a lack of studies on contact pattern or frequencies. Therefore, models require extensive calibration efforts for unknown parameters. However, these unknown parameter are made explicit and therefore they become accessible for discussions. Emergent behavior is both an advantage and a weakness of agent-based models. It allows simulating complex and even counterintuitive dynamics. However, the cause of wrong dynamics as a result of erroneous or incomplete agent’s behavior are hard to detect. Therefore, Klügl [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] presents a validation approach specifically for agent-based models that should help to detect such problems. Marshall et al. discuss a new dimension of sensitivity analyses, that is added and may be challenging in ABM: testing the assumptions about human behavior (e.g., “how people learn, how they disseminate information to their peers or families, and how they change their behavior in response to new information, incentives, or penalties”) in ABM [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Chattwahl and He [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] discuss challenges of probabilistic sensitivity analyses due to transmission and network-related parameters that are correlated. In addition, probabilistic sensitivity analysis can require long simulation time because of the combination of first- and second-order uncertainty. Value of information analysis to discover parameters of future research would also be computational very intense. Modeling an open cohort leads to the question of how outcomes are summarized. For example, within a cost-effectiveness analysis of vaccinations of newborns one could consider the outcome (e.g., health-related quality of life) for the entire population over a fixed time horizon or the outcome summarized for people that have at least a follow up time of ten years. Finally, as with all complex models, visualization of ABM with respect to the several modules or layers (development of population, disease, contacts) could be challenging.
