<p>In our individual-level ABM, dengue epidemics are rapidly evolving and the mosquito population is changing fast due to a short lifespan, requiring detailed states of humans and mosquitoes for age, infection, incubation, viraemia, and recovery. Implementing multiple characteristics and disease history can easily be achieved for simulated individuals through combination of attributes. Such a complexity would require hundreds of compartments (i.e., for all combinations of attributes) and thousands of equations when using different aggregated compartments.</p>
