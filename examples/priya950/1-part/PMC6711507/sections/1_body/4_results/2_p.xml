<p>The impact of potential mosquito control strategies on the number of new infections per week is displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221564.g002">Fig 2</xref>, it shows that a reduced human-mosquito ratio of 1:2.5 and 1:3 leads already to a substantial decrease of infected humans and smaller epidemics. Assuming a human mosquito ratio of 1:2 or smaller, the negative trend (i.e., decrease of new infections) during week 1 to 25 continues also during rainy season until the infection numbers reach zero. If a future intervention can reduce the ratio to 1:1 (i.e., number of mosquitoes does not increase during rainy season), the dengue epidemic eventually dies out. (see also
