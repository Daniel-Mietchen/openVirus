<p>Reaction volume was 20 µL, which contained 5 µg RNA template, 25 µM of each primer, and 10 µL KAPA master mixtures (KAPA SYBR® FAST qPCR kit). The samples were initially incubated at 42°C for 30 min for reverse transcription, followed by incubation at 95°C for 3 min for denaturation. In total, 40 cycles were performed, each consisting of a denaturation step at 95°C for 3 s and an annealing at 60°C for RVFV and CHIKV and at 65°C for hantavirus. Negative and positive controls were included for each test to confirm the specificity of the selected primer pairs.</p>
