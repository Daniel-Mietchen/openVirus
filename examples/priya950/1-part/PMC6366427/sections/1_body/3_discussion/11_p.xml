<p>Mosquito-infested areas show high rates of malarial parasite infection. High prevalence of malaria is usually observed in children [
 <xref rid="CIT0049">49</xref>]; however, in this study, most malaria patients were adults (10 patients); however, only three children had malaria positive. The African continent has witnessed a long-term decline in the prevalence of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, malaria burden in the six endemic countries (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen) [
 <xref rid="CIT0050">50</xref>]. PCR is used for identification and characterization of viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents. In particular, RT-PCR is useful for diagnosing the presence of RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0051">51</xref>]. We used RT-PCR to accurately determine the presence of various VHFs, which will enable to get better awareness of outbreaks and timely management of VHF and prevention of new infections. These viruses and the malarial parasite are transmitted via mosquitoes and arthropods, and hence, infected patients should be quarantined. Finally, public health education and awareness campaigns should be initiated (for the public as well as health workers) and mosquito breeding areas should be eradicated to eliminate these pathogens.
