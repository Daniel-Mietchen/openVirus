<p>To date, the role of NK cells was mostly examined in detail for CHIKV infection. Although we and others have shown that NK cells mount an early and efficient protective response following CHIKV infection, their contribution to viral-induced pathology has been reported as well [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A few days after the onset of infection, NK cells display an activated profile [

 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] with increased expression of late-differentiation makers such as CD57, ILT-2 and CD8a. By contrast, expression of immature receptors such as NKG2A and CD161 is decreased together with the activating NKp30 and NKp46 receptors [

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], as has been previously observed in other viral infections [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. More intriguingly, CHIKV infection skews the NK cell receptor repertoire toward expression of the activating CD94/NKG2C receptor, which is usually very poorly or not at all expressed on NK cells of healthy donors. Initially, Guma et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] described a skewing of the NK cell repertoire toward adaptive NK cells that express the activating CD94/NKG2C receptor in HCMV seropositive individuals. Similar observations have been made in the context of CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], Hantavirus [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and viral hepatitis B and C [

 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Until now, the presence and expansion of adaptive NK cells have almost exclusively been associated with prior exposure to HCMV or its reactivation [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This expansion seems partially driven by the increase in expression of HLA-E, the ligand of NKG2C, together with responsiveness of the cells to IL-12 and/or IL-15 [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In addition, several recent studies have demonstrated that sequence variation in peptides presented by HLA-E could affect activation and antibody-driven effector function of adaptive NK cells [

 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Although key questions regarding the regulation and function of adaptive NK cells remain, their expansion is clearly associated with the development of memory NK cells, at least in certain experimental animal models [
