<p>In accordance with the upregulation of MHC class I expression, an increasing number of studies have also reported that flavivirus-infected target cells are unaffected over time, indicating that they are protected from NK cell cytotoxicity. This was shown by us in DENV-2-infected patients [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and by Costa et al. in an optimized humanized mouse model, in which IFN-γ production by human NK cells was found to be important in controlling DENV replication in the absence of cytotoxicity [

 <xref rid="B89-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In another study in Uganda, pre-existing IFN-γ-producing NK cells in an activated immune microenvironment were associated with lower viral loads following vaccination against YFV [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is important to note that an increased number of NK cells was reported in liver biopsies of patients who died of YFV [
