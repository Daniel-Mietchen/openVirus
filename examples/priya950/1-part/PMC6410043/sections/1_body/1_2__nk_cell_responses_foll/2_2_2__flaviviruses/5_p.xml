<p>As in several other human viral infections (e.g., CMV, hantavirus, CHIKV and HIV-1), we observed an early accumulation of NKG2C
 <sup>+</sup> NK cells in association with CD57 following acute infection by DENV-2 in Gabonese patients, in comparison to healthy donors. However, this increase in the frequency of CD57
 <sup>+</sup>NKG2C
 <sup>+</sup> NK cells was transient and a return to normal levels occurred rapidly following the acute phase of infection [

Of note, in other flavivirus infections, such as WNV and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), another flavivirus transmitted to humans by ticks, specific expansion of NKG2C-expressing NK cells was never observed, even in CMV seropositive donors [

 <xref rid="B83-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. It remains possible that NKG2C
 <sup>+</sup> NK cells expanded only locally, such as in the central nervous system in a TBEV infection. Indeed, this has been previously observed in patients with celiac disease, in which intraepithelial T cells in the gut lumen expressed high levels of NKG2C, whereas the corresponding T cells in the periphery remained unaffected [
