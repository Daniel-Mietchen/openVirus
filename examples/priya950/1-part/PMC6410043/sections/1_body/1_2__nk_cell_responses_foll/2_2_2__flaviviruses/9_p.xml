<p>In DENV, ADCC may be also important during secondary infections by another serotype, when serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies to DENV are present; the four DENV serotypes share 70% sequence homology and thus cross-reactivity is common, known to be an underlying mechanism of elevated immune-pathology associated with severe forms of DENV [

 <xref rid="B99-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. This can cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which weakly neutralizing antibodies from the first infection bind to the second serotype and enhance infection of myeloid cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, expressing FcÎ³R, like CD16 expressed by NK cells [

Recently, Sun et al. have reported the importance of NK cell-mediated ADCC to act as the first line of defence against ADE by showing that NK cell activation occurred concomitantly with the detection of ADE, with elevated expression of CD69 and NKp44 on NK cells [
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. In this study, a minimal activation of T cells was observed and it was furthermore shown that the magnitude of ADE in monocytes was up to tenfold increased when NK cells were depleted.
