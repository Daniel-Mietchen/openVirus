<p>There are two mechanisms by which a viral infection can be controlled: limiting the rate of production of new virus particles (by blocking viral entry or preventing the infected cell from releasing virus) or increasing the clearance of infected cells or virus. NK cells can play a role in the clearance of infected cells through antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). In 1984, Kurane et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] reported that NK cell-mediated lysis of Raji cells particles infected with the DV2 serotype was significantly higher when these cells had been preincubated with DV-immune serum. ADCC activity in plasma from school children in Thailand prior to a secondary infection with DENV appeared to correlate with neutralizing Ab titres and immune protection against secondary DENV-3 infection, although such a correlation was not observed with DENV-2 infection [

Polymorphism of CD16a in positions 48 and 158 has been reported to impact human IgG1 binding and ADCC activity and thus need to be examined in patients infected by DENV. Similarly, NK cells control WNV infection by detecting and lysing NS1-expressing-infected cells through ADCC [
