<p>In this review, we sought to illustrate the role of NK cells in the control of arboviral infections. There are however significant limitations in our current understanding of the mechanisms by which human NK cells recognize the different arboviruses and mediate their antiviral function. Additional studies are needed to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which NK cells recognize infected target cells and the nature of the receptor-ligand families that are involved in this process.</p>
