<p>Importantly, during acute infection the quantity of NK cells can significantly decrease in the peripheral blood, suggesting that NK cells are recruited from the periphery to sites of infection, in order to produce cytokines and become cytotoxic. The role of resident and circulating NK cells in the target tissues remains as yet elusive; however, the recent identification of markers specific for human tissue-resident NK cells, such as CD69, CD103 (αE integrin) and CD49 (α1 integrin) [
