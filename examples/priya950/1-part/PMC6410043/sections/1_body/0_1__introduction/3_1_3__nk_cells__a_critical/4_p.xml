<p>The relevance of this recognition is highlighted by mechanisms evolved by viruses to evade the host immune system and diminish expression of stress ligands. This array of receptors also generates a vast diversity in the NK repertoire, arguing that single-cell diversity enhances their ability to fulfil this role. The diversity of the T- or B-cell repertoire is captured in a single antigen receptor, whereas NK cells, by contrast, are diverse at a single-cell level. Consequently, based on the expression of 28 cell surface receptors, the NK cell repertoire is composed of up to 3 Ã— 10
