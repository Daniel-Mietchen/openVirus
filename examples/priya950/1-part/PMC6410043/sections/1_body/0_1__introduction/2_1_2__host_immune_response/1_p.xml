<p>Despite their considerable diversity, mosquito-borne viruses share a common attribute: transmission via the skin at the site of the mosquito bite. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00131-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows that after the bite, the majority of the virus is directly deposited into the extracellular space of the dermis, which represents the first stage of infection. Both DENV and ZIKV have been shown to infect dermal dendritic cells (DCs) and although there are no reports of YFV infecting Langerhans cells, it can nevertheless infect myeloid DCs. Viral entry into susceptible cells during ZIKV infection is mediated by DC-SIGN but appears to be DC-SIGN-independent in the case of DENV and YFV [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00131" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been shown that CHIKV is able to replicate in epithelial and endothelial cells and, to a lesser extent, monocyte-derived macrophages and that viral entry into these cells was mediated by several receptors including prohibitin, phosphatidylserine-mediated virus entry-enhancing receptors and glycosaminoglycans [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00131-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In a zebrafish model, it was shown that CHIKV rapidly disseminates to various organs within approximately 14 h after infection [

During this silent incubation period, the viral load in the circulation increases rapidly to reach a high serum levels of infectious particles. The acute phase of arbovirus infection is accompanied by an early type I interferon (IFN) response [
