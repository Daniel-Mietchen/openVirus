<p>Phylogenetic data from MCC and Densitree, which show the frequency of clades and nodes clustering, demonstrates that all Brazilian ZIKV isolates presented high phylogenetic relationships with several isolates from Central America and the Caribbean region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>), reinforcing this important link for ZIKV spread across the Americas. Our results suggest multiple and simultaneous ZIKV introductions into South America, as shown in the time-scaled MCC phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref>). Intriguingly, however, is a 2014 Haitian ZIKV isolate (GenBank accession number KU509998) clustering with French Polynesian isolates (GenBank accession number KX369547-2013) at the bottom of the tree and from which other South American ZIKV isolates appear to have descended from.
