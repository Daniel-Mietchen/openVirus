<p>Although our data does not match perfectly with the findings of Allicock et al. in 2012 [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] about the original source country of Central America/Caribbean islands, mainly due to the different samples used as well as an inherent sampling bias introduced when analyzing only complete genomes, the general picture holds true showing that those regions are most of the time the first point of entry from which pathogenic arboviruses subsequently spread to the mainland South America. In addition, we also showed that multiple independent entrances occurred from Central American countries and/or Caribbean islands to South America right after reported outbreaks. Perhaps the link between new entrance events and corresponding outbreaks are due to the highest DENV diversity present in the Caribbean region which increases the probability of new variants' emergence into South America. In summary, these introductions altered viral population dynamics in South America as it was observed in the 90s and 2010 (DENV-1 genotype V); in 2009 and 2010 onwards (DENV-2 lineages IIâ€”(AS/AM)); in 1999-2000; in 2010 (DENV-3 BR I, II, and III lineages, Caribbean/South American); and in 2013-2014 (DENV-4 genotypes I and II) in
