<p>Next, we traced the dispersion of DENV-3 lineages (BR-I, BR-II, BR-III, and BR-IV (originating from the Caribbean/South American regions)) to South America. Importation of DENV-3 lineage BR-I into Brazil and Paraguay was from Puerto Rico (highlighted in red) and the BR-II lineage from Trinidad and Tobago (highlighted in green) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>). DENV-3 BR-III (highlighted in blue) and IV (BRA/VEN in bold) lineages were probably imported from the Philippines (KU050695.1 isolated in 1956) and the United States of America (JQ922554.1 isolated in 1963), which explains the Asian and American relationships of the subsequent lineages (

In addition, our analyses suggest that the introduction of the BR-I genotype into South America followed a similar route of DENV-2 with an entry point in Puerto Rico from where it spread to Brazilian states such as São Paulo (southeast), Pará and Rondônia (north), Pernambuco/Maranhão (northeast), and then Paraguay (Asunción and Juan Caballero). Genotypes II and III were introduced from Trinidad and Tobago in the early 2000s, whereas genotype IV was probably introduced into Brazil from Venezuela (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>), we would also suggest the classification of South American I and II (SA-I and II) lineages rather than BR-I and II.
