<p>Clinically, it is often difficult to differentiate DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV infections as they have similar manifestations, which include fever, exanthema, and arthralgia [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During the acute phase of infection, the diseases can be diagnosed and differentiated using molecular methods, such as real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. CHIKV causes a febrile illness characterized by sudden onset, backache, headache, photophobia, and rash; unlike DENV and ZIKV fever, CHIKV infection is associated with high rates of symptomatic infections and with recurrent polyarthralgias, which can be disabling [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. CHIKV has only one serotype, but four viral genotypes have been identified to date (East-Central-South African (ECSA), West African, Asian, and the Indian Ocean lineage (IOL)) [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The disease is caused by four closely related but antigenically distinct serotypes of DENV (DENV-1â€“4). For DENV-1 and DENV-2, five and six genotypes have been described, respectively, whereas DENV-3 and DENV-4 have been subdivided into four genotypes [
