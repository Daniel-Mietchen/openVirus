<p>The Python environment available in the ETE3 programming interface was applied for the analysis and visualization of phylogenomic data [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The presence of a phylogenetic signal was investigated through the likelihood mapping analysis using TREE-PUZZLE v.5.2 (available at: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tree-puzzle.de" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.tree-puzzle.de</ext-link>) [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The Pairwise Homoplasy Index (PHI) test for recombination was conducted with the SplitsTree v.4.10 following the default settings [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The reliability of the nodes was analyzed by Shimodaira-Hasegawa- (SH-) like test support values with 1000 replications [
