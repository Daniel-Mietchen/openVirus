<p>Initially, whole-genome sequences of all ZIKV, CHIKV, DENV-1–4, genotypes, and variants isolated from several countries/regions of North/South/Central America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania collected from 1944 to 2016 (covering a period of 72 years) were retrieved from GenBank in October 2016. Then, sequences were filtered by known location, isolation source, and sampling date (see below). Only whole genome sequences were used instead of specific gene fragments or partial genomes since short sequences have a limited number of genomic locations available for analysis. Specifically, in the context of an epidemic, the amplification of limited genomic regions may not detect mutations that will be informative for the phylogenetic analysis of viral spread. Sequences containing degenerate bases, information such as virus isolated from “unknown hosts” and “laboratory strains,” duplicate sequences, and sequences from clones and recombinants were discarded from our analysis. The six datasets (ZIKV, CHIKV, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) were aligned independently using MUSCLE v3.8.31 [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Each individual alignment was used in subsequent analyses.
