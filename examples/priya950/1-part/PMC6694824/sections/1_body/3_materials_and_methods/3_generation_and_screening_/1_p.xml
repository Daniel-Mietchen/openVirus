The nontargeting guide RNA pair was GTATTACTGATATTGGTGGG and GAACTCAACCAGAGGGCCAA. The guides were cloned into plasmid pSpCas9n(BB)-2A-Puro (PX462) v2.0 (Feng Zhang Lab), obtained via Addgene, and equimolar amounts of plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher). Cells harboring at least one plasmid were enriched by selection with puromycin at 1.5 μg · ml
 <sup>−1</sup> for 3 to 5 days and single-cell sorted into 96-well plates containing growth medium, using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) Aria IIIU (BD Biosciences) with an 85-μm nozzle. Single cells were grown out into clonal populations over a period of 10 to 14 days. Genetic loci harboring insertion/deletion mutations (indels) were amplified by PCR using barcoded primers (AGTGACGGAGTGACTGACTG and GAGGTGAGGCCTACGTTGAT for

 <italic>Anp32B</italic>) (

A total of 268 barcoded amplicons were then prepared for next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the NEBNext Ultra II kit (NEB) and sequenced using 150-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. Reads were mapped using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) v0.7.5. Indels occurring above a cutoff of 2.5% of reads were detected using an R script (
