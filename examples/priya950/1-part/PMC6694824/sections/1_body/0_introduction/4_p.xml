<p>Here, we use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to render the 
 <italic>Anp32A</italic> and/or 
 <italic>Anp32B</italic> genes nonfunctional in low-ploidy human eHAP1 cells (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), thus obtaining a clean experimental platform in which to investigate the interplay between different influenza virus polymerases and mammalian ANP32 proteins. We find that although IAV and IBV polymerases can replicate in the absence of either ANP32A or ANP32B alone (i.e., in single-knockout cells), depletion of both proteins (double knockout) renders the cell impervious to RdRp activity. Furthermore, none of the IAV strains tested is capable of replication in the double knockout cells. Human ANP32A and ANP32B proteins are thus functionally redundant but essential for influenza virus replication. We further show that this redundancy is not present in the murine Anp32 orthologues. Only murine Anp32B (MusB) is able to recover IAV polymerase activity, although, surprisingly, murine Anp32A (MusA) can be coopted by IBV polymerase. Functionality mapped to leucine-rich repeat 5 of the LRR domain, thus assigning this domain of the host proteins as key for the support of influenza polymerase activity and a target for future interventions.
