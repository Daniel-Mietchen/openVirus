<p>Minigenome reporter assays were carried out in single and double ANP32-knockout cells with reconstituted polymerases from three different influenza A viruses—a seasonal H3N2 virus (A/Victoria/3/75), an avian H5N1 virus (A/turkey/England/50-92/1991) with the mammalian-adapting mutation E627K in the PB2 subunit, and a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (A/England/195/2009)—as well as an influenza B virus (B/Florida/04/2006). Surprisingly, absence of ANP32A in human cells did not result in loss of influenza polymerase activity; in fact, activity increased for some polymerase constellations. (
