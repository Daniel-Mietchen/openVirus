<p>In order to confirm redundancy, polymerases were coexpressed in dKO cells with plasmids encoding exogenous ANP32A, ANP32B, or equal amounts of both. All polymerases tested regained activity in the presence of either ANP32 protein (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">d</xref>). Provision of both proteins at once did not further enhance rescue. These results were corroborated at the single-cell level: ANP32A or ANP32B proteins fused to the red fluorescent protein mCherry were coexpressed in dKO cells with H5N1 (PB2 627K) 50-92 vRNP components PB1, PB2-627K, PA-green fluorescent protein (GFP), and NP, with an influenza minigenome encoding blue fluorescent protein (BFP) as a reporter. Blue fluorescence resulting from active polymerase was observed only in cells that expressed ANP32 proteins, and either paralogue was able to rescue activity (
