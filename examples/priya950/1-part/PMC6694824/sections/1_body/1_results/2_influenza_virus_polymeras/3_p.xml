<p>These data demonstrate that ANP32A and ANP32B proteins are essential but redundant for influenza A and B polymerase activity in human cells. Intriguingly, we observed that recovery of polymerase activity in dKO cells was more efficiently achieved by expression of ANP32B than ANP32A for specific polymerase constellations, namely avian H5N1 50-92 (PB2 627K) and IBV Florida 06 (
