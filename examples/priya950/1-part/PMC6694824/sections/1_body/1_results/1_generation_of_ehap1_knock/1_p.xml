<p>eHAP1 cells lacking ANP32A (AKO), ANP32B (BKO), or both proteins (dKO) were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing using a double-nickase approach for enhanced specificity and minimal off-target DNA cleavage (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Control cells (control) were treated in an identical manner with nontargeting guide RNAs (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Two independent clones with diallelic disruption of the 
 <italic>Anp32A</italic> or 
 <italic>Anp32B</italic> locus were verified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing of individual alleles, and loss of protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting against ANP32A or ANP32B, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and data not shown). Double-knockout cells were generated by tandem CRISPR from a BKO clone, using the guides against the 
 <italic>Anp32A</italic> locus. Three independent dKO clones were verified by Sanger sequencing, and loss of expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis (
