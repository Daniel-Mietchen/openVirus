<p>We used the complementation assay in dKO cells to ask whether Anp32 proteins from nonhuman species relevant to influenza virology were capable of supporting polymerase function. We carried out minigenome reporter assays coexpressing Anp32A proteins from pig (SusA), mouse (MusA), duck (AnasA), and chicken (GallusA) with IAV polymerase (H3N2 Victoria/75). While the avian and porcine orthologues could support IAV polymerase, MusA could not (

Bearing in mind that our results suggest that human ANP32B might be the more potent host factor for some polymerase constellations, we hypothesized that in mice, influenza virus might rely solely on MusB to support its replication. Indeed, expression of MusB could recover Vic/75 polymerase activity in dKO cells (
