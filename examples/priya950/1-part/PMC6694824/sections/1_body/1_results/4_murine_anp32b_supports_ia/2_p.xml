<p>An alignment of murine and human ANP32 proteins showed several unique features in the MusA sequence, mapping largely to surface-exposed residues within LRR 5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). In order to determine whether these differences were responsible for the lack of functionality of MusA, we generated a chimera of murine Anp32A and B (MusA
 <sup>128-153</sup>) by substituting a 26-amino acid (aa) segment (aa 128 to 153) of MusB into MusA (
