<p>It has been suggested that ANP32A and ANP32B specifically support the synthesis of negative-sense vRNA from a positive-sense intermediate template (cRNA) (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This is believed to occur after primary transcription in 
 <italic>cis</italic> of the vRNA by the incumbent RdRp and requires newly synthesized RdRp molecules to stabilize the cRNA in 
 <italic>trans</italic> (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Therefore, without replication, secondary transcription and accumulation of viral proteins will not occur. We used immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize accumulation of viral nucleoprotein (NP) in control and dKO cells 5 h postinfection with H1N1 PR8 virus. NP accumulation exceeded background level only in cells containing ANP32 proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), but this approach was not sufficiently sensitive to image NP protein products of primary transcription. In order to assess which viral RNAs were synthesized in cells that lack expression of ANP32 proteins, we preexpressed an inactive influenza polymerase complex (to stabilize any cRNA generated) for 20 h before infecting with high-MOI virus in presence or absence of cycloheximide (CHX). Five hours later, levels of vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA generated from segment 6 of the incoming virus were assayed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In control cells, amplification of all 3 RNA species was evident in the absence of CHX. In dKO cells, RNA levels were not different in presence or absence of CHX, indicating that vRNA was not replicated. Primary transcription of mRNA and pioneering round generation of cRNA (i.e., replication of cRNA from the incoming vRNA by the incumbent 
 <italic>cis</italic> RdRp) were detected in dKO cells, since RNA levels were similar to those detected in the presence of CHX in control cells. Thus, our data support the block to replication occurring at the step of copying cRNA back to vRNA in the absence of ANP32 proteins.
