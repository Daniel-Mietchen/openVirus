<p>Interestingly, the redundancy observed in humans is not observed for murine Anp32 proteins. IAV polymerases cannot use MusA, but IBV polymerase can, albeit inefficiently. The ability of influenza A virus to replicate in mice is explained by the utility of murine Anp32B. Mapping this difference using a chimeric approach revealed LRR 5 as a key domain of ANP32 proteins for supporting IAV polymerase, and point mutation highlighted the role of a single amino acid in LRR 5 at position 130. It will be important to investigate whether this is a contact point in the interaction between the viral complex and the host protein, and this will be a crucial question for structural studies to address. The highlighted domain sits adjacent to a linker region between the structured LRR and highly flexible LCAR, and it may be important for defining overall structural arrangement and susceptibility to conformational change. It is interesting to note that in chicken cells, it is the Anp32A orthologue that is utilized by avian influenza polymerase, whereas chAnp32B does not support replication; this difference in functionality was also mapped to LRR 5 (
