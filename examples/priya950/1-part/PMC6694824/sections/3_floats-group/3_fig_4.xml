  <p>Synthesis of vRNA from the cRNA template is abrogated in cells lacking ANP32A and ANP32B. 
   <bold>(</bold>a) Immunofluorescence analysis for NP expression in control cells, dKO, or mock-infected cells. Cells were infected with H1N1 PR8 virus (MOI = 0.2) for 5 h in growth medium, then fixed and incubated with primary α-IAV NP antibody followed by Alexa Fluor-568 secondary antibody and imaged on a Zeiss Cell Observer widefield microscope. The lower detection limit in the TexasRed channel was set to that of the DAPI channel. (b) qRT-PCR analysis demonstrating accumulation of PR8 virus segment 6 vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA in the absence or presence of 100 μg · ml
   <sup>−1</sup> cycloheximide (CHX). eHAP1 control or dKO cells were transfected with H5N1 Tky/50-92 polymerase components PB1-D446Y (catalytically inactive), PB2-627K, and PA in a 1:1:1 ratio 20 h prior to infection with PR8 virus at an MOI of 10. RNA was extracted 5 h postinfection. Data show mean (SD) of 40-
