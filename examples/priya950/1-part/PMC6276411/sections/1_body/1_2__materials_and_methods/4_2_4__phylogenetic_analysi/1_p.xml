<p>The 5′–UTR genomic sequences obtained were compared with the relevant sequences published in GenBank (

The sequences in this study were trimmed and analyzed with MEGA7.0 software [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to obtain 224 nucleotide sequences, corresponding to the 5′–UTR region of BVDV. The 224 nucleotide sequences were then subjected to alignment using the ClustalW program using MegAlign in the Lasergene 12.0 software (DNASTAR Inc. Madison, WI, USA), and genetic diversity analysis was performed using MEGA7.0 software. The evolutionary distances in the phylogenetic tree were computed using the Tamura 3–parameter model with 1000 bootstrap replicates, each constructed by the Neighbor-Joining method [
