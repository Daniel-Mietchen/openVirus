<p>Among the BVDV–1 types, the most frequent subtype was BVDV–1b (n=5) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Five BVDV–1b-positive samples from different counties of southwestern China shared 98.1%–99.0% identity with each other and had 91.6%–98.0% identity with the reference strain, BVDV–1b 24–15 (AF298060), and Osloss (M96687). Those five strains were also clustered with the two BVDV-1b reference strains (
