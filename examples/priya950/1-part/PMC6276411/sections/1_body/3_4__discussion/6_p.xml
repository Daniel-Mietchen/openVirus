<p>In summary, this study demonstrated that BVDV–1 was a common causative agent for infection of goats in southwestern China and that 17.51% of the detected samples from ill goats were BVDV–1 positive. However, we did not assess samples from the healthy goats and cannot determine the prevalence of BVDV in healthy goats. To further our understanding of the genetic diversity of BVDV strains detected, all antigen-positive samples were confirmed and characterized with RT-PCR as being infected by BVDV–1, but not BVDV–2, BVDV–3, or BDV. Twelve BVDV–1-positive samples were identified from these RT-PCR positive samples and were clustered into the six subtypes BVDV–1a, 1b, 1c, 1m, and 1p. Due to the possibility of cross infections of BVDV that might occur among cattle, piglets, and goats, much more emphasis should be placed on epidemiology surveys in these animals. This is the first description of the genetic diversity of BVDV–1-positive samples collected from goats in southwestern China.</p>
