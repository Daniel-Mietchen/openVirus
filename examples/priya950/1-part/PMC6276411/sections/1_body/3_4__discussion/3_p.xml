<p>The 1b subtype is widely considered to be a major contributor to infection in Chinese cattle [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, BVDV-1b is also a main subtype in Chinese goat herds [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. BVDV transmission among different animal species has been proven and, therefore, increased surveillance of BVDV infection in goats should be an important factor to consider in the control and understanding of BVDV infection in cattle.
