<p>In this study, we identified 12 selected BVDV-1-positive samples that represented different flocks or geographical origins of blood samples collected between 2013 and 2016. Experimental or natural infection in goats has been previously confirmed [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Goats infected with BVDV represent a great risk for disease transmission, thus making the identification of BVDV infection in goats an important endeavor. This investigation described the genetic diversity of BVDV isolated from goats in southwestern China and demonstrated the occurrence of at least five subtypes of BVDV, including BVDVâ€“1a, 1b, 1c, 1m, and 1p.
