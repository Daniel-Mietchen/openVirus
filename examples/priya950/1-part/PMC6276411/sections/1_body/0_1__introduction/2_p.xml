<p>The natural host of BVDV is cattle though it is also capable of infecting sheep, goats, piglets, and other domestic and wild ruminants by persistently infected (PI) animals and transiently infected individuals [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PI cattle are the main source of BVDV; however, persistent infections also occur in nonbovid hosts such as sheep and deer. BVDV infections in goats typically result in reproductive diseases and viable PI goats are rare [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There is increasing evidence that BVDV infections occur in a wider range of species, including mountain goats and domestic goats that have been reservoirs for BVDV infection and seriously impact the domestic livestock industry.
