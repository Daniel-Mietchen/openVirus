<p>Nonstructural proteins have roles during the virus life cycle and directly interact with signaling proteins of the innate immune response. Sironi et al. has emphasized the selective pressures faced by NS1 in flaviviruses and its important functions in viral RNA replication and immune evasion, as seen during the pathogenesis of DENV [

The amino acid differences in NS1 proteins may explain the difference between the virus-host interaction of flaviviruses, and how the host immune response is differentially modulated to viruses such as ZIKV in comparison to DENV. Furthermore, by interacting with host immune components like the RIG-I-like receptors, NS1 proteins have demonstrated a crucial function in flavivirus pathogenesis [
