<p>Among the cellular pathways implicated in development of the brain and regulation of autophagy, Akt-mTOR pathway is hijacked by pathogens to benefit viral replication in host cells. Akt-mTOR pathway has also been identified as a target of ZIKV proteins NS4A and NS4B for neurogenesis inhibition and autophagy induction [
 <xref rid="B105-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. DENV and ZIKV both induce autophagy through NS4 protein in order to suppress Akt-mTOR signaling in the host cell. The suppression of Akt-mTOR signaling pathway leads to an upregulation of autophagy and impaired neurogenesis in the host cell, ultimately resulting in enhanced viral replication. Taken together, the nonstructural proteins of ZIKV work synergistically to restrict host antiviral response at multiple levels and interfere with important cellular survival and homeostasis mechanisms for to evade the host immune system.
