<p>The efficient replication of flaviviruses is associated with the ability of the virus to inhibit the induction of IFNs and downstream signaling pathways. Consequently, viruses employ multiple immune evasion mechanisms to mount an effective countermeasure to the host cell immune response. Nonstructural proteins, for example, interact with molecules involved in innate immunity to establish efficient viral replication. ZIKV infection leads to the inhibition of type I IFN production and downstream interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) [
