<p>Flaviviruses carry out their life cycle by utilizing machinery and functions of the host cell [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consequently, flavivirusâ€“host cell interactions are essential for the pathogenesis. Many of these crucial interactions, however, remain elusive. In this Review, we focus on ZIKV, a member of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, and highlight the viral pathogenesis at the level of cellular mechanisms and interactions.
