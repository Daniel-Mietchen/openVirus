<p>Since the series of outbreaks in 2007, ZIKV infection has increasingly been associated with cases of neurological complications and congenital malformations. Microcephaly, which is defined by a brain size that is at least two standard deviations below the mean, is one clinical presentation of a congenital ZIKV infection, and the World Health Organization has already established an etiological link between ZIKV infection and birth defects like microcephaly in Brazil [

Despite the prevalence of birth defects, diagnosis of congenital microcephaly remains a challenge due to the existence of various etiological factors involved [
