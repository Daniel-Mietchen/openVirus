<p>Infectious diseases have gained importance as a significant threat to public health following the recent outbreaks of arthropod-transmitted viruses (arboviruses) in the western hemisphere. Global emergence of arboviruses such as dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya, yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) has become possible due to several factors including urbanization, rapid population growth, and climate change [

Although environmental changes have given importance to the movement of the human population, especially by air travel, the extent to which humans have reshaped the environment has also led to a dynamic spread of pathogens and their vectors. The dissemination of arboviruses, in particular, is dependent on their vectors, and reports of these pathogens in new global destinations should raise concerns of the expansive distribution of the vectors, such as the

Of the numerous human pathogens that have experienced a rapid geographic distribution, this review focuses on ZIKV, which has raised international health concerns due to its broad spectrum of transmission routes, autoimmune disorders in adults, and neurodevelopmental complications in newborns [

 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. ZIKV belongs to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family along with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and DENV, all of which are medically important viruses transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks. As of January 2018, PAHO has reported 223,477 confirmed ZIKV cases that have cumulated worldwide between 2015 and 2018 [
