<p>In addition to antiviral responses, a virus infection mediates changes in various cellular pathways, including cell survival, death and metabolism. Cell death pathways can be manipulated to benefit either the host by eliminating the pathogen, or the infecting pathogen by eliminating host immune cells [
 <xref rid="B67-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Multiple cell death pathways, such as apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, are utilized by the host and virus, and clearance or persistence of the virus depends on who manipulates the pathway. Crosstalk between different cell death pathways also provides protection for innate immune signaling pathways that are frequently targets of pathogen attacks.
