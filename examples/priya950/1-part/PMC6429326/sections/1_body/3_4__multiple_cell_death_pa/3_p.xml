<p>In Azevedo et al., apoptosis and necrosis were identified as the main pathways of neuronal cell death, resulting from the combined actions of immune factors and the virus [

Immunohistochemistry analysis of brain tissues in Azevedo et al. showed significantly higher expression of NLRP1, NLRP3, and AIM2, cytokines IL-1Î², IL-18, IL-33, and caspase 1 in cases of ZIKV-induced microcephaly, highlighting IL-33 as one of the cytokines that exerts multiple actions in relation to necroptosis, pyroptosis, and activation of inflammasome [

Furthermore, Monel et al. suggests paraptosis as another form of cell death induced by ZIKV infection, during which formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles, which were derived from the endometrium reticulum, were visible in various cell types, including Hela cells, primary human astrocytes, and skin fibroblasts [

It will be interesting to further study an array of virulence factors to modulate host cell death pathways as a component of the survival strategy.
