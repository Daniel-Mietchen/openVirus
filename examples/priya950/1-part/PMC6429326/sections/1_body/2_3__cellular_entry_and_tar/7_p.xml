<p>Preferential targets of ZIKV infection exhibited high expression levels of entry receptor genes, such as Axl and heat shock protein genes, which were enriched in not only radial glia cells, but also microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells [

The strong enrichment of Axl in radial glia of the human fetal cerebral cortex provides a possible explanation for why ZIKV selectively targets these neural stem cells and a potential mechanism for ZIKV-induced microcephaly. For example, Lemke et al. has identified two inhibitors of Axl, MYD1 and R248, that inhibit the ligand-receptor interaction and kinase activity of Axl, accordingly, to ultimately inhibit ZIKV infection [
