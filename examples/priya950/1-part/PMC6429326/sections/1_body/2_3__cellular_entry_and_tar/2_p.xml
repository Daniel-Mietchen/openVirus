<p>Upon entry of the host cell by endocytosis, ZIKV releases a viral genome that undergoes replication and virion assembly for further infection [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. ZIKV infection exhibits broad distribution and persistence in body tissues and fluids, a characteristic that distinguishes ZIKV from other arthropod-transmitted flaviviruses. For example, the presence of ZIKV has been detected in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women and in semen, suggesting the possibility of sexual and perinatal transmissions, both of which are routes that other arboviruses have not exhibited [

Despite the existence of various etiological agents of microcephaly, cell death of premature differentiation-induced depletion of neural stem cells (NSCs) is one possibility [

 <xref rid="B29-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was able to confirm that neural stem and progenitor cells were preferentially targeted by ZIKV. Furthermore, the capability of ZIKV to infect human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) has been confirmed in several studies. ZIKV exhibits preferential infection of neural progenitor cells, leading to cell-cycle arrest, increased apoptosis, and inhibition of NPC differentiation. All of these outcomes following ZIKV infection are associated with delayed development and birth defects, such as microcephaly in the mouse model [
