<p>ZIKV infection is also capable of breaching the bloodâ€“retinal barrier, as seen from the ocular symptoms. Although an immune privilege organ, an ocular ZIKV infection manifests as conjunctivitis and pan-uveitis, the former being the more common form of disease, in addition to induction of inflammation resulting from a pathogen-associated molecular pattern-activated response or the production of cytokines, cell death, and/or recruitment of leukocytes [

Despite the tropism displayed by ZIKV infection for specific regions of the eye, further studies are necessary to outline the exact mechanisms of ZIKV-induced ocular disease. Evidence of ZIKV infection persisting in organs such as the eyes and testis in both human and animal models demonstrates that organs previously considered immune privileged are sites of viral replication and persistence [
