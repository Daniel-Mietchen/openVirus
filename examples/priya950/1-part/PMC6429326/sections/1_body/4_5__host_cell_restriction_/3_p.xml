<p>Taking advantage of the fact the absence of type I IFN signaling leads to successful viral pathogenesis, viral replication can be inhibited by inducing ISGs as in the case of small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) [

In Savidis et al., gain- and loss-of function studies have revealed IFITM1 and IFITM3 as inhibitors of ZIKV, and IFITM3 specifically inhibited the early stages of ZIKV replication, evident from the significant decrease in the expression level of viral RNA. Accordingly, IFITM3 may be responsible for mounting an initial defense against ZIKV infection even before the induction of interferon signaling and downstream ISGs. As seen from the studies involving these proteins, IFITMs provide a possible mechanism for the prevention and treatment of viral infections including ZIKV [
