<p>Through active interference with viral replication in various ways, interferons (IFNs) orchestrate the primary response to viral infection [
 <xref rid="B75-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Their origin and cellular targets distinguish the three types of IFNs (I, II, III), all of which engage with their respective receptors to initiate signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway, and induce activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) [
 <xref rid="B76-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Upon activation, ISGs directly target factors of the virus life cycle to control the infection [
 <xref rid="B77-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. All three types of IFNs are implicated in mediating the antiviral state of the host immune response.
