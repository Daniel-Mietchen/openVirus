<p>Small non-coding RNAs are another potential restriction factor that can limit ZIKV replication. MicroRNA (miRNA) have been shown to have a role during ZIKV infection by regulating a broad spectrum of cellular processes [

In Smith et al., high content immunofluorescence screening identified miRNA34 to inhibit the replication of three flaviviruses (DENV, WNV, and JEV) through the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, during which a dampened Wnt signaling leads to TBK1-induced phosphorylation of IRF3 and initiation of downstream IFN signaling [
