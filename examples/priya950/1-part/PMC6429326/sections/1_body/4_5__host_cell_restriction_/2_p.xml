<p>Belonging to the same flavivirus genus, DENV and ZIKV share similarities beyond phylogeny, including host immune responses. Proteins of the type I IFN subgroup (including IFN- α, β, ε, τ, and δ) exhibited contradictory roles in DENV pathogenesis, during which certain proteins were upregulated compared to other that were reduced in infected patients [

 <xref rid="B83-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In vitro studies of type III IFNs induction following DENV infection demonstrated that IFN-λ has the inhibitory potential to control DENV replication [

 <xref rid="B37-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Syncytiotrophoblasts display constitutive expression of IFN- λ1, which acts in both autocrine and paracrine manner to protect other syncytiotrophoblasts and non-placental cells from ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. According to Chaudhary et al., ZIKV infection had differential effects on type I and type II IFN responses, as demonstrated by the ability of ZIKV NS5 to suppress type I and type III IFN while activating type II IFN signaling in a luciferase reporter assay [
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The differential regulation of type I and type II IFNs in turn result in selective expression of ISGs and differentiated activation of immune and proinflammatory responses [
