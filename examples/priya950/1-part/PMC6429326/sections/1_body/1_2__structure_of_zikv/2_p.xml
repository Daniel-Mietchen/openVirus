<p>Flaviviruses have the unique ability to produce subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) from the 3â€™ untranslated region (UTR) of the genomic RNA, and studies have shown that sfRNA not only is required for efficient virus replication, but also contributes to cytopathic effect (CPE) and pathogenicity [

 <xref rid="B23-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although it is unclear why flaviviruses, unlike other members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, evolved a mechanism to generate sfRNA, this noncoding RNA may be involved in regulating host antiviral response through RNA-mediated pathways. Pijlman et al. has shown that a reduction in CPE of viruses results from the failure to produce sfRNA1, a finding that suggests the role of sfRNA1 in inducing cell death following a virus infection [
