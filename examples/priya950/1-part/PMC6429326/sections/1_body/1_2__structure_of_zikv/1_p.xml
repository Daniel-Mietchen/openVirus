<p>ZIKV is a single stranded, positive sense RNA virus whose genome encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural proteins, such as capsid (C), membrane precursor (prM), envelope (E) proteins, and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5), as shown in

 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The structure of ZIKV is similar to that of other flaviviruses. Flaviviral NS1 is involved in viral replication and infection, and interacts with the host immune factors when secreted extracellularly for immune evasion and pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, NS1 has been suggested as a biomarker in diagnosis of flaviviruses such as DENV, which results in early stages of infection corresponding to high levels of NS1 secretion [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. NS3 consists of a protease domain, which is linked to NS2B to form a protease complex in the case of ZIKV, and a helicase domain [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As the largest and most conserved protein of the flavivirus genus, NS5 plays an important role in viral replication. ZIKV NS5 contains an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain, which is essential for viral replication, and a methyltransferase (MTase) domain, which is involved in translation and evasion of host immune response [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The envelope (E) protein, which mediates viral entry, of ZIKV possesses a highly conserved fusion loop region that is also found in WNV, YFV, and DENV1-4 [

 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As a result, the fusion loop serves as a target for antibodies generated against broad range of flaviviruses like DENV and ZIKV [

 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, transposon mutagenesis screening has demonstrated the capacity of ZIKV to tolerate genetic diversity, as evident from ZIKV E geneâ€™s tolerance of mutations, and this genetic flexibility within a viral genome has important implications on evasion mechanisms of adaptive immunity [
