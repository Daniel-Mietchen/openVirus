<p>Although animal models provide useful platforms for supplementing and elevating cell-based in vitro studies, these techniques fail to reflect the physiological parameters and cellular communication occurring in human conditions, which are essential to understand the mechanisms of development and disease. The lack of human-derived models has given rise to organoids and organ chips that rely on a combination of microfluidic and microfabrication techniques. Organoid technology and organ-specific chip models, such as placenta-on-a-chip and eye-on-a-chip, are able to mimic the interactive contributions made by major cell types involved in virus pathogenesis and overcoming the limitations of in vitro models [
