<p>The use of natural compounds has also been an alternative antiviral approach. For example, polyphenols, such as delphinidin and epigallocatechin gallate have exhibited potential antiviral activities against flaviviruses including ZIKV, DENV, and WNV [

A bacterially derived nanchangmycin is another natural compound that inhibited ZIKV entry in human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS), human brain microvascular endothelial cells, and human trophoblast cell line Jeg-3, and was also active against DENV, WNV, and chikungunya virus [
