<p>The reemergence of ZIKV has posed a serious threat to global public health and has prompted urgency for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutic treatments against ZIKV infection. Animal models have demonstrated the efficacy of various vaccine platforms, several of which have advanced to human trials [

 <xref rid="B107-ijms-20-01101" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Furthermore, modified mRNA encoding ZIKV prM-E and live-attenuated ZIKV with NS1 mutations studied in pregnant mice showed promising potential to protect against placental and fetal ZIKV infection, preventing congenital ZIKV syndrome [

Richner et al. demonstrated that vaccination with the two previously described platforms protected against challenge with ZIKV during pregnancy, as evident from the following: reduced level of viral mRNA in maternal, fetal, and placental tissue, and absence of virological evidence of transmission in majority of cases [
