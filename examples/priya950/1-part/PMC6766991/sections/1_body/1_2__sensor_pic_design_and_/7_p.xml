<p>To finish the fabrication process, and in order to allow the injection of light into the PICs and extract it from the rings to perform sensing, a fiber array (FA) was attached to the biosensor PIC. This attachment process was carried out in an alignment bench which allows the right alignment and attachment of the FA on the PIC grating couplers. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f003">Figure 3</xref> depicts the used fiber optics, which allows the PIC to connect to the laser and the photodiodes to perform the sensing. In our design, fiber array with a Multi-fiber Push On (MPO) connector was attached to the PIC. The use of such MPO connector makes easier the exchange of the PIC, since only one connector has to be removed. The FA will be connected to a fan-out element with 12 fibers, one corresponding to the laser signal, 8 for the ring optical outputs, and 3 back-up fibers.
