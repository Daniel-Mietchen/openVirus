 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows the plots of a PCV2 sensing experiment where rabbit polyclonal antibodies were immobilized on two of the ring resonators (red and black lines) whilst another not functionalized ring (green line) was used as a reference. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f007">Figure 7</xref>, the resonant notch shift of the three rings are plotted during the overall flowing process for four different concentrations of PCV2 viruses obtained from the same starting sample (1/100, 1/500, 1/1000 and 1/2000). The starting sample corresponds to a real sick animal with high/moderate amount of PCV2 virus concentration.
