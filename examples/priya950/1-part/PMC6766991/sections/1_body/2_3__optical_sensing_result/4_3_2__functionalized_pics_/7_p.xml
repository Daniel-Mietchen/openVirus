<p>Finally, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f008">Figure 8</xref> the photonic measurement responses (in terms of microring resonance notch shift) obtained during the experiment are shown against PCV2 virus for different dilution factors (from 1/100 to 1/5000 in PBS buffer). As it can be seen, positive detection was achieved up to 1/5000 dilution factors. It can be also observed that there is a clear dependence on the achieved results as a function of the virus concentration. So, for the more diluted sample, the less intensive optical signal is obtained.
