<p>Several photonic sensors PICs were functionalized with the aim of detecting PCV2 virus. To carry on this functionalization, the surface of the biosensor PIC was firstly oxidized. Then, the surface was rinsed with deionized water (DIW) and dried. After that, the silanization of the surface was carried out with a 3-chloropropyltriethoxysilane (CTES) solution. The activation of the group carboxylic from the CTES organosilane over the surface of the biosensor PIC was carried out by the addition of a mix of carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). The incubation was done at room temperature for 30 min and then the surface was rinsed and dried with air flow. On top of the surface, commercial rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PCV2 virus (
