<p>As it can be observed in the plots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-03985-f007">Figure 7</xref>, the two ring resonators which were functionalized with polyclonal antibodies, responded positively against the virus, as a remarkable shift in the resonance notch of the microring is observed. In contrast, the microring resonator which was not functionalized (reference ring) just showed minor changes in its resonance position due to the unspecific binding which occurs in this case.
