<p>On the other hand, the development of new micro and nano instruments and technologies, and their heterogeneous integration into smart systems, has become one of the key enablers in achieving the next generation of advanced photonic biosensors, which will be used in real and high impact scenarios. To achieve this goal, the next generation of photonic biosensors must be based on systemic miniaturization and integration of heterogeneous technologies, functions, and materials, and must ensure the convergence of nano, bio, and information and communications technologies (ICT) to achieve smaller, smarter, and energy autonomous devices and systems. In addition, this heterogeneous integration (photonic/bio and new materials) is also a key factor in reaching miniaturized and multisensing photonic integrated circuits (PIC) and systems able to sense, understand context, and communicate. Having these fast, efficient, and reliable multisensing devices and systems is essential in many fields such as medical diagnostics, food safety control, or environmental control. In addition using nanostructures allows for high interaction with the matter and faster responses.</p>
