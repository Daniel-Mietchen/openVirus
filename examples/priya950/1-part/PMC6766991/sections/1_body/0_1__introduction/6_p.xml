<p>As mentioned, the SWINOSTICS diagnostic bio sensors and tools will be used in a strategic field such as livestock products, which have dramatically increased in demand during the last 40 years due to the increasing human population, urbanization rates, and income growth rate. Concretely, SWINOSTICS targets six emerging and endemic swine viruses: African swine fever (ASF) [

 <xref rid="B19-sensors-19-03985" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PPRS) [
 <xref rid="B20-sensors-19-03985" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], porcine parvovirus (PPV) [
 <xref rid="B21-sensors-19-03985" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) [
 <xref rid="B22-sensors-19-03985" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and Swine Influenza A (SIV) [
 <xref rid="B23-sensors-19-03985" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Traditionally, these virus detections in the laboratory rely on two different approaches: direct detection of the pathogen by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or cell culture-based virus isolation, and/or detection of circulatory antibodies in blood samples. All of these are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not properly suitable for a portable field device as proposed in the SWINOSTICS project. The use of the proposed biosensors will allow an important reduction in the detection time and cost in such a high impact field as livestock.
