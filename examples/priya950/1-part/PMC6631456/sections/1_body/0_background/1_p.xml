<p id="Par12">Acute infectious conjunctivitis is a very common disease that is usually caused by viruses or bacteria; it has high incidence rates. Outbreaks of acute infectious conjunctivitis can occur in schools, military camps and hospitals where people gather, and it can impose economic and social burdens [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; adenoviruses are one of the main causes of viral conjunctivitis. Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] with icosahedral capsids in the family Adenoviridae. The viral particles, which are approximately 65 to 80 nm in size, consist of protein capsids, core proteins and DNA. The HAdV capsid consists of seven structural proteins, three major capsid proteins, hexon, fibre, penton, and four minor ‘cement’ proteins, namely, protein IIIa (pIIIa), VI, VIII and IX (pIX). Among them, hexon, as a major capsid component, is a target for host immune responses against HAdV, Fibre and penton are important for viral cell entry, as they bind to cellular receptor(s) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and 88 types. More than 10 types of HAdVs are associated with common ocular infections, and HAdV 1–5, 7, 8, 11, 14, 19, 22, 37, 42, 48, 53, 54, 56, and 64 are associated with acute conjunctivitis. Of these, HAdV-8, − 19 and − 37 cause a severe form of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) [
