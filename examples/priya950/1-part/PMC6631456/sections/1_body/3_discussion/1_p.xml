<p id="Par31">In May 2018, two outbreaks in two boarding primary schools occurred successively, with an interval of 5 days. The epidemics lasted for approximately 2 months and one and a half months, respectively. The disease was spread widely among students in the two schools with a high incidence (30.59, 20.4%). In one of the schools, the incidence in male students was significantly higher than that in female students. The patients had typical EKC manifestations and a long course of the disease. The main risk factor for infection was close contact with the patient or articles contaminated by the patient. In the outbreak investigation, we identified an index case in Weixi Ethnic School who was infected with a propagated type and had an incubation period (IP) approximately 6â€‰days; these characteristics fit HAdV conjunctivitis very well. The pathogen causing the outbreaks was determined to be HAdV-8. The virus was highly similar to the 2016 HAdV-8 strain in Tibet, China.</p>
