<p id="Par30">The whole genome sequence of all 26 HAdV-positive specimens was obtained by next-generation sequencing. The results of the sequence alignment indicated that the similarity of these whole genome sequences was 100%, and the viruses belonged to the same virus strain. BLAST results showed that this virus was HAdV-8. The phylogenetic tree analysis showed that 26 Yunnan HAdVs belonged to the HAdV-8 branch (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which was highly similar to other HAdV-8 specimens. The hexon phylogenetic tree showed that Yunnan HAdV-8 had high similarity with other HAdV 8 specimens. Notably, the genetic distance between Yunnan HAdV-8 and HAdV-8E was close and they were classified as a cluster (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide similarity of the hexon gene between Yunnan HAdV-8 and other HAdV-8 specimens was 99.68–99.96%, with a 0–9 nucleotide differences. The amino acid similarity was 99.45–100%, with 0–3 amino acid differences. The nucleotide sequence difference in the hexon gene between Yunnan HAdV-8 and Tibetan HAdV-8 was only one base, and the nucleotide similarities of the fibre and penton genes were 100%. Moreover, the amino acid mutation caused by amino acid differences was synonymous. Yunnan HAdV-8 had the highest similarity with Tibetan HAdV-8.
