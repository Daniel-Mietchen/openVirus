  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the HAdV-8 strains from the outbreaks in Yunnan compared to the HAdV-8 strains from other countries and 40 HAdV species D viruses based on 
   <bold>a</bold> the entire hexon gene; 
   <bold>b</bold> the entire fibre gene; and 
   <bold>c</bold> the entire penton gene. The HAdV-8 strains isolated in Yunnan are highlighted in red fonts and red triangles, and the HAdV-8 strains from Tibet are indicated by blue squares
