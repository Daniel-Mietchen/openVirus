The aims of this study were to determine the intensity and characteristics of the outbreaks, as well as the clinical manifestations in the patients, the risk factors for infection and the pathogen responsible for the two outbreaks.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">An outbreak investigation was conducted in two primary schools, and a case-control study including patients from the Weixi County Ethnic Primary School was performed. Relevant specimens were collected according to the case definition, and next-generation sequencing was employed to identify the pathogen. An epidemiological investigation method was used to analyse the related epidemiological characteristics, such as risk factors. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA 7.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 331 acute conjunctivitis cases, including probable cases of EKC, were reported in the two schools, and the attack rates were 30.59% (171/559, 95%<italic>CI</italic>: 26.76&#x02013;34.42) and 20.41% (160/784, 95%<italic>CI</italic>: 17.58&#x02013;23.24), respectively. Cases occurred in all grades and classes in both schools, and only one staff member in each school presented illness. The epidemics lasted for 54&#x02009;days and 45&#x02009;days, respectively. The patients had typical manifestations of EKC, such as acute onset, follicular hyperplasia, pseudomembrane formation, preauricular lymphadenopathy, corneal involvement and blurred vision, and a relatively long disease course (average 9.40&#x02009;days, longest 23&#x02009;days and shortest 7&#x02009;days). The risk factor for infection was close contact with a patient or personal items contaminated by a patient. The pathogen responsible for the outbreaks was HAdV-8. The virus was highly similar to the 2016 HAdV-8 strain from Tibet, China.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This study strongly suggests that HAdV-8 could lead to serious consequences. This is the second report of a HAdV-8-associated EKC outbreak in mainland China. Tibetan HAdV-8 might be circulating in southwest China; therefore, it is necessary to monitor the pathogens causing acute conjunctivitis in this area.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Human adenovirus 8</kwd><kwd>Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis</kwd><kwd>Risk factors</kwd><kwd>Phylogenetic</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Research Subject of National Science and Technology Major Project </institution></funding-source><award-id>2017ZX10104001</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Application of Virus-based Whole Genome Sequence Traceability Technology in the system of Yunnan Province Disease Control and Prevention</institution></funding-source><award-id>2017ZX10104001-005-002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">Acute infectious conjunctivitis is a very common disease that is usually caused by viruses or bacteria; it has high incidence rates. Outbreaks of acute infectious conjunctivitis can occur in schools, military camps and hospitals where people gather, and it can impose economic and social burdens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In recent years, viral conjunctivitis has been the most common form, followed by bacterial conjunctivitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; adenoviruses are one of the main causes of viral conjunctivitis. Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] with icosahedral capsids in the family Adenoviridae. The viral particles, which are approximately 65 to 80&#x02009;nm in size, consist of protein capsids, core proteins and DNA. The HAdV capsid consists of seven structural proteins, three major capsid proteins, hexon, fibre, penton, and four minor &#x02018;cement&#x02019; proteins, namely, protein IIIa (pIIIa), VI, VIII and IX (pIX). Among them, hexon, as a major capsid component, is a target for host immune responses against HAdV, Fibre and penton are important for viral cell entry, as they bind to cellular receptor(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Based on their serological, biochemical and genetic properties, HAdVs have been classified into seven species (A-G) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and 88 types. More than 10 types of HAdVs are associated with common ocular infections, and HAdV 1&#x02013;5, 7, 8, 11, 14, 19, 22, 37, 42, 48, 53, 54, 56, and 64 are associated with acute conjunctivitis. Of these, HAdV-8, &#x02212;&#x02009;19 and&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;37 cause a severe form of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

The epidemics lasted for approximately 2 months and one and a half months, respectively. The disease was spread widely among students in the two schools with a high incidence (30.59, 20.4%). In one of the schools, the incidence in male students was significantly higher than that in female students. The patients had typical EKC manifestations and a long course of the disease. The main risk factor for infection was close contact with the patient or articles contaminated by the patient. In the outbreak investigation, we identified an index case in Weixi Ethnic School who was infected with a propagated type and had an incubation period (IP) approximately 6&#x02009;days; these characteristics fit HAdV conjunctivitis very well. The pathogen causing the outbreaks was determined to be HAdV-8. The virus was highly similar to the 2016 HAdV-8 strain in Tibet, China.</p><p id="Par32">Since the 1980s, EKC outbreaks caused by HAdV-8 have been reported in different countries and regions of the world. Most of the outbreaks were caused by iatrogenic ophthalmic transmission in hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Two outbreaks of EKC in two schools in the Tibet autonomous region were reported for the first time in mainland China. However, the focus of this study was on virology; therefore, it lacks detailed epidemiological data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">This outbreak caused by HAdV-8 is the first reported in the region and the second EKC outbreak reported in mainland China. Previous studies have shown that the duration of EKC outbreaks caused by iatrogenic transmission is between 5 and 10&#x02009;months, while the duration of EKC outbreaks in schools is between 1 and 1.5&#x02009;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Aside from the late detection of the outbreak and the lack of timely control measures, the main reasons for the long duration of the outbreak were that the adenovirus can survive for several weeks in the environment, remain infectious on surfaces for up to a month, and resist common disinfectants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, the patient was infectious within 14&#x02009;days of the onset of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Epidemiological studies of several EKC outbreaks in large ophthalmic clinics and hospitals have shown that strict hand-washing, instrument disinfection and proper medical waste disposal are not sufficient to prevent hospital transmission during an outbreak. The epidemic can only be brought under control when patients are strictly quarantined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">The duration of iatrogenic EKC outbreaks in hospitals is longer than that in schools. The reason may be that iatrogenic outbreaks are not easy to detect and a large number of people are exposed in batches. School outbreaks are easy to detect, and epidemic control measures can be implemented quickly. School attendance suspension may also prevent the outbreak from continuing. Most EKC outbreaks show two or more peaks, with different intervals of time between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It may be that a large number of people are exposed in groups at different times. After a long period, exposed groups will develop the disease at different times, but the exact reasons for this are unclear. According to previous studies, iatrogenic EKC outbreaks can occur throughout the year, and school EKC outbreaks occur most often between May and October. It is difficult to analyse because relatively fewer school outbreaks have occurred or been reported. Previous studies have shown that acute conjunctivitis is most common in summer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">The clinical manifestations, frequency of symptoms and signs of EKC and course of the disease were different from those in other studies because of variations in the virulence, sample sizes, observation time points and influence of the observer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The patients in our study had some common manifestations of viral conjunctivitis, as well as the common characteristics of EKC, including follicular hyperplasia, pseudomembrane formation, preauricular lymphadenopathy, corneal involvement and blurred vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Conjunctival hyperaemia and increased secretion are common features of acute conjunctivitis, while watery secretions are more characteristic of viral conjunctivitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">These characteristics are of great significance for laboratory detection and field epidemiology investigations. The duration of the disease observed in this outbreak was basically consistent with that of a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Regarding the risk factors for transmission, previous studies have focused on risk factors for transmission in hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our research reveals the risk factors for school transmission in remote areas in developing countries. Some risk factors, such as occurrence in the family, contact with a patient&#x02019;s eye or hands, and sharing eye drops with a patient, are similar to those reported in previous studies. In this investigation, it was found that sharing soap, bedding, and pillows with patients were also risk factors for infection. Teachers generally have no close contact with students, so the disease is not widely spread among staff.</p><p id="Par38">With the popularization and application of real-time fluorescent PCR and next-generation sequencing technologies, the detection and whole genome sequences of pathogens can be obtained in a short period of time, with practical significance for the determination and cessation of the epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The Yunnan virus genome was highly similar to the Tibet virus gene, suggesting that the same virus strain was circulating in the region because Yunnan Diqing Prefecture is adjacent to Tibet, and the people of both localities are in close contact with each other.</p><p id="Par39">Prior to the outbreak of EKC, clinical cases of AHC had been reported in the local community. The investigation of the index cases in the two schools found that the two cases came to the clinic after the onset of the disease and returned to school 3 to 4&#x02009;days after the illness. These two cases may be the source of infection of the outbreak. The incubation period of the disease could not be obtained in this outbreak due to the lack of exposure time. The event was initially identified as an AHC outbreak, which was handled according to the guidelines in the diagnostic criteria and management principles for EKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and the patients were isolated for 7 to 10&#x02009;days. Obviously, the isolation period of 7 to 10&#x02009;days for EKC patients was not enough, as some patients still shed the virus. Sometimes, it is difficult to implement strict public health measures in schools. Insufficient periods of isolation for patients and relaxed control measures may be important factors in the persistence and spread of an outbreak. In China, AHC is the only notifiable acute conjunctivitis disease. Due to the lack of an aetiological diagnosis, clinically suspected cases of viral conjunctivitis are more likely to be reported as clinically diagnosed AHC cases in many areas. There was no adenovirus isolated in our study, which may be related to specimens containing decreased virus loads.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">Close contact with patients or articles contaminated by patients was a risk factor for infection and further transmission of EKC. The strict isolation of patients was crucial to the control of the outbreak.
