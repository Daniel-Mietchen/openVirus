<p>Weekly statistics of the specimens’ number positive for influenza across six analyzed countries were collected from the World Health Organization (WHO) website through a FluNet global web-based tool [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00207" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The virological data entered into FluNet were collected from National Influenza Centers (NICs) of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and other national influenza reference laboratories collaborating actively with GISRS, or were uploaded from the WHO regional databases. Daily statistics of five meteorological factors (temperature (°C), humidity (%), wind speed (mph), pressure (Hg), precipitation (cm)) were manually exported from the web-interface of the Weather Underground service for six capitals. The Weather Underground accumulates information from the National Weather Service (NWS), and over 250,000 personal weather stations (PWS). Time series (cloud-free erythemal) of UV index data were obtained from the operational Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service (TEMIS) ozone data archive.
