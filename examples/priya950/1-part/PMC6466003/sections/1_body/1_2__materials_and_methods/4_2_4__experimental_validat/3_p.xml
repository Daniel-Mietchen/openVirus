<p>Human primary macrophages were derived from leukocyte-rich buffy coats from healthy blood donors. In particular, monocytes were isolated as described previously [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00207" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Monocytes were seeded in 96- or 6-well plates and cultured in serum free macrophage media (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 10 ng/mL granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin mixture at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 7 days, polarizing the monocytes into macrophages of the acute pro-inflammatory M1-phenotype. Before stimulation, the media was replaced with fresh GM-CSF free macrophage media.
