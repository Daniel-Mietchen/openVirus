<p>The A/Helsinki/P18/2009(pdm09) virus was isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirates of Finnish patients in 2009 [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00207" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The viral genome was sequenced (GeneBank accession numbers: JQ173161â€“JQ173168). The virus was exposed to different temperatures, UVB or UVC radiation. Resulting viruses were titered on MDCK cells using plaque assay as described previously [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00207" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The virus titers were determined by calculating the plaque forming units (PFU) for each sample and expressed as PFU/mL.
