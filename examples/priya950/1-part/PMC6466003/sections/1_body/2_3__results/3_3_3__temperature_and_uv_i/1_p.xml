<p>To confirm our finding, we analyzed associations between six meteorological factors and IV activity in six European countries during 2010–2017. Both low temperature and low UV index remained the most predictive meteorological factors of IV activity peaks (

Interestingly, the peaks of IV activity occurred on average at −1.9 °C (range −19.9 °C to 26.0 °C) and with a UV index of 0.7 (range 0.13 to 7.1). However, colder winters contributed to an increase of IV activity only in Finland and Lithuania (
