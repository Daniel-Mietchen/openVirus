<p>Our experiments with UVB-, UVC- or temperature-exposed viruses showed that low temperature and UVB preserved infectivity of IV in vitro. It should be noted, that exposure to UVC radiation inactivated the virus. However, UVC, by contrast to UVB, is absorbed by atmosphere and, therefore, could not reach the earth surface and affect IV-host interaction.</p>
