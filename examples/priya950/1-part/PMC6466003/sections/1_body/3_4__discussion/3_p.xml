<p>Previous association studies showed that warmer winters could contribute to the decrease in IV activity in Europe and the US [

In particular, mild epidemics were associated with warm winters, which were followed by cold winters with severe IV outbreaks with early onset. It was proposed that fewer people were infected with influenza during warm winters, thereby leaving an unnaturally large fraction of susceptible individuals in the population going into the next season leading to early and severe epidemics. Our study does not support an association between warmer winters and a decrease in IV activity, because such a trend was observed only for two of six analyzed countries for the period from 2010 to 2018. Hence, there must be other factors such as host age and immune competence that influence IV activity, which are outside of the scope of this study.
