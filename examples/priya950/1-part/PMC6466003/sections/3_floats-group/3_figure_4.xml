  <p>Effect of temperature and UV radiation on infectivity of GFP-encoding influenza A virus (PR8-GFP). (
   <bold>A</bold>) PR8-GFP was incubated at indicated temperatures for 48 h or exposed to UVB or UVC radiation for the indicated times. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized retinal pigment (RPE) cells were subsequently infected with the virus. GFP expression was visualized using fluorescent microscopy. The size of each image corresponds to 1000 × 1250 μM
   <sup>2</sup>. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Viruses were obtained and RPE cells were infected as for (A). Viability of cells were measured using Cell Titer Glow assay. Mean ± SD, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Viruses were obtained and RPE cells were infected as for panel A. Death of cells were measured using Cell Tox Green assay. Mean ± SD, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3.
