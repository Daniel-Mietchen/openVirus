  <p>Association between meteorological factors (temperature, UV index, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and pressure) and influenza activity in six Northern Europe countries averaged for the period from week 35 of 2010 and week 34 of 2017. (
   <bold>Left</bold>) Correlation analysis between meteorological factors and influenza activity. (
   <bold>Right</bold>) Contribution of each meteorological factor to predictive performance of machine-learning Random Forest models trained to predict the influenza virus (IV) activity in six Northern European countries. Contribution is measured as percentage mean decrease in accuracy (the higher the bar, the more important the feature is). Both metrics are averaged for the period from 2010 to 2017 epidemic seasons. Each error bar shows a 95% confidence interval for the mean of six countries (
