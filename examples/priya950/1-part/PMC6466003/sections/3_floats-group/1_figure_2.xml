  <p>Association between six meteorological factors (temperature, UV index, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and pressure) and influenza activity in six Northern Europe countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) between week 35 of 2017 and week 34 of 2018. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Contribution of each meteorological factor to predictive performance of a machine learning Random Forest model trained to predict influenza activity. The contribution is measured as percentage mean decrease in accuracy (the higher the bar, the more important the factor). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Correlation between meteorological factors and influenza activity. Absolute values of Pearson correlation coefficient (95% confidence interval) are shown.
