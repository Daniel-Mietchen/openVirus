<p>Surveillance is the collection of information to help decision-makers take the appropriate actions to control RVFV. RVF surveillance activities include forecasting, early warning, and risk indicators, raising awareness, a reporting system, outbreak investigations, environmental surveillance, vector surveillance, and sentinel herds. The presence of several RVF outbreaks in Egypt was attributed to the lack of regular surveillance. Additionally, control of RVFV in Egypt is also limited due to difficult vector control, the absence of licensed human vaccine in Egypt, and availability of either inactivated vaccines with limited efficacy or live attenuated vaccines with reversion to virulence, and abortion storms in pregnant animals [

The best ways to prevent the entrance of RVF to Egypt or maintenance of RVF infection are; the developing and enhancing the regional monitoring system, establishing early warning and detection system, and using the One Health approach, which might help in the disease prediction and detection in animals before it is transmitted to humans. Egyptian veterinary authorities tried to apply these measures to prevent the introduction and spread of RVFV; however, some deficiencies still exist [

Major RVFV outbreaks in animals precede human epidemics so the surveillance system of the disease should be started by One Health decision makers six months before the occurrence of the first human case [

There are some indicators of an RVF outbreak such as: (1) climatic change, (2) heavy prolonged rainfalls, (3) presence of widespread flooding, (4) increase mosquitosâ€™ populations, (5) outbreaks of human febrile disease, and (6) hospital confirmed human case [
