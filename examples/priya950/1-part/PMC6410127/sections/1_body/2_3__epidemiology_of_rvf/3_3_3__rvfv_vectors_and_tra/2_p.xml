<p>Notably, each of RVF epidemics in Egypt was caused by a different mosquito species. For example, during the epidemic of 1977, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. antennatus</italic> were involved in the transmission of RVFV in El-Sharquiya province [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; while during the 1993 epidemic, 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic> acted as the primary RVFV vector; however, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. antennatus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx. perexiguus</italic> were also involved in this epidemic [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. 
 <italic>Ae. caspius</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. perexiguus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. antennatus</italic> were estimated to transmit 20%, 11%, 7%, and 7% of the RVF infection, respectively [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Most of the mosquitoes that transmitted RVFV during the 1993 epidemic were zoophagic rather than anthropophagic that fed on large animals (bovines, ovines, and equines) rather than humans [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Additionally, during the 2003 epidemic, six species of mosquitoes were involved in the virus transmission in Kafr El-Sheikh province (
 <italic>Cx. antennatus</italic> was the predominant species; 95.8%). However, the entomologic investigations characterized three RVFV isolates out of 297 tested female mosquitoâ€™s pools, and all three cases came from 
 <italic>Cx. antennatus</italic>. It was considered the first report for natural infection of 
 <italic>Cx. antennatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].
