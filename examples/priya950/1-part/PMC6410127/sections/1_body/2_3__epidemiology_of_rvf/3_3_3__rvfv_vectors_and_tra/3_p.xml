<p>There are two existing cycles of RVFV perpetuation in nature: (1) an enzootic cycle that occurs in the enzootic area of Africa during normal rainfall and (2) epidemic-epizootic cycle. During the first cycle, RVFV is present in a silent infection cycle emerges after rainfall to start the disease epizootics again. During this cycle, the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes transmit the virus vertically to their offspring. During the epidemic-epizootic cycle, the mosquitoes transmitted the virus transovarially. This cycle occurs during abnormal heavy rainfall and flooding of dams. The 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes distribute the virus and induce the emergence of outbreaks. [
