<p>RVF virus has been isolated from several vectors including mosquitoes, ticks, and other flies [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. There are about 19 culicine mosquito species that are distributed in different Egyptian provinces and are considered the main vector and source for RVFV transmission [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Mosquito genera such as 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mansonia</italic> can transmit the virus [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The vectors of RVF virus are classified into maintenance vectors (
 <italic>Aedes</italic>) and amplifying vectors (
 <italic>Culex</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species present in temporary flooded ground pools can acquire the infection through feeding on infected animalâ€™s blood. The virus can survive on eggs of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes during inter-epizootic periods [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The eggs then require a period of dehydration, and they hatch into young virus-infected mosquitoes after heavy rainfall [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes are involved in the transmission cycle once the virus is transmitted and replicated in host animals [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Both 
 <italic>Cx pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx antennatus</italic> are considered as natural vectors of RVF virus.
