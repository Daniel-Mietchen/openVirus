<p>Egypt has been frequently affected by RVF outbreaks which are mainly associated with the importation of animals from endemic sub-Saharan countries. Therefore, vaccination of the animals before importation or upon their arrival would help in the control of RVF epidemics. Between 2012 and 2015, approximately 762,291 camels were legally imported to Egypt: 79.4% from Sudan and 20.6% from Ethiopia. However, approximately 149,943 cattle were legally imported to Egypt: 67% from Sudan and 33% from Ethiopia [

Interestingly, cattle were slaughtered in quarantine facilities (no imported cattle were allowed to be released alive from the quarantine), while the camels were released from the quarantine to slaughterhouses or to animal markets. There was a low risk of RVFV transmission by vectors in many quarantine facilities including (1) Abu Simbel quarantine, where camels and cattle were imported from Sudan, (2) Sahl Hasheesh quarantine, where cattle were imported from Ethiopia, (3) Shelateen quarantine, where camels were imported from Eastern Sudan, and (4) Adabiya quarantine, where camels imported from Ethiopia. However, there was a high risk of RVFV transmission by vectors in Al Qata quarantine, where camels from Ethiopia arrived [
