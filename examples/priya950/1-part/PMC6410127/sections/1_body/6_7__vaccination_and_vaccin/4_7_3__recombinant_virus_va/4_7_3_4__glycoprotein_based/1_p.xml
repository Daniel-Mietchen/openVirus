<p>Subunit vaccines have the advantages of using viral protein or parts of viral protein which enhance the protective immune response. The subunit vaccine contains Gn/Gc and possesses a neutralizing antibody response to protect sheep and lambs against RVFV infection [

 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The vaccination with pure and crude RVFV surface glycoprotein induced strong neutralizing antibodies that completely protect against a challenge test. The subunit vaccine is highly safe for use in endemic areas and DIVA vaccine, but is poorly immunogenic and requires the use of booster doses [
