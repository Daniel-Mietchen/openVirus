<p>Outbreaks of RVF indicated that human RVF infections were caused by contact with infected livestock, which is considered as an intermediate host between the vector and the humans [

Therefore, routine vaccination is considered as the cornerstone in controlling RVFV infections in animals in endemic countries to prevent human infections, socioeconomic loss, and disease outbreaks. The humoral immunity is sufficient for the protection against RVF infections [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], and the importance of cell-mediated immunity is still unknown. For example, the newborn lambs can acquire protection against RVF through the colostrums of immunized ewes [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. There are no licensed vaccines for humans in Egypt, while there are three licensed veterinary vaccines used to protect ruminants against RVFV infections, including one live attenuated virus vaccine, and two inactivated virus vaccine. The ideal RVF vaccines must be efficient, safe, stable, elicit a rapid humoral immune response, induce long-term protection, and have low cost. Most of the RVFV vaccines are experimental and have only been tested in laboratory animals.
