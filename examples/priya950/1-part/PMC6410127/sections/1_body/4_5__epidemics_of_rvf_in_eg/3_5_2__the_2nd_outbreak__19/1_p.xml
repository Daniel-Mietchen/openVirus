 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. During this outbreak, the infection spread from the South to the North of Egypt in most of the Nile Delta and El-Faiyum provinces [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. RVF was reported by the Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) in animal farms located in Damietta province that used the live attenuated RVFV vaccine 20 days before the occurrence of the outbreak. Interestingly, the isolated viruses from the 1977 and the 1993 epidemics were phylogenetically similar [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00139" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This means that the virus was either reintroduced in 1993 from the same source (Sudan) or remained endemic between the two outbreaks. The RVF symptoms were detected by the Egyptian General Organization for Veterinary Services (GOVs) in imported pregnant cows and calves from South Africa after vaccination with the RVF live attenuated Smithburn vaccine.
