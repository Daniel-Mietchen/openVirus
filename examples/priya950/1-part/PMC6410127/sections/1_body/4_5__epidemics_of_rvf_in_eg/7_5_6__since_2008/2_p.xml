<p>Furthermore, antibodies against RVFV during the inter-epidemic period (2014 to 2015) were detected using different diagnostic methods such as ELISA, virus neutralization test (VNT), and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). The investigated animals (sheep, goats, buffaloes, and camels) were non-vaccinated, born after the last recorded Egyptian RVF epidemic in 2003, and were not imported from RVF endemic countries. The seroprevalence was 0%, 0.5%, 3.2%, and 5.9% in goats, sheep, camels, and buffaloes with total seroprevalence of 2.3% in all tested animals. This indicated the presence of a new RVF epidemic [
