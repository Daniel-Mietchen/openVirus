The researchers found that the highest antibody level against RVF was detected in vaccinated cattle, buffaloes, sheep, and goats using serum neutralization test (SNT), agar gel precipitation test (AGPT), and enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) from El-Menofia and Marsa Matrouh province with prevalence ranged between 68–80% and 80–93%, respectively. However, the lowest levels of antibodies (8.9–17.8%) were reported in vaccinated sheep from El-Qalubia province. The researchers also reported the prevalence of RVFV among non-vaccinated cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, and camels. They found that the coverage rates against RVFV were 2.8–4.8%, 10–15%, 14–19%, and 24–30% in El-Qalubia, Kafr El-Sheikh, El-Dakahlia, and El-Sharquia provinces, respectively [
