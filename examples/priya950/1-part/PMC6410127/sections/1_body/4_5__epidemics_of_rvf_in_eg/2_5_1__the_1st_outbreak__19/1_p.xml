<p>The largest epizootic outbreak in Egypt resulted in severe losses (200,000 human infections and 600 deaths). During this epidemic, the virus was not only isolated from humans, but also from domestic animals, and rats (
 <italic>Rattus rattus frugivorous</italic>). During this outbreak, the first reported case was in Belbies, a city in El-Sharquia province in a man who suffered from an acute febrile dengue-like illness [

Massive human losses during Egyptian first RVF outbreak were due to: (1) a lack of the public background about the RVFV infection in Egypt, including clinical signs, vector, risk factors, and mode of transmission, (2) insufficient health education programs in Egypt about the RVFV and the required actions during outbreaks, (3) the absence of One Health program to control the disease, and (4) the high susceptibility of children and immunocompromised patients to RVFV infection. The disease reappeared again in the Aswan province of Egypt in 1983, and the reported seroprevalence in buffaloes, sheep, cattle, camels, goats, and equines were 35.3%, 22%, 14%, 7.3%, 6%, and 5.3%, respectively [
