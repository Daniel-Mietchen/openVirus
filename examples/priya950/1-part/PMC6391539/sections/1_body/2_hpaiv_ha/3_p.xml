<p>The dominant circulating AIV strains that have arisen since 2015 comprise viruses in the clade 2.3.4.4, which includes reassortant viruses in the H5N6, H5N8, and H5N2 subtypes. However, the strains within this clade that have crossed over into the human population are limited to the H5N6 subtype. The ability of H5N6 viruses to spill over into the human population may be associated with mutations in the HA molecule that affect the specific RBS binding preference of HA. These H5N6 viruses preferentially bind to different sialic acids depending on the host from which each virus was isolated.
