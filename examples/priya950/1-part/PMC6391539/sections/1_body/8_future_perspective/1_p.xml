<p>In order to combat the evolution and divergence of H5Nx avian influenza, a universal avian influenza vaccine (UAIV) for the human population should be developed. A UAIV would be broadly protective against multiple viruses that span throughout several clades and against multiple mismatched NA (H5N1, H5N2, H5N6, H5N8). This vaccine should provide protective antibody- or cell-mediated response against viral challenge with one vaccine dose. Multiple or boost vaccination has been attempted with heterologous prime-boost strategy in AIV vaccination studies.

 </sup> Although these types of vaccine protocols have proven successful, in the event of an epidemic, single-dose adjuvanted vaccination would be less time consuming and more cost effective. In the event that a single dose is sufficient, a greater portion of the population would have access to the vaccine compared with a two-dose strategy where perhaps only half the population would receive the dose.

 </sup> Protective efficacy would also span multiple age groups, taking into account pre-immunity to seasonal influenza strains such as H1N1 and H3N2. Although these qualifications for a UAIV may seem too far fetched, there has been progress in recent years. Our group has reported on a computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen adjuvanted vaccine that provides protection against heterologous challenges in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primate models,
