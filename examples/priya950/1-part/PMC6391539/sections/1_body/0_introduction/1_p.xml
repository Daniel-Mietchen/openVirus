<p>Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) naturally circulate in wild aquatic birds, such as ducks, geese, swans, gulls, shorebirds, and terns.

 </sup> AIVs of the subtype H5N1 are often highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs), which was originally discovered in geese in China’s Guangdong province in 1996. Several outbreaks occurred in farmed geese in Sanshui, a small town 50 miles outside the capital of Guangdong with a mortality rate of more than 40%.

 </sup> By 1997, the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996-like viruses spilled over into the live poultry markets in Hong Kong with high rates of mortality. Simultaneously, there were 18 confirmed human cases of HPAIV infection, 6 of whom died.

 </sup> There was a large degree of homology between the avian isolates and the viral isolates collected from these human infections indicating that these viruses were being transmitted from birds to human hosts.
