<p>The next influenza pandemic is inevitable and most likely will emerge from a novel subtype to which the human population has no pre-existing immunity. The ability of an HPAIV to accumulate the appropriate mutations or reassortment with an efficient human or swine virus resulting in a human transmissible virus is possible and could initiate a new pandemic. Therefore, continued scientific studies and surveillance of AIVs are essential to develop vaccines and therapeutics, not only for the poultry industry, but also to prepare for the next AIV emergence into the human population.</p>
