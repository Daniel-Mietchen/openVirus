<p>The molecular basis of HPAI H5Nx viruses to induce pathogenicity, as well as the potential for these viruses to adapt to humans was reviewed. The segmented genome of the influenza virus facilitates reassortment in hosts that are infected with more than one strain of influenza virus. These reassortment events in birds and swine have generated new and novel strains of AIVs, including the divergent 2.3.4.4 clade viruses that contain avian NA proteins. Influenza viruses with genomic RNA segments coding for internal and nonstructural proteins such as PB1, PB2, PA, and NS1 have increased viral replication and overall enhanced pathogenicity. Reassortment of AIV RNA segments with seasonal human influenza virus strains in swine by co-infection may not factor into the evolution of novel avian viruses. Swine that are infected with AIVs have no clinical signs of infection and do not transmit nascent virions to immunologically na√Øve hosts. However, these animals may have a subclinical infection that could in fact promote reassortment events upon co-infection.</p>
