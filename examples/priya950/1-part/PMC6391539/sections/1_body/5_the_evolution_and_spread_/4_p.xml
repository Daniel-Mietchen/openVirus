<p>The A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996-like viruses are still being detected in poultry and wild birds in many countries. The majority of these isolates are classified as clade 2, including the subclades 2.2.1.2 in Egypt and 2.3.2.1a in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and India.

 </sup> H5 viruses designated in the clade 2.3.2.1c have been detected in wild-bird populations in China, Southeast Asia, and Africa.

 </sup> H5 influenza viruses of the clade 2.3.4.4 have been detected in wild birds around the world. The clade 2.3.4.4 viruses from Africa and Europe are primarily of the H5N8 subtype, whereas those viruses isolated in Asia are of the H5N6 subtype, and those strains isolated in the USA are classified as H5N2 isolates.

 </sup> Clade 2.3.4.4 H5 influenza viruses have caused 1537 outbreaks in birds in 14 countries over the past decade.

 </sup> These outbreaks have been associated with H5N6, H5N8, H5N2, and H5N3. These viruses emerged through multiple reassortment events with the H5N1 subtype and now routinely circulate in domestic poultry and waterfowl.

 </sup> The first 2.3.4.4 virus that emerged was classified as a H5N6 subtype and it circulated throughout China and traveled to Southeast Asia causing the death of 457 birds in Laos in March 2014.

 </sup> The H5N6 subtype arose from a reassortment event with HA genes from H5N1 and NA genes from the H6N6 virus.

 </sup> The H5N8 subtype caused an outbreak in 2014 in South Korea leading to a distinction of two different H5N8 virus subgroups, group A and group B.

 </sup> Group A comprises a set of H5N8 isolates and is referred to as the intercontinental group A (icA) group. The icA H5 viruses further evolved into three different subgroups, icA1, icA2, and icA3. The icA1 subtype group contains viruses that were isolated from Europe, Russia, and Japan. The icA2 subgroup is composed of H5N8 and HPAIV reassortants H5N2 and H5N1 from North America in 2014. The icA3 subgroup is composed of H5N8 viruses isolated in Japan and Korea.

 </sup> In 2014, H5N8 Eurasian subtypes emerged in Canada, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, and East Asia and was concurrently detected in the US state of Washington in captive falcons, wild birds, and poultry. It spread across US mid-western and north-central states causing devastation to the poultry industry. Over 48 million chickens and turkeys were culled, which led to a loss of US$1.6 billion.

 </sup> The spread of these intercontinental-like viruses coincided with bird migration out of Russia and most likely were spread by migratory birds.

  <xref rid="bibr78-2515135518821625" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>
 </sup> Clade 2.3.4.4 viruses are less pathogenic in wild waterfowl, which increases the chances of being spread through migratory birds.
