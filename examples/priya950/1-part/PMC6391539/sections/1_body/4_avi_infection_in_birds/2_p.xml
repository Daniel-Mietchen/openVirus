<p>Wild birds, such as ducks, are more resistant to H5N1 HPAIV infection compared with gallinaceous poultry.

 </sup> The rapid disease progression seen in infected chickens is not observed in ducks.

 </sup> Ducks are able to maintain H5 infections without developing severe disease and continue to spread the H5 virus into susceptible chicken populations.

 </sup> Infection with H5N1 in susceptible birds results in systemic infection, leading to multiple organ failure, damage to the cardiovascular and nervous systems, and ultimately death.

 </sup> Clinical signs of infection include loss of appetite, lack of energy, loss of coordination, discoloration and swelling of body parts, diarrhea, nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, and misshapen eggs.

 </sup> Diagnosis of AIV in birds is carried out by taking throat swabs of birds; in wild birds, a fecal sample is taken instead and is tested through PCR analysis. Positive PCR results then leads to virus isolation and growth of the virus in an embryonated chicken egg.
