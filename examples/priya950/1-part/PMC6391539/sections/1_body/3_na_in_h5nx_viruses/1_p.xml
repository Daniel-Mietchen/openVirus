<p>Characterization of LPAIV or HPAIV infections in poultry usually refers to the pathogenicity of the virus during infection and whether the virus contains a polybasic cleavage site in its HA molecule (as reviewed above). However other proteins, such as NA, can add to the pathogenic nature of the virus. To date, the newly circulating strains of AIV in China are H5N6, H5N8, and H5N2 of type H5Nx viruses.

 </sup> These viral reassortments can result in a dominant NA molecule that increases the pathogenicity and release of viral particles. Overall, this can increase viral transmission between hosts. The role of non-HA viral gene products and how these proteins contribute to viral tissue tropism and virulence are still not well understood. Multiple passages of H5N3 viruses in poultry result in a mutation in the catalytic site of NA, which increases the virulence of these viruses in poultry.

 </sup> Mutations in internal genes, such as PB2, have also been linked to increased viral pathogenicity in H5Nx viruses. Multiple passages of H5N5 viruses in mice resulted in a substitution in amino-acid position 627 from glutamic acid to lysine (E627K) in the HA protein.

 </sup> There were significant structural and functional differences in the NA proteins (N6, N8, and N2) from several viruses associated with the clade 2.3.4.4.

 </sup> The HA/NA interplay may be age dependent: whereas nonfunctional H5 viruses result in the death of day-old chickens, infection with the same virus in week-old chickens showed no signs of clinical illness at all.

 </sup> This seems to be an H5-specific phenomenon, whereas H7 viruses were less dependent on a functional NA to cause illness. The dominant AIVs that infected humans have been associated with H5N6 viruses from clade 2.3.4.4. Out of the 17 human infections with H5N6 virus, 16 of the viruses contain a NA stalk deletion. Recombinant H5N6 viruses containing a 10 amino acid NA stalk deletion (amino acids 58–68) had an increase of viral replication in mammalian cell lines compared with the intact NA of H5N6 viruses. These viruses containing the NA stalk deletion also showed an increased viral replication in avian CEF cells, whereas H5N2 virus had lower titers in these cells.

 </sup> This recombinant virus with the NA deletion (∆H5N6) did not infect neural tissue in mice, whereas the full length H5N6 recombinant virus was neurotropic.

 </sup> Wild-type H5N6 viruses had higher rates of viral transmission and were more lethal to poultry compared with the ∆H5N6 virus. Wild-type H5N6 viruses were 100% lethal to chickens. All birds died within 10 days postinfection, whereas, only 85% of the ∆H5N6 challenged chickens died by day 14 postinfection. These data suggest that the NA stalk region in H5N6 viruses plays an important role in pathogenicity in mammalian hosts and displayed a decreased pathogenicity in chicken cells.
