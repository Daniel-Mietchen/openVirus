<p>PB1-F2 is a small protein that is encoded from the same vRNA segment as PB2 from a +1 reading frame. PB1-F2 protein is an important virulence factor in influenza viruses and can have three roles in viral infection, that is (a) regulate antiviral innate immunity; (b) enhance viral polymerase activity; (c) induce cellular apoptosis.

 </sup> Viruses isolated from the 1997 H5N1 pandemic contained an amino acid at position N66S that correlated with high pathogenicity in mice.

 </sup> When an S66N mutation is introduced into the PB1-F2 protein of an H5N1 virus, there is an attenuation of disease in mice. Viruses that contain a N66S mutation have increased disease severity and production.

 </sup> The truncated version of PB1-F2 does not increase virulence in mice or their predisposition to co-infection by bacterial strains.

 </sup> However, the PB1-F2 protein that lacks an ATG start site was 1000-fold more pathogenic than the full length PB1-F2 containing an ATG site.

 </sup> The ability of H5Nx viruses to replicate successfully in human hosts is dependent on the adaptation of multiple viral RNA segments and are not restricted to HA and NA activity.
