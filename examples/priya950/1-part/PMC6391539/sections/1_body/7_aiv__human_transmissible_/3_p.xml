 </sup> The reported number of human infections has been decreasing since 2003. Although there have been a few cases of documented human-to-human transmission, these viruses are not easily transmitted in humans. This may reduce the threat of H5Nx viruses causing widespread infections in people and becoming a pandemic issue in the human population. However, the virus only needs to accumulate minor mutations in order for viruses with H5 HA proteins to transmit easily between mammalian hosts.

 </sup> One factor that may increase the pandemic potential of AIVs is the ability of these viruses to be transmitted through aerosolized particles.

 </sup> This is largely dependent on the ability of the virus to replicate in the upper respiratory tract of mammalian cells. Distribution of sialic acid receptors between human and avian hosts differ, with α-2,6 sialic acids being predominant in the upper respiratory tract of humans, and α-2,3 sialic acids being more predominant in the lower respiratory track of humans, whereas avian species have α-2,3 sialic acid receptors predominantly expressed in both the respiratory tract and digestive tract. Therefore, sustained human-to-human transmission of AIVs may also include the switch from α-2,3 sialic acid binding to preferentially α-2,6 sialic acid binding to ensure dissemination through aerosolized droplets from the upper respiratory tract.

 </sup> Sialic acid preference is not solely responsible for the pathogenicity of AIV in mammalian cells.

 </sup> AIV mutants that preferentially bind to α-2,6 sialic acid receptors have lower viral replication rates compared with wild-type viruses.

 </sup> Efficient transition for AIV to replicate in human hosts is dependent on more than receptor binding preference. Replication and release of these infectious particles are also critical when discussing the switch of infection from birds to mammals. A specific mutation in the polymerase protein PB2 in site 627 from a glutamic acid to a lysine (E627K) increases the pathogenicity of AIV infection in mammalian models.

 </sup> Influenza viruses that readily infect humans hosts predominantly display a lysine in site 627 in the PB2 protein. In avian species, the 627 site in the PB2 protein is glutamic acid. The function of PB2 is restricted in mammalian cells when these AIVs contain glutamic acid (E) in site 627. These viruses do not assemble into ribonucleoprotein complexes and have decreased genome transcription and virus production.

 </sup> The lysine (K) amino-acid substitution in the PB2 protein allows the virus to replicate in the lower temperatures of the upper respiratory tract of mammals (33°C), as opposed to the higher temperature (41°C) in the gastrointestinal tracts of avian species (117). H5N1 viruses that contain the PB2 E627K substitution have increased viral replication in the nasal passages of mice compared with viruses with the E627 wild-type virus.

 </sup> Other changes in PB2, such as the D701N mutation, have been associated with an increased animal tropism, increased polymerase activity, and enhanced pathogenicity in mammals. The SR polymorphism in PB2 allows the polymerase to escape species-specific restriction factors that target polymerases from AIVs.

 </sup> These mutations increase the overall viral replication of AIVs in mammalian hosts cells and ensure a high replicative titer and infection. Viral reassortments containing replicative proteins from multiple species can help AIVs to expand their tropism and adapt to new hosts.
