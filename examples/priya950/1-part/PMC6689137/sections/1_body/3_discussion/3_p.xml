<p>Recently, IOP was compared in patients with HIV under treatment and without treatment with the control group. The results were promising in knowing that the IOP of HIV patients was lower than the control, and there was a direct relationship with the amount of TCD4 in the patients, where HIV patients were 7 times more likely to have a decrease of IOP and if the TCD4 count was &lt;700 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> there is 13 times greater chance of having a reduction in IOP.
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This study obtained the same pattern of patient division. The results obtained were emphatic in describing that patients with HIV had lower IOP than the control group.
