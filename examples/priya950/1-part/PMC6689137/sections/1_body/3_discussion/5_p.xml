<p>A cohort compared patients with HIV with and without CMV co-infection.
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The mean IOP was 10.3 mmHg in the group with HIV and CMV and 12.7 mmHg in the group with HIV and without CMV. This data complements the above information, since CMV patients are found to have very low CD4+ and very high CD4 rates.
