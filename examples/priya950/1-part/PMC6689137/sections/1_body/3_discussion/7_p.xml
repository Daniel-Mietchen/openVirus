<p>Another study evaluated the dynamics of aqueous humor in patients with and without CMV retinitis.
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> They found that HIV was associated with lower water flow rates versus controls independent of CMV status. They concluded that the cause of lower IOP in HIV-infected individuals may be related to decreased aqueous production rather than increased output. The same authors also performed another analysis using PCR-RT to measure HIV VLin plasma and aqueous humor of patients with AIDS and ocular manifestations including CMV retinitis and HIV retinopathy. They observed a decrease in the levels of HIV viruses in the aqueous in these individuals after the initiation of ARVT and the recovery of the CD4+ T group.
