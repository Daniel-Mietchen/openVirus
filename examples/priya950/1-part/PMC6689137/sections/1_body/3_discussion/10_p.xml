<p>In none of the literature articles that investigated the IOP of HIV patients and compared with the control group, without the use of intravitreous medications, the patients’ pachymetry was evaluated. This fact is very important given that it may falsify the IOP. A thicker cornea can simulate a high IOP, just as the opposite is also true. This study compared the pachymetry of all patients and had their values adjusted based on articles with pachymetry documentation expected. An example is the study by Sánchez et al that documents the pachymetry with the value of 544.34 μm.
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A difference of 2.5 mmHg was observed for every 100 μm difference in corneal thickness. In this study, pachymetry was similar in the control and HIV controlled groups and higher in the HIV group without treatment. This difference is basically due to the fact that the number of patients is lower in the group with HIV without treatment.
