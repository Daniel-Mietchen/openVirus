<p>To evaluate the assumptions of ANOVA, the Bartlett test and the Shapiro–Wilk test of normality were used only in group 3, since it is the group with the lowest number of people. After ANOVA, the Tukey test was used to identify the groups in which the means are different. Similarly, after the Kruskal–Wallis test, the Dunn test was applied to identify which groups have different distributions.</p>
