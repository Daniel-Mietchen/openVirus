<p>In the logistic regression model, the stepwise variable selection method with the AIC criterion was also applied considering the same independent variables used in the linear regression model. The dependent variable of this model consists of the standardization of the IOP of OD variable. In this way, the binary variable low pressure was created. This variable assumes the value 1 for IOP values in OD of â‰¤10 mmHg and assumes the value zero for IOP values in OD &gt;10 mmHg. This same treatment was adopted by Young et al (2017).
