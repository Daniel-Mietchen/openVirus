<p>The Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test indicated that there was a difference between the IOP distributions of the three groups (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.000604). Dunn’s multiple-comparison test was used to identify which groups have different distributions. The comparisons that presented differences between in the group distributions (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) were groups 1 and 2 (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0007) and groups 1 and 3 (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0032), but were not confirmed due to differences between groups 2 and 3 (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0716).
