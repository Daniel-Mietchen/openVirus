 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the probability density function of the IOP OD of each group. The mode of group 1 is on the left of the mode of group 2 that in turn is in the left of the mode of group 3. The mode is the most frequent value; thus, it is the highest value in each group density.
