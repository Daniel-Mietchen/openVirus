  <title>Purpose</title>
  <p>To compare if patients with HIV have lower intraocular pressure than patients without HIV.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="S2002">
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>The association of intraocular pressure corrected by pachymetry and the relationship with viral load (VL) and TCD4 cells was studied. A total of 99 patients with HIV (91 who were on regular treatment and in control of the disease – group 1; and 8 who were without treatment – group 2) and 100 controls were studied.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Only age was of statistical significance; the group with HIV without control of the disease was the youngest. There was a decrease of −1.54 mmHg in the IOP of group 1 in relation to the controls and −3.63 mmHg in the IOP of group 2 in relation to the controls.</p>

 <sec id="S2004">
  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>HIV patients had lower IOP than the control population. However, the relationship between IOP, VL and TCD4 was not found.</p>
