  <p>Tukey test–95% family-wise confidence level.</p>

   <bold>Notes:</bold> The graph shows, for each combination of groups, the value of the difference between the means and their respective 95% CI. The vertical dashed line indicates the point where the difference between the means is equal to zero, that is, the means are equal. It is important to note that in the comparison between groups 1–2 and groups 1–3, the vertical line does not cut the 95% CI. The same does not occur between groups 2 and 3. Group 1: control group. Group 2: patients with controlled HIV disease. Group 3: patients with uncontrolled HIV disease.
