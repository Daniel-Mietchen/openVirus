<p>Pigs also suffered during the 1998/99 Malaysian outbreak, but this was only diagnosed as part of the investigation following the human cases. The severity of symptoms of NiV infection in pigs varied with age. In suckling pigs (&lt;4 weeks old), mortality could be high (up to 40%) and labored breathing and muscle tremors were evident. In growing pigs (1 to 6 months), an acute febrile (&gt;39.9°C) illness was observed with respiratory signs ranging from increased or forced respiration to a harsh, loud non-productive cough, open mouth breathing, and epistaxis (

In some cases these respiratory signs were accompanied by one or more of the following neurological signs: trembles, neuralgic twitches, muscle fasciculation, tetanic spasms, incoordination, rear leg weakness, or partial paralysis. Pigs of this age had high morbidity and low mortality (&lt;5%) (

Respiratory signs were reported in adult pigs, as with younger animals, although these were less obvious (labored breathing, bloody nasal discharge, increased salivation) and neurological signs included head pressing, bar biting, tetanic spasms and convulsions. First trimester abortions were also reported (
