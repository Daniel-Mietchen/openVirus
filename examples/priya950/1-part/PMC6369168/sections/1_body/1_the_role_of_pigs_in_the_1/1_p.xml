<p>In September 1998, there was an outbreak of severe febrile encephalitis among pig farmers in the state of Perak, Malaysia, that was associated with a high mortality rate. A total of 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 resulted in death, were confirmed. These deaths were initially thought to be due to Japanese encephalitis (JE), an endemic disease in Malaysia. However, with most cases occurring in men who worked with pigs, the epidemiological characteristics of this disease were distinct from those of JE, where ~75% of cases occur in children aged 0–14 years (

The NiV outbreak incurred significant economic costs and long-term damage to the Malaysian pig industry: US$582 million in direct costs and lost market revenue, including US$97 million in compensation to farmers for the 1.1 million pigs slaughtered and 36,000 jobs lost (
