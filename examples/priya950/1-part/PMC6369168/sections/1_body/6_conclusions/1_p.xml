<p>The NiV outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore demonstrated that pigs can play a key role in the epidemiology of NiV by acting as an amplifier host. The region most at risk of NiV infection has some of the highest pig population densities found anywhere in the world, which are rising fast due to the demand of a growing human population. This increases the risk of NiV transmission to pigs and humans. The development of a NiV vaccine for use in pig populations would decrease the major risk NiV poses to the developing pig industries, as well as to the livelihoods of poor livestock keepers in Southeast Asia. The use of non-human animal models is crucial for vaccine development against diseases such as NiV since efficacy testing in humans is impossible. The pig model may therefore contribute to human vaccine development, supporting human vaccine licensure under the Animal Rule.</p>
