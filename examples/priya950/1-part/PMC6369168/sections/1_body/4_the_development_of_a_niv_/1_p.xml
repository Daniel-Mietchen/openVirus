<p>The promising performance of experimental NiV and HeV vaccines in animal models and the licensure of Equivac® HeV, as a “One Health” vaccine to safeguard animal and human health, strongly support the proposition that a safe and effective NiV vaccine may be developed for pigs to reduce the severe economic consequences of NiV outbreaks and the threat to public health. With partners, we have initiated a project that aims to develop such a vaccine. We are systematically analyzing the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of three NiV vaccine candidates in pigs: (1) an adjuvanted NiV sG protein (orthologous to the Equivac® HeV vaccine), (2) NiV G protein delivered by a replication-deficient simian adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1 NiV G), and an adjuvanted, molecular clamp stabilized NiV F (mcsF) protein. ChAdOx1 is a multispecies vector with an established human and livestock safety profile (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The molecular clamp is a proprietary stabilization domain that preserves the F protein in its native “pre-fusion” form, which should enhance immunogenicity and thermostability. In depth analyses of T cell and antibody responses are being conducted to identify correlates of vaccine-induced protection. We will examine the durability of NiV-neutralizing antibodies and other immune responses associated with protection, including a comparison of a single-shot vs. homologous prime-boost immunization regimes. In-contact animals will be introduced to assess transmission of challenge virus from vaccinates or unvaccinated control animals.
