<p>An adjuvanted HeV sG protein subunit-based vaccine (Equivac® HeV, Zoetis) has been licensed in Australia to protect horses against HeV and to reduce the zoonotic risk to humans (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Equivac® HeV protects ferrets and African green monkeys (AGMs) after experimental challenge with NiV, as well as HeV (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Surprisingly, this vaccine failed to protect pigs from experimental NiV challenge (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Since the vaccine induced cross-neutralizing antibodies but not measurable T cell responses, the authors concluded that both arms of the adaptive immune response may be required for protection against NiV and HeV. These studies also potentially highlight that adjuvants can have species specific effects and tailoring of adjuvants to the target species may be required or considered in the context of preclinical models. The experimental viral vectored vaccine candidates for NiV include vesicular stomatitis virus, rabies virus, canarypox virus (ALVAC strain), adeno-associated virus (AAV), measles virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). ALVAC expressing NiV G or F (ALVAC-G and ALVAC-F) was found to protect pigs against NiV challenge 2 weeks after the second immunization (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). High titres of NiV neutralizing antibodies were induced with the ALVAC-G vaccine, while despite the low levels of neutralizing antibodies induced by the ALVAC-F; all vaccinated pigs were protected against virulent NiV challenge. Recombinant attenuated NDV expressing NiV glycoproteins have been shown to induce long lasting NiV-specific nAbs in pigs, with the vector expressing NiV G performing better than NiV F (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). However, no challenge was performed in this study and it remains to be determined whether these paramyxovirus-based vaccine candidates are efficacious. Compared to canarypox vectors, NDV-based vectors have a number of advantages including their high titer propagation in chicken eggs removing the requirement for cell culture (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Despite these encouraging results and the continued threat posed by NiV, no vaccine candidate has progressed toward market for either pigs or humans.
