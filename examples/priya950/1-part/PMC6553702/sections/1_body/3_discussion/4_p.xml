<p>At 2 weeks post-infection, the amounts of infectious particles and viral RNA in the epididymis, sperm/epididymal cells, and epididymal fluid were almost equal in PRVABC59- and ChibaS36-infected mice, but were clearly lower in NIID123-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Conversely, although no infectious particles were detected at 6 weeks post-infection, higher rates and titers of the viral genome were detected in sperm/epididymal cells and epididymal fluid from PRVABC59-infected mice than from ChibaS36-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). These findings suggest that the American-subtype strain might be maintained for a longer period than the Pacific-subtype strain in infected mice and that the Southeast Asian-subtype strain might possess the lowest proliferative potential or might be rapidly excluded from the infected mice. At 2 weeks post-infection, the infectious virus titer and viral RNA levels in the testis were markedly high in PRVABC59-infected mice, but no infectious virus was detected in ChibaS36- and NIID123-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). These results raise the possibility that PRVABC59 not only induces higher levels of viremia, but also exhibits a higher ability to proliferate in the testis compared with the other two strains. At 6 weeks post-infection, viral RNA was detected in the testis in 5/6 PRVABC59-infected mice and 1/6 ChibaS36-infected mice and all the testes in which viral genomes were detected were damaged (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g005">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g006">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g008">8</xref>). These data provide compelling evidence that persistent infection of testis with American- or Pacific-subtype ZIKV might represent the cause of testis damage in ZIKV-infected mice.
