<p>Our results demonstrated that infection with each of the three Asian/American-subtype strains used in this study was not lethal to IFNAR1-KO mice, whereas we previously demonstrated that infection with the African-lineage MR766 strain was lethal when the mice were inoculated with a lower infectious titer (1 Ã— 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU) of strain MR766 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In MR766-infected mice, high levels of infectious virus and viral RNA were detected in the central nervous system at 6 days post-infection. In contrast, no infectious virus was detected in the central nervous system in mice infected with any of the Asian/American-lineage strains (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, this does not exclude the possibility that MR766 was adapted to the mouse central nervous system because of the repeated past passaging of this strain in mouse brains for virus isolation and maintenance. In this study we examined the viral loads in the brain, spinal cord, liver, kidney, and spleen in ZIKV-infected mice at only one time point (6 days post-infection); therefore, further analysis may be needed to evaluate the detailed kinetics of viral load in the organs.
