<p>The observed phenotypes of the damaged testes in our experiments resembled those previously described [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007387.s002">S2 Table</xref>), which suggests that in humans, ZIKV infection might affect reproductive ability over an extended period. However, a recent report indicated that ZIKV infection produced no clear adverse effect on morphology or hormonal production in human testis explants [
