<p>Previously, we reported that Asian/American-lineage ZIKV strains can be classified into three subtypes based on amino acid sequences: the Southeast Asian subtype, Pacific subtype, and American subtype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the present study we showed that ZIKV strains of these three subtypes exhibited distinct growth properties in vitro and in vivo. ZIKV NIID123, which belongs to the Southeast Asian subtype, showed lower growth capacity in vitro and in vivo and exerted a weaker injurious effect on the testis and epididymis of mice compared with the other two strains. ZIKV PRVABC59 showed the highest growth capacity both in vitro and in most of the reproductive organs examined in mice and also induced maximal damage in the testis and epididymis of the three strains. These results raise the possibility that ZIKV have acquired elevated proliferative capacity and pathogenicity during the process of the virus spreading from Southeast Asia to the Americas through the Pacific islands.
