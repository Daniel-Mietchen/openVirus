<p>No statistically significant differences in viremia levels were observed among the four ZIKV-infected mouse groups at 6 days post-inoculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). However, no infectious virus was detected in the serum of any mice infected with NIID123. Viral RNA was detected in all mice infected with each strain; however, the viral RNA level in the NIID123-infected mice was the lowest among the four groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Infectious virus was detected in the brain and spinal cord of all mice infected with MR766, but not in any of the mice infected with the Asian/American-lineage strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). No infectious virus was detected in the liver and kidney of most of the mice infected with each of the four ZIKV strains. Infectious virus was detected in the spleen in 2/3 of ChibaS36-infected mice, but not in mice infected with PRVABC59 or NIID123. Viral RNA was detected in all tissues of mice infected with MR766, PRVABC59, or ChibaS36 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Viral RNA was not detected in the brain or spinal cord of 50% of the mice infected with NIID123. Furthermore, the viral RNA level in the tissues of mice infected with NIID123 was the lowest among the four groups.
