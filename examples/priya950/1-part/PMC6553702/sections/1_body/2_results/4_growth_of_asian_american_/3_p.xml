 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The levels of viral RNA in the serum, epididymal fluid, and sperm/epididymal cell specimens of PRVABC59-infected mice were higher than the levels in the specimens of ChibaS36-infected mice. No viral RNA was detected in any of the specimens of NIID123-infected mice.
