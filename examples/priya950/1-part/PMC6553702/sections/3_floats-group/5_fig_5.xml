  <title>Viremia/infectious virus and viral RNA levels in serum, epididymal fluid, epididymal cells including sperm (sperm/epididymal cells), testis, and epididymis of ZIKV-infected IFNAR1-KO mice.</title>
  <p>Mice inoculated with the Asian/American-lineage strains PRVABC59 (n = 6), ZIKV/Hu/Chiba/S36/2016 (n = 6), and ZIKV/Hu/NIID123/2016 (n = 6) were euthanized at 2 weeks (A and B) or 6 weeks (C and D) post-inoculation and serum, epididymal fluid, sperm/epididymal cell, testis, and epididymis samples were collected. Sera, epididymal fluid, sperm/epididymal cell, and tissue homogenates were used to quantify the infectious virus titer (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL or g) and the viral genome (genome copies/mL or g). (A and C) infectious virus titers and (B and D) copy numbers of the viral genome in serum, epididymal fluid, sperm/epididymal cells, testis, and epididymis of mice at 2 weeks (A and B) and 6 weeks (C and D) post-inoculation. Dotted line: detection limit. Significance was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test (*
