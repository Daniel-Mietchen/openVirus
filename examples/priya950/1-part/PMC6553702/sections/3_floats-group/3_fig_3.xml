  <title>Levels of viremia/infectious virus and viral RNA in ZIKV-infected IFNAR1-KO mice.</title>
  <p>Mice infected with MR766-NIID (n = 4), PRVABC59 (n = 3), ZIKV/Hu/Chiba/S36/2016 (n = 3), and ZIKV/Hu/NIID123/2016 (n = 3) were euthanized at 6 days post-inoculation and the blood, brain, spinal cord, liver, kidney, and spleen were collected. Sera and organ homogenates were prepared from the specimens and then used for determining the infectious virus titer (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL or g) and quantifying the viral genome (genome copies/mL or g). A) Infectious virus titers in sera and tissues and B) copy number of viral genome in sera and tissues. Dotted line: detection limit. Significance was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test (*
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
