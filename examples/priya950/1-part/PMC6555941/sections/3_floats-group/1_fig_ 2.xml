  <p>Molecular interaction between ZIKV NS4A protein and the type I IFN induction pathway. GAL4-based mammalian two-hybrid screening assays were performed to identify the molecular targets of ZIKV proteins in RIG-I signaling. 293T cells in 24-well plates were co-transfected with a pGL4.31 vector, a pFN11A (BIND) vector expressing a fusion protein of GAL4-BD and individual ZIKV prM, NS4A or DENV NS4A proteins, and a pFN10A (ACT) vector expressing 
   <bold>a</bold> RIG-I, 
   <bold>b</bold> MAVS, 
   <bold>c</bold> TBK1 or 
   <bold>d</bold> IKKε. The pFN11A (BIND) vector contained a 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase gene that was used as an internal control to normalize DNA transfection efficiency. The pBIND and pACT vectors were used as negative controls, and the pBIND-Id and pACT-MyoD vectors were used as positive controls (PCs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 48 h post-transfection, cell lysates were harvested for the luciferase activity assay. The results are shown as relative luciferase activity after normalization with 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity. Data are shown as the mean ± SD derived from three repeat experiments. *
