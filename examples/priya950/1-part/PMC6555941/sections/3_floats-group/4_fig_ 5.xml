  <p>ZIKV NS4A negatively regulates IFN production. 
   <bold>a</bold> Lysates of 293T cells co-transfected with RIG-I(N), IFN-β reporter, together with ZIKV NS4A (250, or 500 ng), DENV NS4A (250, or 500 ng), ZIKV prM (500 ng) or PB1-F2 (500 ng)were analyzed for luciferase activity. 293T cells were transfected with IFN-β reporter, together with ZIKV NS4A (250, or 500 ng), DENV NS4A (250, or 500 ng), ZIKV prM (500 ng) or PB1-F2 (500 ng), 
   <bold>b</bold> then infected with SeV at 100 HAU/ml for 24 h, 
   <bold>c</bold> or transfected with 20 μg/ml of poly(I:C) for 24 h followed by analysis of the cell lysates for luciferase activity. 
   <bold>d</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold> HFF-1 cells or 
   <bold>f</bold> PBMC were transfected with blank control vector or a vector expressing ZIKV NS4A (500 ng), DENV NS4A (500 ng), ZIKV prM (500 ng) or PB1-F2 (500 ng), respectively, and 24 h later were mock-infected or infected with SeV at 100 HAU/ml or transfected with or without 20 μg/ml of poly(I:C) for 24 h, followed by analysis of the supernatant for IFN-β protein levels.
