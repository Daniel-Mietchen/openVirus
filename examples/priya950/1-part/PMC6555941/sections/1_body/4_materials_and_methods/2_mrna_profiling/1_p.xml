<p id="Par51">Peripheral blood was collected from three patients during the onset period and from three healthy donors by using anticoagulant vacuum blood collection tubes (BD Franklin Lakes, NJ), and whole blood cells were subsequently collected by centrifugation at 800×
 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at room temperature. Total RNA was extracted from the collected blood cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Host cell transcriptional profiling was performed using RNA deep sequencing by employing the Annoroad Gene Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Briefly, library construction was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions provided by Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA). The prepared libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 PE150 platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. The raw sequencing data were submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] with GEO series accession number GSE123835. TopHat was used to analyze the RNA-seq data, and HTSeq v0.6.0 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] was adopted to generate the count matrix, with default parameters. Reads PerKilobase Million Mapped Reads (RPKM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] was then calculated to estimate the expression level of genes in each sample. DEGseq v1.18.0 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] was used for differential gene expression analysis between two samples with non-biological replicates. A 
 <italic>p</italic>-value was assigned to each gene and adjusted by Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as those displaying log
 <sub>2</sub> (fold change) ≥ 1.5 and a 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05 relative to the control cohort. Heatmaps were produced with the Gplots package and Heatmap.2 programs in R [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].
