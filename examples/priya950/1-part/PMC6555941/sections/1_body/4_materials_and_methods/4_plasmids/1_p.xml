<p id="Par53">The cDNA coding for each ZIKV protein, including prM, NS4A and NS4A-Flag (with a C-terminal Flag epitope tag), was PCR amplified from ZG-01 strain viral cDNA as a template and cloned into pFN11A (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA) or pcDNA3.1 vectors. Plasmids including pcDNA3.1-DENV NS4A, -IVA PB1-F2, -MAVS, -RIG-I (N), pFN10A (ACT)-RIG-I, -MAVS, -TBK1, and-IKKε were constructed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Truncated forms of MAVS (aa 1–77, 74–173 and 174–540) with N-terminal Flag epitope tags were amplified from the full-length template and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The pIFN-β-luc reporter plasmid was constructed by cloning a 125 bp fragment of the IFN-β promoter into the pGL3-Basic vector using the
