<p id="Par58">HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with the indicated plasmid. At 24 h after transfection, cells were washed once with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and treated for 30 min at room temperature with 10% BSA in PBS, followed by incubation with primary antibody for 1 h. Primary anti-Flag or anti-MAVS antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used, followed by incubation with FITC- or Rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and 4-,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)was used to stain the nuclei. The coverslips were washed extensively and fixed on slides, and images were taken under an LSM800 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany).</p>
