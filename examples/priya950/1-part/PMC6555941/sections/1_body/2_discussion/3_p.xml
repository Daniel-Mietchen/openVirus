<p id="Par47">At the molecular level, while antagonism of IFN-mediated signal transduction by ZIKV NS4A shares multiple similarities with that of DENV NS4A, our findings revealed that ZIKV NS4A bound MAVS through specifically interacting with both the CARD and TM domains of MAVS. As reported, the CARD-like domain of MAVS is responsible for interacting with RIG-I, and the TM domain-containing region of MAVS has been found to mediate oligomerization and interaction with other adaptor proteins, such as tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and TRAF6 [

Interestingly, type III IFN has been shown to protect barrier cells of the human placenta called trophoblasts from ZIKV infection. Type III IFN utilizes different cell-surface receptors than type I IFN but utilizes the same MAVS signaling machinery to regulate its production [

Thus, it is highly likely that ZIKV can also evade type III IFN signaling through targeting MAVS by NS4A, which may contribute to the ability of ZIKV to cross the placenta during pregnancy and consequently cause neuronal disorders in the developing fetus. Additionally, it would be of great interest to further identify the amino acids of MAVS responsible for the interaction between NS4A and MAVS. Since there is no three-dimensional structural information for NS4A, it is in fact very difficult to perform molecular docking experiments and identify the high-affinity binding sites between two proteins. Ding et al. revealed residues critical for ZIKV NS2B3-mediated cleavage to R78 and G79 in the cytoplasmic loop of human STING, but not mouse STING [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This finding needs to be further verified as residues R78 and G79 are only weakly conserved in the murine ortholog of STING. Human MAVS shares 51.8% amino acid identity with mouse MAVS, and thus, it may be of interest to further investigate whether NS4A can disrupt the interaction between mouse MAVS and its usual binding partners. Moreover, it might be equally important to further map the amino acids of ZIKV NS4A involved in IFN antagonism, which should allow generation of mutant ZIKVs that are attenuated due to their inability to prevent IFN signaling.
