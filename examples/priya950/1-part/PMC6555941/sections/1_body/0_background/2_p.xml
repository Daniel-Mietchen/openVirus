<p id="Par31">While it is beginning to be revealed that mutations in the prM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and NS1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] proteins might enable ZIKV to become more virulent and/or transmissible, mounting evidence suggests that innate immunity is involved in the governance of ZIKV replication and pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The interferon (IFN) system, being an essential component of innate immunity, constitutes the first line of defense against viral infection, including ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A vital role for the IFN system in abrogating ZIKV infection in the host was revealed by the fact that ZIKV is pathogenic in IFN receptor knockout mice but not in immunocompetent mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, Smith et al. demonstrated the neuropathogenesis of ZIKV in a highly susceptible immunocompetent mouse model after the function of type I interferon was blocked by an antibody [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These findings, together with several other lines of evidence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], support a notion that in order for a pathogenic infection to be established, ZIKV needs to attenuate the production of IFNs or the anti-viral effects of the IFN system.
