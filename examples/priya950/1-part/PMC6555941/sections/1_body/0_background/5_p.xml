<p id="Par34">Since MAVS signaling is essential for inducing an IFN production during ZIKV infection, it is plausible that viruses may hijack this important host response to facilitate infection of the host. Our previous findings revealed that DENV NS4A protein played an important role in suppressing interferon production through binding MAVS and disrupting the RIG-I–MAVS interaction [

Based on the possible functional similarities but mechanistic diversities by which the NS4A of the well-known flaviviruses DENV1-4 inhibits IFN signaling, we asked whether this paradigm applies to another member of the flavivirus group, ZIKV. This current study found that ZIKV interfered with the RIG-I–MAVS signaling to attenuate type I IFN production. More specifically, our results suggest that ZIKV NS4A targets MAVS and interrupts the RLR–MAVS interaction, leading to reduced induction of type I IFNs.
