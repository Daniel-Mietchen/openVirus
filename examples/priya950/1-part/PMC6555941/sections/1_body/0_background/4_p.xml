<p id="Par33">It is well established that viruses have co-evolved with their hosts, accompanied by development of multiple strategies to evade and antagonize the host IFN system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that most flaviviruses have evolved diverse strategies to abrogate the induction of IFN and the downstream signaling pathways. Currently available data suggest that ZIKV infection can inhibit type I IFN responses in dendritic cells (DCs) through downregulation of IFN-stimulated genes and impair DC function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], yet the interferon response in other cell types remains unknown. ZIKV genome codes for a single polyprotein that is post-translationally, proteolytically processed by viral and host proteases to produce ten proteins, including three structural proteins (capsid, membrane precursor, and envelope), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The ZIKV nonstructural proteins NS1, NS2B3, NS4B, and NS5 have been implicated to be engaged in ZIKV immuno pathogenicity through diverse strategies. For example, NS1 and NS4B of ZIKV inhibit RLR-induced IFN-β production via interacting with TBK1 and thereby blocking TBK1 oligomerization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. NS2B3 impairs the IFN signaling pathway by facilitating proteasomal degradation of Jak1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and STING [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, ZIKV NS5 has been found to bind and degrade host STAT2 and consequently block the IFN response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It remains to be determined whether other viral factors also contribute to the evasion of the innate immune response by ZIKV.
