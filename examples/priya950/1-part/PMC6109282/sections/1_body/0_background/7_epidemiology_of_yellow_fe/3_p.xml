<p id="Par27">The endemic zone of YF is located in the Amazon and encompasses, to the west, Peru and Colombia, to the north the Guyana plateau (Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam and French Guiana), and to the northeast, Brazil. The description of the sylvatic cycle was made on the occasion of the great 1942 epidemic in Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The circulation of the virus seems persistent, even if the detailed mechanisms were not yet discovered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. It is notable, for example, that specific immunity is maintained in monkeys from many parts of Brazil, even outside the Amazon, regardless of epidemic episodes, suggesting a regular infection of the monkeys by the virus resulting in a lasting immunization in survivors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. While the general pattern remains fairly similar to the African one (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), there are some important differences. First, the American monkey is susceptible to the YF virus and many individuals die from it [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Thus, it not only plays the role of amplifying YF endemia as in Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] but also reveals the risk of epidemics: periodic epizootics that occur near inhabited regions are used as a warning signal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In addition, the vectors are different – at least within the jungle cycle – in which 
 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> and 
 <italic>H. leucocelaenus</italic> play an essential role while other species (including 
 <italic>H. capricornii</italic>) or genera, notably 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, are little involved in the transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> represent a major risk of spreading YF in urban and peri-urban areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>].
