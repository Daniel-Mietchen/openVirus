<p id="Par20">Endemic areas are those where the virus circulates between some 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species, notably 
 <italic>A. africanus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. furcifer</italic>, and non-human primates, especially arboreal monkeys [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In Africa, monkeys are resistant to the YF virus and, if they become infected or sick, do not die but rather become immune [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Humans are not present within the endemic areas and may be accidentally infected during a short forest stay, which can lead to sporadic cases and/or limited epidemics leading to the immune protection of the population and restricting the risk of local epidemics. In the zone of emergence, most often in villages bordering forest and savannah or sometimes in extensive plantations, some 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species, particularly 
 <italic>A. furcifer</italic>, leave the plant coverage, penetrate the inhabited areas and bite humans that they infect [
