<p>NA is assembled as homotetramers when embedded in the envelope of the virus, with each of the monomers folding into four distinct structure domains: the cytoplasmic tail, the transmembrane region, the stalk and the catalytic head [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00458-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The cytoplasmic tail, of which the sequence is nearly 100% conserved across all IAV subtypes, plays a critical role during NA transport and incorporation [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The N-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain, however, contains a variable sequence of amino acids spanning residues 7â€“29 and provides signals for translocation to the apical membrane and lipid raft association [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The stalk domains of different NA subtypes vary considerably in the number and sequence of amino acid residues, therefore, in the length, depending on which the NA tetramers may protrude slightly more or less above the viral envelope than the HA trimers. These differences can impact the NA enzymatic activity and virulence [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The catalytic head domain possesses the ability to cleave SA from nearby membrane glycoproteins to prevent virus trapping [
