<p>The function of NA the during release of the newly budded virions from host cells has long been well demonstrated, however, the roles of NA in IAV entry remain under-appreciated [

NA is involved in IAV entry likely in two ways: first, NA may play a role in direct receptor binding, complementing the receptor-binding function of HA; second, NA may help to release virions bound to the sialylated “decoy” receptors, facilitating virus movement on cell surface, therefore enabling HA access to SA expressed by entry receptors and subsequent efficient endocytosis [
