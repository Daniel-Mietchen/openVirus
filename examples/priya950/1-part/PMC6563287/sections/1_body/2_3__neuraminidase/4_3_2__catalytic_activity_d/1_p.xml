<p>It has been well accepted that NA activity and cleavage of SA enables movement of the virion through airway mucus during infection [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The sialylated mucins within airway mucus may serve as a trap by presenting decoy receptors to which influenza virus binds, followed by mucociliary clearance [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that IAV interacts with the secreted mucus on human airway tissue, and bead-bound mucins inhibit the NA cleavage of the substrate [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Moreover, NA inhibitors have been shown to block IAV entry into cell cultures of human airway epithelium, while exogenous NA enhanced virus passage through the mucus layer [

 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This suggests that the catalytic activity of NA is essential to remove decoy SAs presented on mucins so that the virus can get access to functional receptors on the target cell surface.
