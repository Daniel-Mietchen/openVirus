<p>The catalytic activity of NA is crucial during virus migration, and HA and NA competitively cooperate as motile machinery to move IAV particles on the cell surface [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00458-f002">Figure 2</xref>, after binding of IAV to the SA decorated surface via HA, the NA may degrade SAs near the attachment site, creating a receptor density gradient that enables the rolling of virus particles on the surface. The recent development of a biolayer interferometry assay was used to study the dynamic and motile interaction of HA/NA-receptor during the initial infection of IAV and demonstrated the contribution of NA to virus-receptor binding and NA-dependent rolling on receptor-containing surfaces [
