<p>The influenza A virus (IAV) and type B virus (IBV) genomes each contain eight segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded viral RNA (vRNA) segments, coding for at least 11 proteins, of which hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the major surface glycoproteins [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. IAVs can be further classified into subtypes based on HA and NA antigenicity. To date, many combinations of 16 HA (H1-16) and 9 NA (N1-9) subtypes have been identified in wild birds, while two additional subtypes (H17N10 and H18N11) have recently been isolated in bats [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Two subtypes of IAVs (H1N1 and H3N2) and two antigenically distinct lineages of IBVs (Victoria and Yamagata) currently co-circulate in humans [
