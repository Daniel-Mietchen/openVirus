<p>The distribution of NA on the virion may also affect the NA accessibility. Cryoelectron tomography studies have shown that IAV virions can be sorted into five classes based on their appearance in tomograms, and the NA tetramer exists mainly in two manners: the single NA spikes surrounded by HA, and local clusters of NA [
