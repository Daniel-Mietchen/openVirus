<p>The noncoding regions (NCRs) of the eight segmented viral RNAs (vRNAs) of IAV consist of the highly conserved promoter region and the nonconserved segment-specific NCRs at both the 3′ and 5′ ends [

 <xref rid="B96-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Nucleotides in the nonconserved segment-specific region are highly conserved both in the sequence and the length for the same segment of different IAV strains, except for the two subtype-determinant HA and NA segments, which are further subtype-specific [
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Although the diversity in the subtype-specific NCRs of HA and NA segments has received little attention, they are proposed to affect vRNA synthesis, protein expression and genome packaging, which might subsequently influence the amounts of HA and NA on the virion surface, as well as HA:NA ratio [

 <xref rid="B101-viruses-11-00458" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This hypothesis is supported by the recent findings which show that HA NCR plays an important role in vRNA transcription and virus infectivity [
