<p>Neither HA binding affinity nor NA activity alone can guarantee a successful infection, replication or transmission, but a real stable balance between the HA and NA contributes good viral fitness (

Upon treatment with NA inhibitor drugs, several H3N2 virus isolates from the patients were shown to have little or no NA activity, in correspondence with which a weak binding HA was found [
