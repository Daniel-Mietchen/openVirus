<p>With respect to the complementary and opposite effects of HA and NA on SA binding, it is imperative that the relative activity of the two proteins is balanced, preventing the activity of one from overwhelming the role of the other; i.e., HA and NA competitive cooperation during the infection initiation and release of the newly formed virions. Three situations usually affect HA/NA balance: (i) adaptation to a new SA expression pattern after interspecies transmission occurs; (ii) antigenic drift, and (iii) presence of antivirals targeting either HA or NA [

Since the recent study emphasized that ICV may infect the lower respiratory tract, and cause more severe disease and periodic outbreaks, while IDV also poses a potential threat to human health as an emerging pathogen, it is important to understand the characteristics of HEF proteins regarding the functional balance [
