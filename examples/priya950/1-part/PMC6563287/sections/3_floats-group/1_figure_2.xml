  <p>Representative model for influenza A virus moving on sialic acid (SA) decorated surface. In order to infect a target host cell, the virus might need to move either across airway mucus to reach the target cell or on the cell surface to access an entry receptor. After viral attachment, the NA could degrade SAs near the attachment site, resulting in reduced SA density; the SA density gradient promotes virus moving until successful infection occur.</p>
