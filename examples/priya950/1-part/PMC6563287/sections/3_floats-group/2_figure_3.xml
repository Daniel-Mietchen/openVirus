 <caption>
  <p>The relative HA binding affinity and NA activity need to be balanced for efficient entry. (
   <bold>a</bold>) If the HA and NA are mismatched and the NA activity is suboptimal, the virus may remain bound to decoy receptors, blocking virus movement and entry. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Efficient cleavage of SA from decoy receptors by NA enables HA access to the right entry receptors, followed by efficient endocytosis. (
   <bold>c</bold>) In the case that NA activity is too strong when compared to HA binding affinity, every binding attempt of the virus via HA will be disrupted by NA cleavage, resulting in failed binding.
