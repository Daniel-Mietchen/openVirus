  <p>Cartoon structures of the spikes of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). (
   <bold>a</bold>) The HA spike is formed by an HA trimer. Each HA monomer contains two functional domains, the receptor binding globular domain and the helix-rich stalk domain. (
   <bold>b</bold>) NA exists as a tetramer of four identical monomers. Each NA monomer consists of four distinct structure domains, including the catalytic head, the stalk, the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic tail.
