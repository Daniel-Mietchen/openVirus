 <p>The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of influenza A virus possess antagonistic activities on interaction with sialic acid (SA), which is the receptor for virus attachment. HA binds SA through its receptor-binding sites, while NA is a receptor-destroying enzyme by removing SAs. The function of HA during virus entry has been extensively investigated, however, examination of NA has long been focused to its role in the exit of progeny virus from infected cells, and the role of NA in the entry process is still under-appreciated. This review summarizes the current understanding of the roles of HA and NA in relation to each other during virus entry.</p>
