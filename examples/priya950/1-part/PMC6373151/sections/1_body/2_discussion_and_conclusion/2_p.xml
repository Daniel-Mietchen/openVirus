<p id="Par22">The patient in the present study had typical clinical features of severe HFMD. The patient showed hemiplegia, bilateral pupil asymmetry, shallow breathing, and sluggish pupillary light reflex. The diagnosis of brain stem encephalitis was established based on the above clinical symptoms by specialists in the Department of Neurology and the Department of Infectious diseases, although the CT and MRI showed no abnormality at that moment. EV71 RNA was detected in faeces by RT-PCR. The Chinese National Centre for Disease Control and the guidelines for the prevention and control of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease in China recommend the use of RT-PCR for detection of virus in the stool and oropharyngeal secretions due to the high positive rate. Moreover, detection of EV71 in stool samples by RT-PCR is widely used in clinical settings to monitor the development of HFMD [
