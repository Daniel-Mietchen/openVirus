<p id="Par21">HFMD is an acute infectious disease caused by a group of enteroviruses, among which EV71 and CVA are the most common pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The symptoms are generally mild and self-limiting. The main clinical manifestations are fever, rash, and ulcers in oral mucosa, over hands, feet, and buttocks. A small proportion of paediatric patients are known to develop severe complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and circulatory failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Since the first report in the year 1958, HFMD outbreaks have been reported in East and Southeast Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Since 2008, several epidemics of HFMD have been reported in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. HFMD caused by EV71 may be associated with severe, potentially life-threatening complications in children, such as brainstem encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, flaccid paralysis, heart failure, and lung failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Approximately 10–30% of the hospitalized patients during EV71-associated HFMD epidemics in Asia reportedly developed a spectrum of neurological complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Brainstem encephalitis, a distinctive form of encephalitis with typical neuropathological characteristics, has been the hallmark of severe HFMD during EV71 epidemics in Asia, which began in the late 1990s. Approximately 45% of mild, 80% of severe, and 93% of critically-ill paediatric cases of HFMD in China are known to be caused by EV71 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, EV71 infection also caused three deaths among HFMD children in Singapore in the year 2001 [
