<p id="Par25">World Health Organization as well as HFMD epidemic countries have developed guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HFMD, including the staging and classification of HFMD. Different treatments are employed for respective phases of HFMD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. According to the above guidelines, in this case, gamma immunoglobulin therapy that was initiated immediately after the onset of severe neurological complications, combined with other treatments, resulted in the rapid improvement of the manifestations. Milrinone is a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor with both inotropic and vasodilator effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It was shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe HFMD with cardiopulmonary collapse in a small randomised controlled open-label trial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We also found that in the treatment of severe HFMD, milrinone in combination with hydrochloride esmolol helps reduce the heart rate and maintain cardiopulmonary function.
