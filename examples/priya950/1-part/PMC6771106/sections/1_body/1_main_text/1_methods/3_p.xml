<p id="Par23">Computational predictions of the targets of differentially expressed human miRNAs (defined by adjusted p-value &lt; 0.001 and log2 fold-change &gt; 1) were performed using public databases with different algorithms: Diana microT CDS (v.5.0) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], filtering with a threshold of 0.95; TargetScan (v.7.1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], sorting on a total context score &lt; 0.15; and miRDB (v.5.0) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with a target threshold &gt; 85. The human miRNAs were also input into public online repositories of experimentally-validated data on molecular interactions: miRecords (release 2013) and miRTarBase (v.7.0) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], set to ‘strong evidence’.
