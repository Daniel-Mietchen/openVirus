<p id="Par25">RNA sequencing yielded 1.61–2.87 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> reads per replicate (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Filtering for size, 91–97% of trimmed sequences were mapped to the human genome. 814 human miRNAs were identified (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), and multidimensional scaling showed separation between results for EBOV- and mock-infected human RPE cells (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Defining differential expression as adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, 28 and 61 miRNAs were significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in EBOV-infected cells. Filtering stringently for adjusted p-value &lt; 0.001 and log2 fold-change &gt; 1, 13 and 2 miRNAs were significantly increased and decreased (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). EBOV-miR-1-5p, EBOV-miR-T1-3p, EBOV-miR-T1-5p and EBOV-miR-T3-5p/T4-5p were identified in the infected human RPE cells (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).
