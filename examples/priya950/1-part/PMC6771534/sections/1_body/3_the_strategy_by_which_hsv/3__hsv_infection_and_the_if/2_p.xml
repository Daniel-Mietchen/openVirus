<p>Studies on antiviral innate immunity have indicated that IFN‐α/β and their family members, as defenses against viral small molecules, could be indicators of effective antiviral mechanisms and play important roles in controlling viral spread at primary infection sites through stimulating various cells to express molecules that inhibit virus proliferation.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0100" ref-type="ref">100</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">101</xref> Indeed, studies of HSV pathogenesis have suggested that the expression of IFN‐α/β or IFN‐λ in epithelial cells can be observed,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">102</xref> which is related to not only viral surface glycoprotein binding to cell receptors
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0103" ref-type="ref">103</xref> but also viral PAMPs interacting with cellular PRRs as the virus replicates in infected cells. Detection of intracellular viral products by toll‐like receptor (TLR), cGAS, RLR, and p204/STING activates signaling pathways resulting in ISG‐encoded products as well as driving tetherin expression.

 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">104</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0105" ref-type="ref">105</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0106" ref-type="ref">106</xref> Although this process suggests the activation of the innate immune response during HSV infection, subsequent observations have indicated that this IFN reaction is unable to block viral spread to the target neural tissue, as viral proliferation in epithelial tissue induces vesicle lesions in most infected individuals.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0107" ref-type="ref">107</xref> Studies of this process suggest that various virally encoded molecules, most of which are tegument proteins, are capable of interacting with different components of the IFN signaling pathway and the NF‐κB transcriptional network and interfering with signal transduction and the transcription of IFN mRNA transcripts. The viral immediate gene product ICP0 was found to be capable of blocking the translocation of the DNA‐binding protein p65 to the cell nucleus in the NF‐κB pathway and promoting the enzymatic proteolysis of p50, which possesses a function similar to that of p65.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0108" ref-type="ref">108</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">109</xref> On the other hand, ICP0 was found to be capable of interacting with the IFI16 protein and downregulating its phosphorylation to assist cGAS in sensing viral double‐stranded DNA (dsDNA) during viral genomic replication, which could interfere with signal transduction in the IFN pathway.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0110" ref-type="ref">110</xref> The HSV tegument protein Us3 was observed to inhibit the activation of NF‐κB by superphosphorylating p65 in virus‐infected cells and to block the translocation of superphosphorylated IRF‐3 into the nucleus, which could directly inhibit IFN production.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0111" ref-type="ref">111</xref> This process could be involved in the variations in either inflammatory factors and/or chemokines during HSV infection.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0112" ref-type="ref">112</xref> Other virus‐encoded proteins, such as ICP27, enable the inhibition of NF‐κB by interacting with IκBα,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0113" ref-type="ref">113</xref> and UL42 inhibits NF‐κB activity by interacting with the p65/50 complex and retaining this complex in the cytoplasm.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0114" ref-type="ref">114</xref> The tegument protein VP16 interacts with p65 and represses NF‐κB while interfering with the binding of CREB to the IRF‐3 complex to block the IRF‐3 transcriptional process.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0115" ref-type="ref">115</xref> Another tegument protein, Vhs, binds to the mRNAs of IFN‐stimulated genes to promote their degradation and leads to reduced antiviral activity of IFN members.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">85</xref> An important viral protein, γ‐34.5, targets TBK1 to block its interaction with IRF‐3 and repress IFN production,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0116" ref-type="ref">116</xref> and viral VP24 interacts with both TBK1 and IRF‐3 to block signal transduction and repress IFN expression.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0117" ref-type="ref">117</xref> These observations provide extensive evidence that HSV interferes with IFN production (Figure 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These data demonstrated that an innate response that relies on IFN might not restrain the neurotropic spread of HSV from primary infected epithelial tissues to neurons. It should be stressed that various immune signals, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) members and cytokines including interleukins (IL‐1, IL‐4, IL‐13, IL‐17, IL‐22, and IL‐33), which could play important roles in the activation of various innate immune cells and are regulated by the NF‐κB transcription system, are equally crucial for IFN production.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0118" ref-type="ref">118</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0119" ref-type="ref">119</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0120" ref-type="ref">120</xref> Thus, the signaling network that activates and regulates processes in the innate immune system during the initial response to HSV infection can be disrupted by virus‐encoded molecules.
