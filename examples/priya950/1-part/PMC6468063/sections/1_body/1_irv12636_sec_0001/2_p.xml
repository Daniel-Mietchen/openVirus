<p>We recently studied the association between climatic parameters and weekly influenza‐like illness (ILI) activity in the Netherlands during 1970‐2016, and reported two main results.
 <xref rid="irv12636-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> First, weekly absolute humidity was inversely associated with 1‐ and 2‐week lagged ILI incidence; second, the seasonal average absolute humidity was correlated, in an ecological analysis, with the seasonal average ILI incidence (similar results were obtained using temperature instead of absolute humidity, although to a slightly lesser degree). The relationship between climatic parameters and ILI incidence was therefore observed both within and between seasons. In particular, we found that season average ILI incidence rate in the Netherlands has started to rise again since the early 2000s after three decades of marked decline, and this has coincided with a trend reversal of seasonal average absolute humidity, which took place approximately in the same years. The latter finding is of particular interest because several of the factors (other than climate change) that can affect the transmission of respiratory viruses and whose changes are often hypothesized as possible drivers of long‐term trends in influenza incidence (eg, hygienic standards, social contact patterns, household size, urbanization level, patterns of mobility, and others) do not appear to be able to explain why ILI incidence has started to rise again in the last fifteen years in the Netherlands. Ecological studies are never conclusive and require confirmation in analytical studies, yet we believe that climate change should always be considered when looking into, or speculating about, causes of long‐term trends in the incidence of respiratory viral diseases.
