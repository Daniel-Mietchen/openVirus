<p id="Par31">In accordance with previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], this study selected four environmental factors (mean temperature [Temp], mean relative humidity [Hum], mean precipitation [Pre], and normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) that temporally correspond to the epidemic data (from April to November). In addition, four socioeconomic variables in 2010 (land use data, population size, road density, and GDP) were obtained to reflect the regional social conditions. All variables (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for details on data processing) were calculated from original data of 1 km
 <sup>2</sup> resolution, and the spatial distribution of these factors is illustrated in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and
