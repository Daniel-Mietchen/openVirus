<p id="Par27">In the absence of effective vaccines, domestic and foreign scholars have conducted a large number of studies on factors, that affect the spread and prevalence of DF epidemics, such as the dengue virus, mosquito vectors, susceptible population, and environmental and socioeconomic factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Among these factors, environmental conditions, such as climate, hydrology, and vegetation, mainly affect the activity of the dengue virus, the breeding environment, and mosquito vector activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Socioeconomic factors, such as population density, land use, transportation convenience, residents’ income level, and living habits, play an important role in DF epidemics by changing both the probability of bites from the mosquito vectors and their activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Previous studies on the epidemic scale, spatiotemporal characteristics, and influencing factors of DF have deepened our understanding of DF characteristics in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, additional knowledge is needed regarding the spatial-temporal characteristics of the epidemic in China’s typical DF epidemic areas and the differences in influencing factors. Our study was performed to 1) analyse the spatial-temporal pattern of DF epidemics in two regions and 2) use a generalized additive model (GAM) to analyse and compare the main influencing factors affecting the spatial disparities of DF in the two regions. The results of this study will provide important support for strengthening the prevention and control of DF outbreaks in the PRD and BYM and raising the level of prevention of DF risk.
