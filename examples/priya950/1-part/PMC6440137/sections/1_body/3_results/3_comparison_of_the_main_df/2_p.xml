<p id="Par42">Compared with the PRD, the DF epidemic in the BYM was relatively clustered in urban areas and showed gentle fluctuations with increases in ULR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B1). The ULR of the areas with relatively serious DF epidemics was approximately 0.07 and 0.3, and DF epidemics showed a wave rise as the road density increased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B2). Although the DF epidemic and the NDVI (ranking first among environmental factors) also showed an ‘M’ relationship in the BYM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B3), the NDVI value in relatively severe epidemic areas was 0.39–0.61. In addition, the DF epidemic was relatively serious in the BYM where the average Temp was higher than 17.8 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B4), the WLR was between 0.15 and 0.20 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B5), and the Pre was approximately 180 mm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B6). In general, the main factors (socioeconomic and environmental factors) and their nonlinear relationships with DF epidemics in the PRD and BYM were significantly different.
