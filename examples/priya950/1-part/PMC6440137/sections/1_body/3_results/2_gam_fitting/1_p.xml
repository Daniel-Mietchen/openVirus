<p id="Par39">Pearson correlation coefficient analysis (see Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and variable collinearity analysis (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>) show that strong collinearity occurred in both the PRD (among the urban land ratio [ULR], road, and GDP; among Pop, Road, and GDP; and between the forest land ratio and NDVI) and the BYM (among Pop, ULR, and GDP; and between Hum and Pre). In each region, the model that passed the collinear diagnosis with the lowest AIC value was used as the optimal model for the DF epidemic to avoid over fitting of the model (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Thus, the optimal GAM of the DF epidemic in the PRD consisted of five variables (Pop, ULR, NDVI, Hum, and Temp), and that in the BYM consisted of six variables (ULR, Road, NDVI, Temp, water land ratio [WLR], and Pre). The total variance of the GAM for the DF epidemic was 83.4% (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.834, PRD) and 97.3% (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.973, BYM), which shows that the GAM fit the regional differences of the epidemic well.
