<p id="Par50">Several limitations are worth noting. (1) The difference in the severity of the two regional epidemics leads to a significant difference in the confidence interval of the fitting curve, although it does not affect the research paradigm. (2) The effects of mosquito vector and control measures have not been sufficiently considered, and these data should be included in our future work. (3) The spatial correlation between DF epidemics and various influencing factors has not been properly considered in the model, and models such as the GWR, which can consider such spatial correlations, should be included in future studies. (4) This study used the number of DF cases from 2010 to 2014 as the dependent variable, without carefully analysing the lagging effect and temporal effect between DF and its influencing factors.</p>
