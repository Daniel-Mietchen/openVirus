<p id="Par49">As for imported cases of DF, the BYM has several ports through which DF is mainly imported by “ground”, including Jinghong Port, Simao Waterway Port, and the busiest port of Rili to Myanmar. These wide ranges of trade ports promote local economic development but also increase the risk of imported DF cases because DF is highly prevalent in areas adjacent to Laos and Myanmar. In addition, Wang et al. confirmed that the local DF epidemic in the BYM in 2013 was caused by imported cases from the neighbouring countries of Southeast Asia [

Meanwhile, as one of the most densely populated areas in China, more than one million migrant workers travel to the PRD each year. These people live in crowded and poor sanitary conditions and less rectified living areas, which are conditions conducive to human-mosquito contact [

The BYM and PRD are both important ports of land and sea-air entry and exit in China, and they are popular locations for tourists and migrant workers in China. If DF epidemics develop explosive outbreaks in both regions without being effectively controlled, they will spread to adjacent inland areas, which will cause serious impacts to the life and health of people in inland areas. Therefore, the health departments must consider the spatial differentiation characteristics of the main factors affecting DF epidemics in the region and utilize these data to formulate more specific prevention and control strategies.
