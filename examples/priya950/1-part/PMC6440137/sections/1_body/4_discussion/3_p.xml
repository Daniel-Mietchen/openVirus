<p id="Par46">As for the second similarity of the characteristics of DF epidemic in these two regions, Ren et al. considered that socioeconomic factors might play a significant role in DF epidemics in cases where environmental factors were suitable and differed slightly in regional [

Although the socioeconomic status (Pop, ULR, and Road) of the PRD is significantly greater than that of the BYM, these two regions present similar differences in development, and this finding can also be confirmed that the coefficient of variation of socioeconomic factors is significantly higher than that of environmental factors. In addition, Zhu et al. noted that a certain degree of population aggregation was an important condition for DF transmission and prevalence [

The population is relatively clustered in towns of the BYM (such as Dehong and Xishuangbanna) and the highly urbanized regions of the PRD (such as Guangzhou-Foshan). Therefore, this condition gives a reasonable explanation for the relatively serious epidemic in these areas. In recent years, the PRD has implemented active prevention and control measures, such as water retention and mosquito prevention, and DF epidemics have been effectively controlled. Therefore, based on the similarities between the two regions regarding the spatial patterns and main influencing factors underlying DF epidemics, we suggest that the BYM can draw on the experience of the PRD when formulating DF epidemic prevention and control strategies at the regional level.
