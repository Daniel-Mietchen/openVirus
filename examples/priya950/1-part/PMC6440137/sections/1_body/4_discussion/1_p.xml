<p id="Par44">In this study, we used the GAM to analyse and compare the main factors that affect the differences between DF epidemics in the PRD and BYM on the grid scale. Strengthening our understanding of the spatial-temporal patterns and differences between the influencing factors of DF epidemics in Chinaâ€™s typical DF epidemic areas is of considerable significance because such data can improve our ability to prevent and control the DF risk in high-incidence areas.</p>
