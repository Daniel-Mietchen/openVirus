<p id="Par47">Compared with the similarities listed above, the differences in the DF epidemic characteristics between the PRD and the BYM should be further investigated. Regarding the socioeconomic factors, previous studies have shown that a higher ULR corresponded to a larger population, while developed transport networks increased the mobility of people in the region [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The extent and concentration of DF epidemics in the PRD are higher than those in the BYM, which is closely related to the higher Pop, higher ULR, uniform road network distribution, and stronger population mobility. The ULR of the BYM is high only in the central town areas of Dehong and Xishuangbanna (but still lower than that of the PRD), as are Pop and Road. The accessibility of roads throughout the region is not as good as that in the PRD, which can also explain why DF epidemics in the PRD are significantly greater than those in the BYM.
