<p id="Par45">The epidemic characteristics of the PRD and BYM have quite a few similarities in environmental and socioeconomic factors. Regarding environmental conditions, previous studies have shown that suitable meteorological conditions (Temp at 20–30 °C and Hum of 75%) were conducive to mosquito breeding and reproduction [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], thereby promoting dengue virus activity and increasing the risk of DF epidemics and transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. According to the basic data of this study, the monthly mean Temp in the PRD and BYM is between 10 °C and 27 °C from April to November, the monthly mean Pre is 0–360 mm, and the relative Hum is 63–84%. These warm and humid weather conditions are conducive to DF transmission. In addition, the vegetation conditions in these two regions are good (the average NDVI is 0.57 to 0.81). Higher or lower NDVI values will reduce the risk of DF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. High NDVI values generally indicate sparsely populated areas that are unable to meet the conditions of human and mosquito contact for DF. The appropriate vegetation conditions provide not only excellent conditions for the breeding and activity of mosquitoes (
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is primarily observed in the PRD, and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is primarily observed in the BYM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] but also cool locations in summer for humans, thereby increasing the probability of contact between humans and mosquitoes and promoting DF epidemic risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The warm and humid environmental conditions in the BYM and PRD are suitable for mosquito breeding and activity, which is an important reason for the rapid and widespread prevalence of DF and presents the first similarity of DF epidemics in these two regions.
