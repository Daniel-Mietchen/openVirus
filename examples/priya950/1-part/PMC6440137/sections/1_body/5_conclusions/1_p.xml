<p id="Par51">The environmental and socioeconomic factors in the PRD and BYM may affect the spatial-temporal differentiation of DF epidemics, and the influencing mechanisms have their own regional characteristics. The differences in socioeconomic factors are more obvious in cases where environmental factors are suitable and differ slightly throughout areas. This study has improved our understanding of the spatial distribution of DF epidemics and their influencing factors in typical regions of China. We suggest that the epidemic prevention and control strategies for the BYM should be developed in reference to those for the PRD, combined with the characteristics of the main factors influencing the regional epidemic to effectively strengthen the prevention and control measures for DF epidemics.</p>
