 </sup> . Moreover, to help some countries in Africa that have faced recent YF outbreaks, in June 2017 the WHO recommended the use of fractional doses of the YF vaccine, if there is a chance of running out of the full vaccine dose

 </sup> for the vaccination coverage of the population. However, the recommended fractional dose should be above 1,000 UI, and it should be used only to avoid the risk of YF spread, providing a one-year protection period

  <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> , 
  <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>
 </sup> . For this reason, the WHO has been stimulating new discoveries using viral genome sequencing to improve vaccines

  <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
 </sup> , and some studies have shown that polyclonal antibody therapies are very effective against many viruses
