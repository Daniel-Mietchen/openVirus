<p>Additionally, the quick identification of zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses can indirectly help to control and prevent yellow fever, since the preventive measures to control the vector of these diseases will be the same

 </sup> . Therefore, technological advances especially the molecular biology techniques, allow us to rapidly diagnose and differentiate diseases, and to be more assertive. To exemplify, there is a multiplex real-time PCR assay (RT-PCR) performed with primers and probes specifically designed to target and differentiate ZIKV, DENV, CHIKV and YFV

 </sup> . Another method that can be used is a single real-time RT-PCR assay, but in this case RNA will be reverse transcribed and cDNA will be the target nucleic acid of these viruses, and this technique can be very helpful to manage outbreaks and control the spread of arboviral diseases
