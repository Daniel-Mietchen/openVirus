<p>The YF laboratory diagnosis is attained through the detection of YF antigens by measuring IgM (which is not always representative of a recent infection) and IgG-specific antibody, when the patient has viremia

 </sup> . To confirm the presence of YFV, it is necessary to use immunohistochemical techniques to detect YF antigens in tissues or nucleic acids detection using amplification methods, such as Mac-ELISA/IFA, PCR, RT-PCT or other immunoassays such as flow cytometry, and microscopic analysis

 <sup>

 </sup> . More recent molecular techniques, such as the Point of Care (POC), can also be used to have more accurate laboratory diagnoses, using a portable equipment
 <sup>

 </sup> . Nevertheless, it cannot be used in developing countries due to the lack of investment in health care resources and laboratory equipment
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
 </sup> . POC has been used to detect ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV due its portability, specificity and sensitivity, using accessible samples such urine, saliva and tiny amounts of blood

 </sup> . POC can be a great monitoring and diagnostic tool for yellow fever as well, because it can help to attain a faster diagnosis, being very specific, with a relatively low cost.
