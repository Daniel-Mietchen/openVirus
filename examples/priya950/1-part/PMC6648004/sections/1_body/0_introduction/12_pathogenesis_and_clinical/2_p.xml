<p>In humans, the wild-type YFV infection is mainly viscerotropic and affects firstly the liver, before damaging other tissues, including the kidneys, spleen, lymph nodes and heart. After the incubation period, the first infection phase (1
 <sup>st</sup> stage) is characterized by a flu-like disease, during which fever is accompanied by chills, headache, nausea and myalgia. Then, a period of remission ensues, and most infected individuals recover. However, in the severe forms of YF, after a brief remission period (2
 <sup>nd</sup> stage) of no more than 48 h, some affected patients progress to the intoxication phase (3
 <sup>rd</sup> stage)
