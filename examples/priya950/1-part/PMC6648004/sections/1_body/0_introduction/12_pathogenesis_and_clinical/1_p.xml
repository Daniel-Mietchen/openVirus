<p>After the YFV-infected female mosquito bites, the virus infects dendritic cells within subcutaneous tissues and travels to the lymph nodes, where the virus replication occurs and the cellular immune response initiates. During this feeding process, approximately 1,000 to 100,000 viruses are inoculated into the hostâ€™s bloodstream, starting the replication stage (since virus cannot replicate outside a host). After this first RNA virus replication cycle, viruses are released into the bloodstream through the lymphatic channels (viremia) and they spread firstly to the regional lymph nodes. Then, they leave the lymph nodes and reach different organs, especially the liver, heart and kidneys.</p>
