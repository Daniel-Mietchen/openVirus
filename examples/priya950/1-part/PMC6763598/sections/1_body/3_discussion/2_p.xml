<p>The glycoprotein E is involved in binding of the viral particle to host cell receptors. In addition, such protein is also involved in membrane fusion. The E glycoprotein is arranged in three domains (DI, DII, and DIII). Domains I (DI) is central, surrounded by DII and DIII (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The hydrophobic fusion loop is located in DII. It is highly conserved in flaviviruses serocomplexes due to its important role in mediating membrane fusion (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The fusion loop has the same conformation in both protein forms trimer and dimer. In trimer, three amino acids are conserved in all flaviviruses (Trp 101, Leu 107, and Phe 108) and are exposed on molecular surface. Such amino acids have an important role in holding the fusion loop structure (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Replacement of the Trp101 by an alanine prevents membrane fusion (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). In addition, natural infection by DENV was hypothesized to generate anti-DENV antibodies with cross-neutralizing activity against the fusion loop (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). All of discontinuous epitopes found in our study are located in E protein and most of them present these three conserved amino acids. We hypothesize that B cell epitopes presented in our study remain highly conserved across flavivirus serocomplexes due to their location at fusion loop.
