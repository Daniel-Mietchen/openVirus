<p>From over than 2,000 epitopes retrieved from search carried out as described in materials and methods, 19 were selected after conservancy analyses. One of the epitopes is contained inside a larger epitope as a consensus, in the same location. Thus, 18 epitopes are shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Such epitopes are discontinuous. From these, seven epitopes were shown to be 100% conserved and were selected for structural analyses. All selected epitopes are located in flavivirus envelope glycoprotein, mainly in domains II and III, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Our results indicate that the seven neutralizing epitopes selected are highly conserved among flaviviruses and may be involved in cross-protection and restriction of virus circulation in some regions of the world.
