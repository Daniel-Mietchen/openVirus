<p>In this study we aimed to find both, immunological determinants and patterns of immune response possibly involved in flavivirus cross-protective immunity. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, we carried out a literature search of flavivirus epitopes involved in protective immunity. Such epitopes were analyzed with regard to their conservancy, population coverage and location in flavivirus polyprotein.
