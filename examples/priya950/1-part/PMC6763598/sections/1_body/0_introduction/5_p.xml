<p>The Americas, Africa, Middle East, South East Asia and Europe have at least one 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> serocomplex in circulation (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Many areas of the world present both, vector fauna and geographical conditions compatible with co-circulation, importing, emergence and epidemics of flaviviruses. The encounter with multiple flaviviruses in a lifetime is increasingly likely. However, flavivirus cross-protective immunity is not well understood. In this study we aimed to find both, immunological determinants, and patterns of immune response possibly involved in flavivirus cross-protective immunity. We searched B and T cells epitopes which were thoroughly shown to be involved in flavivirus immunological control. Such epitopes were analyzed regarding their conservation along with different flavivirus serocomplexes. The epitopes were also studied regarding their population coverage, considering HLA allele frequencies of different human populations. Finally, epitopes with highest conservancy and population coverage were studied regarding their position along flavivirus polyprotein. Results presented in this study indicate that epitopes capable of eliciting flavivirus cross-protective immunity to a wide range of human populations are concentrated in proteins E, NS3, and NS5. Such identification of both, immunological determinants and patterns of immune response involved in flavivirus cross-protective immunity should be considered in future vaccine development. In addition, cross-reactive epitopes presented in this work may be involved in dynamics of diseases caused by flaviviruses worldwide.
