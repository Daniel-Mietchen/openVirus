  <p>Structural analysis of highly conserved neutralizing epitopes in flaviviruses. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Model of DENV envelope glycoprotein arranged as a dimer [(
   <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), PDB number 1UZG]. Domain I is shown in red, domain II is shown in yellow, and domain III is shown in blue, and the fusion loop is shown in green. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Overview of locations of the neutralizing epitopes in E protein. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Approximate view of locations of epitopes which are targets for neutralizing antibodies. Epitopes shown to be located in domain II are: G78, W101, F108 (shown in green), W101, L107, G111 (shown in cyan), N103, G104, G111 (shown in deepteal cyan) and G100, W101, F108 (shown in lime green). Note that these epitopes are overlapping and that are they concentrated at the fusion loop and share W101 and G111. Domain III presents the epitopes: T303, T329, G383 (shown in light pink), K307, K310, L389 (shown in hot pink) and D378, R379, W381 (shown in violet purple).
