<p>To describe the transmission dynamics of LF infection in rodents, we used an SIR model (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 and more details in appendix C). The birth rate of rodents was defined by a periodic birth pulse function as suggested previously [

To adjust for the differences in climatological profile between the two countries, we shifted the dynamics fitted to the Tanzania data by a time lag equal to the difference between the starting times of the dry season in the two countries. Specifically, we defined this time lag by comparing historical rainfall averages for the time period 1901â€“2015 (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). We then implemented known measurements of the LF prevalence in rodents captured in Nigeria in the dry and rainy seasons separately, and we accounted for a non-zero probability of vertical transmission of the virus and its antibodies, as previously observed in rodents (see [
