<p>Our study encompasses the analysis of surveillance data on LF incidence in humans along with the transmission dynamics in the rodent reservoir. Using this modelling framework, we aimed to estimate the impact of environmental factors on the annual fluctuations in the risk of LF infection in humans. Similar methodological applications can be performed for other zoonotic diseases that involve well-identified wildlife animal hosts.</p>
