<p>We compared the epidemic patterns of 8 respiratory and 4 enteric viruses with the onset of HSP (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Since HSP occurs between 3 and 10 days after the preceding infection, the virus epidemics and the occurrence of HSP may appear at similar times in monthly comparisons. Among the 12 viruses, the epidemic patterns of influenza virus and rotavirus were statistically similar to those of HSP.
