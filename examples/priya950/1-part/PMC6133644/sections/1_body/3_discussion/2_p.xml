<p>The relationship between the incidence of HSP and predisposing diseases has been investigated in previous studies. Although various causes have been reported, it is known to occur mainly after respiratory infections such as those caused by streptococci, staphylococci, and mycoplasma.

 </sup> Nevertheless, the etiology of HSP often remains unknown. Almost 70% of the cases of HSP in children reported in Spain occurred in fall and winter.

 </sup> This higher incidence in the coldest months further supported an infectious trigger in the pathogenesis of the disease. Moreover, in this population study, upper respiratory infections were described as the potential precipitating event in more than 30% of the cases. By contrast, in the same region of NW Spain, adults in whom HSP occurred in summer were more susceptible to develop permanent renal involvement.

 </sup> However, studies on viral infections as the leading cause of HSP have limitations. HSP was reported in the 2009 influenza virus pandemic, and there have been reports that HSP incidences followed influenza vaccinations.

 </sup> However, most of these studies are case studies or cross-sectional studies from several institutions, and no large-scale studies have been conducted using the database of an entire country's healthcare system. In addition, different types of viral infections prevail in different regions, and their timings could vary. For this reason, our findings are important and meaningful because this is the first study to investigate the relationship between HSP and the preceding infectious diseases using the national health data from the HIRA and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention databases. First, through our investigation, we were able to identify the epidemiology of HSP and compare it with previous reports. Though HSP was known to affect boys predominantly, in our study, it was found to occur more in girls in South Korea.

 </sup> Previous studies have reported that HSP is commonly seen in winter or from late autumn to early spring, and we have confirmed a similar pattern.

 </sup> We found that it predominantly occurred in spring and specifically in March, and less in the summer particularly in August, although the number of cases reported in August was never &lt;5.7% of that reported for the whole year.
