<p>Data were collected from January 2012 to December 2016, and all patients under 18 years of age with a history of HSP screening during the above period were reviewed. In the HIRA data, patients were identified by a personal identification number as their personal information was not known. It is possible that for some patients in the 2012 records, it was not their initial diagnosis, but they had been previously diagnosed and were being treated again. For that reason, data from 2012 were not included in the study and were used only as a means of identifying previously treated patients, in 2013. Therefore, the study included all patients &lt;18 years of age who were diagnosed with HSP from January 2013 to December 2016 in South Korea.

Data selection and mining were conducted using SAS (version 9.2).</p>
