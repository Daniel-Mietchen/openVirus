<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 18.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Differences based on seasons and age groups in the newly diagnosed HSP patients were analyzed using the chi-squared test, and 
 <italic>P</italic> values &lt; .05 were considered statistically significant. To investigate the prevalence of each virus, its trends and seasonality were confirmed using the R program. In general, HSP is known to occur 3 to 10 days after a preceding infection. Usually, a virus that causes an infectious disease is detected a few days after the disease has developed. Therefore, when comparing the time of positive detection of the virus and the time of HSP diagnosis, it is important to use weekly and monthly data. In the correlation analysis, it was confirmed that the 
 <italic>P</italic> value was &lt;0.05 and the correlation coefficient was &gt;0.5. We used the decomposition of additive time series analysis and correlation analysis to compare the incidence of HSP and the prevalence of each virus.
