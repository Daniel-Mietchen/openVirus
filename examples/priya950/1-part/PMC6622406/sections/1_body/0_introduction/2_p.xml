<p>The HIV-1 epidemic in Hispaniola is dominated by subtype B (

 <sub>CAR</sub>”), although the worldwide disseminated “B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub>” lineage also circulates (

Previous evolutionary analyses pointed that subtype B probably entered in the Americas through Haiti around the mid-1960s and then moved to other countries (

This study, however, may have traced the age of the Haitian subtype B ancestor rather than of the Dominican one, given that it assumed that all subtype B infections in the Dominican Republic resulted from a single introduction and that the hypothesis of multiple independent viral introductions from Haiti was not formally tested.
