<p>A closer inspection of the phylogenetic relationship among B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences confirm that sequences from Haiti and the Dominican Republic were highly intermixed with each other and are usually basal to sequences from other Caribbean islands (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Most sequences from other well-sampled islands like Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, by contrast, branched in country-specific subclades that were nested within the Hispaniola B
 <sub>CAR</sub> diversity. Very few sequences from Hispaniola (&lt;1%) branched within Trinidadian and Jamaican clusters, confirming that most B
 <sub>CAR</sub> infections in Hispaniola resulted from internal viral dissemination and not from re-introductions of viral strains from other Caribbean islands. To investigate the phylogeographic structure of the HIV-1 epidemic within Hispaniola, B
 <sub>CAR</sub>
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Haiti here identified (
 <italic>n</italic> = 91) were combined with Haitian (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12) and Dominican (
 <italic>n</italic> = 123) B
 <sub>CAR</sub>
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences identified in a previous study (
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Cabello et al., 2014</xref>) and analyzed using BaTS. Analyses of population subdivision rejected the null hypothesis of panmixis (i.e., complete intermixing of sequences from Haiti and the Dominican Republic) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>), demonstrating that despite frequent viral intermixing between both countries, the geographic subdivision of the HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences from Hispaniola was greater than expected by chance.
