<p>The same dataset of B
 <sub>CAR</sub>
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Haiti (
 <italic>n</italic> = 103) and the Dominican Republic (
 <italic>n</italic> = 123) was then subjected to Bayesian phylogeographic analyses. Reconstruction of the spatiotemporal dissemination dynamic traced the T
 <sub>MRCA</sub> for the HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> epidemic in Hispaniola at 1967 (95% HPD: 1961â€“1972), but failed to uncover its precise epicenter (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). After combining six independent Bayesian MCMC runs, the root location of the HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> ancestor in Hispaniola was traced with equal probability [posterior state probability (PSP) = 0.50] to Haiti and to the Dominican Republic. The difficulty to trace the location of the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> root into a single country was also evidenced when the results obtained from independent Bayesian MCMC runs were visualized separately (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Quantification of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> flux between countries using Markov jump counts support a mean of 18 viral migrations from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and 9 viral migration events from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. These viral migrations started in the early 1970s and were homogenously distributed between the mid-1970s and the mid-2000s (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The Bayesian phylogeographic analysis also revealed 20 country-specific (14 Dominican and 6 Haitian) B
 <sub>CAR</sub> monophyletic subclades with relative high node support [posterior probability (PP) &gt; 0.70] (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The Dominican B
 <sub>CAR</sub> subclades mostly arose between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>) and together comprised 55% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 68) of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences from the country.
