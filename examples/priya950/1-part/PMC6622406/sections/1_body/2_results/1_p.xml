<p>All new HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Haiti obtained here (
 <italic>n</italic> = 127) were confirmed as non-recombinant subtype B by ML phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) and RDP recombination analysis (data not shown). The HIV-1 subtype B Haitian sequences were combined with viral strains representative of the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> diversity in different Caribbean islands (
 <italic>n</italic> = 200) and of the B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> diversity in the US and France (
 <italic>n</italic> = 300) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) as previously characterized (
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Cabello et al., 2014</xref>). The ML phylogenetic analysis revealed that most subtype B Haitian sequences (
 <italic>n</italic> = 91, 72%) were intermixed among basal non-pandemic B
 <sub>CAR</sub> lineages, whereas the remaining ones (
 <italic>n</italic> = 36, 28%) branched within the well-supported (aLRT = 0.89) B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> clade (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Analysis of the epidemiological characteristics of Haitian subjects showed that both B
 <sub>CAR</sub> and B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> viral lineages circulated among males and females of different age groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). No significant differences were observed in the frequency of subtype B lineages according to gender (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.82) or age group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.45), although subjects infected with B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains had a relative younger mean age (36.0 years) as compared with those infected with the B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> clade (40.1 years) (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03).
