<p>This study confirms that the HIV-1 subtype B epidemic in Haiti is mostly driven by dissemination of early divergent non-pandemic B
 <sub>CAR</sub> lineages (

 <sub>CAR</sub> lineages among HIV-1 subtype B infections in Haiti (72%) closely matches that estimated in the neighboring Dominican Republic (74%) (

 <sub>CAR</sub>-infected individuals in the Americas. Our results reveal a high degree of phylogenetic intermixing of the HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences from Haiti and the Dominican Republic, consistent with the historical intense cross-border population mobility (

 <sub>CAR</sub> infections in the Dominican Republic probably occurred within local transmission networks.
