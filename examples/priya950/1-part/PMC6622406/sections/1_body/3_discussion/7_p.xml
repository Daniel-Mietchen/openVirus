<p>In summary, this study highlights that the HIV-1 epidemic in Haiti is mainly driven by dissemination of early divergent non-pandemic B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains. Our findings revealed that the HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> epidemics in Haiti and the Dominican Republic are highly connected by intensive bidirectional viral dispersal since the early 1970s and that local B
 <sub>CAR</sub> transmission was already established in both countries when the first AIDS cases were officially recognized. Despite the use of a geographically balanced B
 <sub>CAR</sub> dataset, probabilistic Bayesian phylogeographic models cannot uncover the root of the subtype B epidemic in Hispaniola by using only genetic sequence information. Our findings support that both national and bi-national coordinated prevention measures are necessary to further control the HIV-1 dissemination in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
