<p>While the BSKL model supports a stabilization of the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> epidemic in Hispaniola from the early 1990s onwards, the BSKG reconstruction supports a sustained expansion until the late 1990s and a subsequent decline until the most recent coalescent event. The pattern here recovered by the BSKG model is consistent with the reported decline in HIV incidence in Haiti and the Dominican Republic since the late 1990s (
