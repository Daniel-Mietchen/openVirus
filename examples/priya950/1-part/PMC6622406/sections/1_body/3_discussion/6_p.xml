<p>A drawback to consider in our study is the relative small size of our sample. According to the UNAIDS, the number of people living with HIV was estimated at around 150,000 in Haiti and 67,000 in the Dominican Republic in 2017. Assuming that 70â€“75% of those infections probably correspond to B
 <sub>CAR</sub> viruses, a very small fraction (&lt;1%) of B
 <sub>CAR</sub>-infected people living in those countries was included in our study. This low sampling density does not provide adequate power to assess HIV-1 clustering in generalized epidemics and could produce misleading results (
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Novitsky et al., 2014</xref>). The second limitation of our study is the lack of meta-data (such as city of origin, age, sex, or potential risk behavior) for most of the HIV-infected individuals included in our analysis, avoiding the identification of trends between individuals linked within the same local cluster. Finally, it is unclear whether our sample truly represents the whole diversity of HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> in Haiti because most Haitian individuals here analyzed were from the capital city (Port-au-Prince).
