  <p>Spatiotemporal dissemination of HIV-1 B
   <sub>CAR</sub> lineages in Hispaniola. Time-scaled Bayesian MCC tree of HIV-1 B
   <sub>CAR</sub>
   <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Haiti (
   <italic>n</italic> = 103) and the Dominican Republic (
   <italic>n</italic> = 123) combined with subtype D reference sequences from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 10). Branches are colored according to the most probable location state of their descendent nodes as indicated in the legend on the left. Shaded boxes highlight the position of B
   <sub>CAR</sub> clades only composed by sequences from Haiti or the Dominican Republic (identified by numbers) and that displayed both high clade (PP ≥ 0.70) and location state (PSP ≥ 0.90) node supports. Circles at internal nodes are colored according to the corresponding PP node support as indicated in the legend on the left. Branch lengths are depicted in units of time (years). The tree was rooted under the assumption of a relaxed molecular clock.
