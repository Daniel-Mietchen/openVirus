<p>Nextstrain tracks and reconstructs mutations across the tree and displays this information as a bar chart of entropy at each position in the genome, as well as showing the mutations inferred to occur on each branch by hovering over the tree. Selecting a position in the genome with non-zero entropy reveals the distribution of the segregating variant in the phylogeny and on the map. This allows interrogation of genetic change which may be adaptive or underlying a change in disease dynamics.</p>
