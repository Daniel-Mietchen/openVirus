<p>Analysis of such outbreaks relies on public sharing of data, and Nextstrain has the ability to automatically update as new sequences from a range of public databases and repositories appear. Scientists are justifiably hesitant to cede control of their data, and we try to address these concerns by preventing access to the raw genome sequences, and by clearly indicating the source of each sequence. Derived data, such as phylogenetic trees, metadata and screenshots are available, and one can append private metadata via CSV files. We believe this strikes a compromise between keeping certain data private and allowing the dissemination of results important to the wider scientific community, thereby encouraging collaboration between scientists. Genomic epidemiology has the potential to inform the public, health organisations and scientists alike, a potential realized by sharing of data in real-time rather than retrospectively (
