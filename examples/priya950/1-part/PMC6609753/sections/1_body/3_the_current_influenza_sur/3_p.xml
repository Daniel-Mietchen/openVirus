 <bold>Laboratory sentinel surveillance.</bold> KINRESS is operated at 52 sites (as of July 2018) among the clinics participating in the clinical sentinel surveillance. The sites participating in KINRESS collect respiratory specimens from patients with ILI and send them to the regional Research Institutes of Public Health and Environment. The institutes conduct gene detection tests and send the results and residual samples to the KCDC. The KCDC conducts virus identification and reexamination of unidentified specimens. Based on these results, the circulating influenza viruses in Korea are identified, and the characteristics of the viruses are revealed, including resistance to antiviral agents and matched with the vaccine strain.
