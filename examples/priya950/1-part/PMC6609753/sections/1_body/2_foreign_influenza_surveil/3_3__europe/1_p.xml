<p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) coordinates the Influenza Surveillance Network (EISN) [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The aim of the EISN is to contribute to reducing the influenza burden in Europe. The EISN originated in the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) by the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research. The EISS started in 1996 and was Europe's initial surveillance network. Its name was changed to EISN in September 2008 and is currently operated by the ECDC. The EISN has 50 member states in Europe. Each member state has a separate influenza surveillance system and case definition for the surveillance. The form of surveillance also varies depending on the region. Each member state reports epidemiologic and virologic data to The European Surveillance System, which is hosted by the ECDC. Surveillance is mainly based on nationally organized sentinel networks of primary care physicians, which cover at least 1â€“5% of the population of each country. Virologic surveillance activities are coordinated through the European Reference Laboratory Network for Human Influenza, a sub-network of the EISN. For the surveillance of severe influenza, 16 member states conduct sentinel surveillance for hospitalized cases with SARI, and 13 member states report laboratory-confirmed influenza-positive cases from intensive care units.
