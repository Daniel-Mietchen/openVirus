<p>An influenza surveillance system is useful for identifying influenza epidemics, the nature of the virus, and the burden of disease, as well as determining the policies aimed at influenza epidemic control, vaccine selection, and the development of guidelines for the use of antiviral drugs. An influenza surveillance system can also be used to monitor influenza pandemics and new respiratory infectious diseases. Korea currently operates a national influenza surveillance system based on the clinical sentinel surveillance system, laboratory sentinel surveillance system, and hospitalization and mortality surveillance system. However, there is a need for a better national surveillance system due to the increased demand for various pieces of information related to influenza. This article reviews the influenza surveillance system characteristics, foreign surveillance systems, including those of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States (US), and the influenza surveillance system of Korea. It further discusses the future direction of the national influenza surveillance system of Korea.</p>
