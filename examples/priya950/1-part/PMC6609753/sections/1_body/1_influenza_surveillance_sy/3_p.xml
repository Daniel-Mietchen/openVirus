<p>Clinical sentinel surveillance systems are classified into the outpatient department (OPD)-based surveillance and hospitalization-based surveillance systems. OPD-based surveillance systems are used to determine the occurrence of influenza epidemics by monitoring the ratio of the number of ILI patients relative to all outpatients. The sites assessed during OPD-based surveillance should be selected based on their geographical distribution and population characteristics among OPD clinics that directly treat influenza patients. The selected sites report the information of patients with ILI predefined on a daily or weekly basis via internet, telephone or fax. The collected data are interpreted taking into consideration the characteristics of the participating sites, virologic surveillance data, geographical and demographic characteristics, and influenza vaccination rate. The hospitalization-based surveillance system contributes to the understanding of the severity and burden of influenza by monitoring cases of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) care, and mortality. Influenza is more likely to cause complications or severe progression than other respiratory viruses. The main anticipated effect of influenza vaccination is to reduce the burden of influenza. Therefore, a hospitalization-based surveillance system is essential to determine the appropriateness and evaluate the effectiveness of policies for influenza control. Data collected through both surveillance systems can be used to assess influenza vaccine effectiveness. However, a procedure for increasing the accuracy of influenza vaccination history is required to evaluate the influenza vaccine effectiveness accurately. In addition, a sufficient number of patients should be included in the surveillance to assess the vaccine effect by virus type/subtypes and age groups.</p>
