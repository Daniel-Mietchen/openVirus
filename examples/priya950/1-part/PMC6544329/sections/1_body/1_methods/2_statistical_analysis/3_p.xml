<p>Here, 
 <italic>S</italic> is a smoothing operator. Following established methods, the number of monthly imported CHIKV cases were converted into a normal distribution by a logarithmic transformation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The 5% significance level was determined using Monte Carlo methods (1000 Monte Carlo randomizations). Wavelet analysis was conducted using the package “biwavelet” in R [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The squared wavelet coherence shows as a “heat map”. The phase (lead-lag) relationships between 
 <italic>x</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) and 
 <italic>y</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) are presented by arrows pointing in the heat map. There is a positive (negative) relationship between 
 <italic>x</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) and 
 <italic>y</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) when the arrows point to right (left). The arrows pointing up (down) mean that 
 <italic>x</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) lags (leads) 
 <italic>y</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) by π/2.
