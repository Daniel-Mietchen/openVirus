<p>In general, SOI fluctuates monthly, while the development of an El Niño or a La Niña event requires negative or positive SOI values for a period of several months [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Before starting the wavelet analysis, we examined the correlations between monthly imported CHIKV cases and 2–6 month lagged moving averages of SOI, respectively. We performed linear regression models using SPSS software to examine the relationships between monthly imported CHIKV cases and 2–6 month lagged moving average. The 6-month lagged moving average SOI displayed the highest R
 <sup>2</sup> value for the linear regression model and the highest value of correlation coefficient. Thus, the 6-month lagged moving average SOI was used in the wavelet coherence analysis.
