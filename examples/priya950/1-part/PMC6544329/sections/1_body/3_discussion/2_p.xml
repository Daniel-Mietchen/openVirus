<p>There were also the peaks in overseas importation from specific countries that coincided with large epidemics observed in those regions. For example, there were massive CHIKV outbreaks in the Americas in 2014 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These outbreaks coincided with CHIKV importation into Australia in 2014 from Barbados, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Grenada, Jamaica, United States of America and Venezuela. A major CHIKV outbreak was reported in Papua New Guinea in 2013 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which resulted in the largest number of imported CHIKV cases into Australia during the period of 2013â€“2017. Samoa and Tonga experienced large CHIKV outbreaks in 2014 which corresponded to the high numbers of imported CHIKV cases into Australia in 2014 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], which also led to 54.39% of CHIKV cases into Australia originating in India that year. Bangladesh experienced a significant chikungunya outbreak in 2017 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], with Australia observing the largest number of imported CHIKV cases in 2017 being from Bangladesh. Moreover, it is notable that there was an increase in the frequency and number of imported CHIKV cases into Australia over the study period, suggesting that the potential risk of autochthonous outbreak will increase if there is sufficient vector mosquito density under suitable weather conditions, in regions with competent vectors in Australia.
