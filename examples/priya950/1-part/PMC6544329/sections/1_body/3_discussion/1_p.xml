<p>An increased number of countries of acquisition for CHIKV cases imported into Australia was observed during the study period, supporting previous reports of global expansion of CHIKV endemicity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The Pacific region and Southeast/South/Central Asia were the most frequent sources of imported CHIKV cases in Australia, particularly Indonesia and India. From 2014, the geographic range of countries of acquisition expanded to include United States of America, South America, Caribbean Islands, South Africa, and Eastern/Western Africa. Although the number of international arrivals displayed a stable linear increasing trend over the study period, the monthly imported CHIKV cases did not follow the same trend and displayed some instability. It is likely that the trend of monthly imported CHIKV cases reflects the most recent dynamics of CHIKV epidemics in the most frequent countries of acquisition and the number of passenger movements from large epidemic countries.
