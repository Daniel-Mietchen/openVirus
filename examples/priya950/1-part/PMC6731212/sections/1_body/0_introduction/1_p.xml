<p id="Par2">Influenza, an acute viral infectious disease that primarily affects the upper respiratory tract, is caused by the influenza virus, which belongs to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. There are three types of influenza viruses, which commonly infect humans: A, B and C. The first two are responsible for annual seasonal epidemics. Type A influenza viruses are divided into subtypes depending on the composition of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), two proteins on the virus surface. There are several subtypes of influenza A but, currently, the viruses that circulate and affect humans are subtypes A (H3N2) and A (H1N1). Subtype A (H1N1) pdm09 was first identified in 2009, in the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, and since then has circulated along with other seasonal viruses in the post-pandemic period

 </sup>. Influenza produces annual epidemics that affect between 5 and 15% of the world population. It is estimated that between 3 and 5 million people have serious influenza with complications and hospital admission annually and approximately 250,000–500,000 people die annually due to influenza

 </sup>. Influenza symptoms vary widely from mild to lower respiratory tract infection such as bronchitis or complicated pneumonia, leading to respiratory and multiorgan failure and death. Influenza may affect people of any age, but complications and hospitalizations are more frequent in childhood, especially in children aged &lt;5 years, people with chronic disease and people aged ≥65 years
