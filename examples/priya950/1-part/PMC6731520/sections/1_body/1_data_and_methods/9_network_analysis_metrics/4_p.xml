<p id="par0125">To quantify outbreak risk due to network structure, we define an additional metric, the “expected outward reach” or EOR. For a given node, the term “reach” (
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2009</xref>), is defined to be the number of nodes that can be reached by following network paths emanating from this node and including the node itself (the size of the out component). For nodes in the LSCC, the reach is equal to the size of LSCC + out. The EOR is then the expected value of this quantity for nodes selected uniformly at random. This is the expected maximum number nodes infected, given a uniformly seeded infection event and so gives a metric for the worst case epidemic scenario given the network structure.
