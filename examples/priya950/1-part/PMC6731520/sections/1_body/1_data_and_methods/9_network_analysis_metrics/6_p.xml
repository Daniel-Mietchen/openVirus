<p id="par0150">The first two are locally determined measures and so are advantageous because they can be determined without full knowledge of the network structure. Betweenness is found to be the most effective out of many measures investigated. The impact of removing the nodes according to each criterion is calculated by sequentially removing the node from the transport network layer that has the greatest centrality and then recalculating the full network EOR. The centrality measures for the reduced network are then determined to identify the relevant node for the next iteration. Fifty nodes are removed in this way.</p>
