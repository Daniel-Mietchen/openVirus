 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These official records are held by the Fish Health Inspectorate at MSS, and are dated and recorded at both source and destination farms, providing overlap and confirmation opportunities. Scottish paper records covering 2009–2011 were transferred to an electronic database. This was done according to the validation process used in previous network analysis of fish movement data in Scotland (

 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Munro and Gregory, 2009</xref>), with only confirmed movements (i.e. only those movements recorded at both source and destination sites) being entered into the database. The 2009–2011 dataset was the most complete data available at the time. Live fish movements that cross the English-Scottish border were also included in this study. Both agencies recorded movements in both directions across the border. Here, Scottish data was the primary source of information on cross-border connections, since MSS records include the specific Cefas site involved. Cross-border links were cross-checked with Cefas records where possible and also cover the period 2009–2011.
