<p id="par0060">We define our network nodes as single-group; if both salmon and trout nodes are in close proximity and are jointly managed, they form a multi-group site. We considered both fish farms and recreational fisheries. For the purposes of this analysis, sites in England and Wales were categorised as fish farms if they are authorised for operation by Cefas and subject to surveillance. In Scotland, fish farm sites were categorised by consultation with MSS. To ensure only active sites were included in the network, non-farm sites (categorised as “other”) were only included in the analysis if they were a source or target of a live fish movement. Sites that registered only live fish movements peripheral to the industry, such as restocking-only facilities, were excluded.</p>
