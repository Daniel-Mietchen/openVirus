<p id="par0200">Analysis of the onward network links reveals that the 115 nodes in England and Wales with cross border connections from Scotland can reach a further 2057 nodes in England and Wales via transport links. A total of 87% of the Cefas network nodes are therefore reachable from Scotland. In the opposite direction, the 50 Scottish nodes with connections from England and Wales can reach a further 630 nodes; or a total of 72% of the MSS network is reachable from England and Wales via transport links. Including all link type layers (see below) in the onward network increases these figures to 95% of Cefas nodes and 87% of MSS nodes.</p>
