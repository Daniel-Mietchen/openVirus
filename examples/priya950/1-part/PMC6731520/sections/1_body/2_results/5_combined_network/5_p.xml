<p id="par0220">The LSCC increases significantly when we combine the network layers. 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> illustrates different layer permutations. In particular, it is clear that the combination of transport and local link layers yields a major change in the size of the LSCC, well beyond the combined individual LSCCs of the salmon and trout networks. Only relatively minor increments to the LSCC are provided by adding river and marine layers. It is the combined effect of all of these potential routes of transmission, but particularly of transport and local routes, that yields an epidemiological system that has a significant probability of propagating large outbreaks. Considering the transport network layer alone, 91% of nodes in the LSCC are farms (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This percentage decreases as other layers are added, reflecting the increasing importance of fisheries, reducing to 55% for all layers.
