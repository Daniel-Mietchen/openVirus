 <caption>
  <p>The multi-layer network of the GB salmonid aquaculture industry for salmon (top), and trout (bottom). Link layers are colored by type: blue = river, local = green, transport = black and marine = orange. Nodes are colored by their dominant link type. Node color scales to white depending on proportion of connections for which node is the source (i.e. white = source, full color = sink). Links have the colour of the source node. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).</p>
