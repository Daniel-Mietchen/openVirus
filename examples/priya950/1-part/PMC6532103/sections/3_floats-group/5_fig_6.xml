  <p>H5N1 virus without an MBCS replicates less efficiently in the absence of trypsin. (A) Replication kinetics of HPAI H5N1
   <sup>WT</sup> and H5N1
   <sup>ΔMBCS</sup> viruses in SK-N-SH, U87-MG, and MDCK cells (MOI of 0.1) in the presence or absence of trypsin. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test against “H5N1WT + trypsin.” (B) Percentages of infection in SK-N-SH, U87-MG, and MDCK cells were determined by FACS at 8 hpi with HPAI H5N1
   <sup>WT</sup> and H5N1
   <sup>ΔMBCS</sup> viruses (MOI of 3). Statistical analysis was performed using the two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison test. (C) Percentages of infection in SK-N-SH, U87-MG, and MDCK cells were determined by FACS at 8 and 24 hpi with HPAI H5N1
   <sup>WT</sup> and H5N1
   <sup>ΔMBCS</sup> viruses at an MOI of 0.1 in the absence of trypsin. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison test (8 versus 24 hpi). All data are presented as means ± SDs from at least three independent experiments. *,
