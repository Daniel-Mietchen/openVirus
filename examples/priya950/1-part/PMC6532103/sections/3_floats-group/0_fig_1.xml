  <p>In the presence of trypsin, HPAI H5N1 virus replicates most efficiently in SK-N-SH, U87-MG, pmCortex, and MDCK cells. (A to D) Growth kinetics of pH1N1, H3N2, HPAI H5N1, and WSN viruses in SK-N-SH, U87-MG, pmCortex, and MDCK cells (MOI of 0.1) in the presence of trypsin. Data are presented as means ± SDs from at least three independent experiments.
