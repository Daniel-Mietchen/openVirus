<p>In order to infect, replicate in, and spread throughout the CNS, influenza viruses first have to be able to enter the CNS. Entry of influenza viruses into the CNS can occur via, for example, the olfactory (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), trigeminal (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), vagus (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and sympathetic (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) nerves and possibly other cranial nerves. The primary targets of influenza viruses are, however, epithelial cells of the respiratory tract (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), which differ from cells of the CNS. Influenza virus infection starts with attachment of the virus to sialic acids (SA) present on host cells (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Human and avian influenza viruses attach preferentially to α-2,6- and α-2,3-linked SA, respectively, present in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of humans, respectively (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In cells of the CNS, little is known about SA distribution on the different cells at different anatomical locations. One comparative study using lectin immunohistochemistry suggested that in humans, both α-2,6 and α-2,3 SA are present on neurons and glial cells in many different regions, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In the mouse brain, however, SA distribution is less widespread, and regions with and without detectable SA are infected with influenza viruses (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In another study, it was found that in human cortex tissue, some neurons only express α-2,3 SA, oligodendrocytes mainly express α-2,6 SA, while astrocytes appear to express both receptors (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Moreover, both α-2,3 and α-2,6 SA receptors have been found to be present on human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y and human glioblastoma T98G cell lines (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Given these differential results as well as the fact that SA usage depends on more than α-2,3 and α-2,6 SA linkage, e.g., α-2,8 SA linkage (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) or even SA-independent entry of the virus (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), more studies should reveal which viruses are able to attach to cells in the CNS.
