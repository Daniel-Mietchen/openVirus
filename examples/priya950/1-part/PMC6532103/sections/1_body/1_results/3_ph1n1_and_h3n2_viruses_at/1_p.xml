<p>To determine whether there were differences in attachment between the viruses and whether this was associated with the infection percentages, we performed a virus attachment assay. The attachment efficiency was scored as follows: inefficient attachment (0% to 5%), low attachment (6% to 25%), intermediate attachment (26% to 75%), and efficient attachment (&gt;76%). HPAI H5N1 virus attached efficiently (&gt;90%) to all cell lines investigated (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">D</xref>). Seasonal H3N2 virus attached with low efficiency to SK-N-SH (12%) and intermediate efficiency to MDCK (39%) cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">D</xref>). Neither pH1N1 nor H3N2 virus attached to U87-MG cells (&lt;2%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">C</xref>). Overall, these results show that pH1N1 and H3N2 viruses attach less efficiently to SK-N-SH and U87-MG cells than H5N1 and WSN viruses.
