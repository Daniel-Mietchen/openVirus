<p>To test whether efficient replication is dependent on the presence of trypsin, we determined the replication kinetics in the absence of trypsin. Replication of HPAI H5N1 and WSN viruses was not affected by the absence of trypsin (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). We found that neither SK-N-SH nor U87-MG cells expressed HAT, TMPRSS2, nor TMPRSS4 mRNA, whereas these transcripts were present in human nasal cell (HN) cultures and human bronchial/tracheal epithelial (HBTE) cultures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). These results show that HPAI H5N1 and WSN viruses replicate independently of trypsin and that pH1N1 and H3N2 viruses are dependent on trypsin for replication in SK-N-SH cells.
