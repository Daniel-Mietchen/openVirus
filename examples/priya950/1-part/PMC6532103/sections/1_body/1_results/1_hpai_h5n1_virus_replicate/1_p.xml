<p>The replication kinetics of pH1N1, H3N2, HPAI H5N1, and WSN viruses were determined in SK-N-SH, U87-MG, pmCortex, and MDCK cells in the presence of trypsin. All viruses replicated efficiently in MDCK cells, where HPAI H5N1 virus and H3N2 virus replicated to higher titers than pH1N1 virus and WSN virus (

 <sub>10</sub> 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID
 <sub>50</sub>]/ml) than all other viruses (
