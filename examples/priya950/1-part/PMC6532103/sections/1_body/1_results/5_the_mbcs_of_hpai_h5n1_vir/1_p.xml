<p>To determine whether efficient replication of HPAI H5N1 virus in cell culture solely depends on the presence of the MBCS, we generated an H5N1 virus without the MBCS. The replication kinetics of the HPAI H5N1
 <sup>WT</sup> (wild-type) virus was not affected by the presence or absence of trypsin in all cell lines

 <sup>ΔMBCS</sup> virus, without trypsin, replicated to a lower titer on each cell line investigated. This phenotype was restored by the addition of trypsin to the culture medium, allowing the virus to replicate to wild-type levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The reduced replication efficiency of H5N1
 <sup>ΔMBCS</sup> virus was not explained by the ability of the virus to infect cells, since this was not affected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). In order to determine if there were multiple rounds of infection and that virus detected in the supernatant was not solely the result of primary infected cells, we investigated the percentage of infection at 8 and 24 hpi with an MOI of 0.1, without trypsin, measured by flow cytometry. We found that HPAI H5N1
 <sup>WT</sup> virus efficiently replicated in MDCK, SK-N-SH, and U87-MG cells as indicated by the increase of infection percentages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). In contrast, a significant increase for H5N1
 <sup>ΔMBCS</sup> virus only was observed in MDCK and U87-MG cells. In SK-N-SH cells, no increased infection percentage was observed. These results reveal that the MBCS is important but not solely responsible for efficient replication in MDCK and U87-MG cells in the absence of trypsin.
