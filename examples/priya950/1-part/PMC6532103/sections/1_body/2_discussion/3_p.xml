<p>Efficient replication of influenza viruses in cells of the CNS seems to depend in part on the presence of an MBCS or alternative HA cleaving mechanisms. Studies in ferrets, mice, macaques, and chickens show that introduction or removal of an MBCS has different outcomes based on the virus backbone and host species (

 <italic>In vitro</italic>, in the absence of trypsin, only HPAI H5N1 and WSN viruses were able to replicate, indicating that pH1N1 and H3N2 viruses are not able to circumvent the need for trypsin-like protease for HA cleavage. Removal of the MBCS from HPAI H5N1 virus resulted in attenuated replication in SK-N-SH and U87-MG cells in the absence of trypsin but not in pmCortex cells. Viruses without an MBCS that are associated with replication in cells of the CNS 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, such as the 1918 H1N1 and WSN viruses, have an alternative HA cleavage mechanism (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) by using the serine-protease plasmin, which is present in many organ systems besides the respiratory tract (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). The 1918 H1N1 virus grows trypsin independent and neuraminidase dependent in MDCK cells and polarized Calu-3 cells but not in Huh-7 cells (

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Our observation that neither HAT, TMPRSS2, nor TMPRSS4 is found in SK-N-SH and U87-MG cells supports the hypothesis that for efficient replication in cells of the CNS, influenza viruses require alternative HA cleavage, as shown for the HPAI H5N1, WSN, and 1918 H1N1 viruses. However, it must be noted that there is limited knowledge on the expression and accessibility of proteases in tissues other than the respiratory tract.
