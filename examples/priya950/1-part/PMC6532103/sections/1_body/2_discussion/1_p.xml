<p>Here we show that HPAI H5N1 virus replicates more efficiently in human and mouse neuronal cells than seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Both the ability to attach efficiently and the presence of an MBCS of HPAI H5N1 virus contributed to efficient replication in cells of the CNS, indicative that these are viral factors that contribute to the neurotropic potential of influenza viruses. This fits with the facts that HPAI H5N1 virus is more frequently associated with CNS disease in humans than seasonal and pandemic viruses (
