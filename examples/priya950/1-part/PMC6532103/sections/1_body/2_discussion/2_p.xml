<p>The ability of HPAI H5N1 and WSN viruses to replicate efficiently in cells of the CNS seems to be associated with the ability to attach to and infect host cells efficiently. Especially, HPAI H5N1 virus which replicated efficiently in SK-N-SH and U87-MG cells, attached to high percentages of cells with high intensity, and infected these cells efficiently. WSN virus attached to and infected high percentages of neuronal cells, which resulted in multiple rounds of infection in all cells, although to lower titers on SK-N-SH and U87-MG cells than observed for HPAI H5N1 virus. The latter could be due to the fact that WSN virus is extensively passaged in suckling mouse brains, thereby adapting to mouse neuronal cells and not human neuronal cells. Seasonal H3N2 viruses replicated in SK-N-SH cells, even in the absence of efficient attachment or infection. Whether this is due to low-affinity binding of H3N2 virus, which cannot be detected by our assays, is unknown, but it does suggest that efficient attachment, as observed for H5N1 and WSN viruses on neuronal cells, is not the only viral factor involved in replication of influenza viruses in cells of the CNS. The lack of replication of H3N2 and pH1N1 viruses in U87-MG cells could be explained by both inefficient attachment and infection.</p>
