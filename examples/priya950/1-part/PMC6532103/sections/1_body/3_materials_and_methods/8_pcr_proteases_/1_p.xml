<p>Since MDCK cells are of canine origin, we have included primary human nasal (HN) cells (MucilAir, pool of 14 donors; Epithelix, Geneva, Switzerland), and primary human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells (HBTE) (catalog number CC-2540, lot 97366, donor 97366: male, Caucasian, 57 years, healthy; Lonza) as control cell types for the expression of human HAT, human TMPRSS2, and human TMPRSS4. Total RNA was isolated from SK-N-SH, U87-MG, HN, and HBTE cells using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA synthesis was performed using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript IV (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For detection of HAT-, TMPRSS2-, and TMPRSS4-specific mRNAs, primers were used from Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al. (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). The GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) mRNA was detected using primers GAPDH-FW (5′-TGA ACG GGA AGC TCA CTG G-3′) and GAPDH-RV (5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′) as a control for sample quality. PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with SYBR Safe (Thermo Fisher) and imaged using a ChemiDoc MP imaging system and ImageLab 5.1 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). To confirm the specificity of the primers, PCR products were extracted from the gel and sequenced using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and a 3130XL genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems), according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
