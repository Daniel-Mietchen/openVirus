<p>After 8 hpi (with an MOI of 3) or after 8 and 24 hpi (with an MOI of 0.1), in the absence of trypsin, cells were collected, fixed, and permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated with 2% normal goat serum (NGS; Dako, Denmark) in PBS for 10 min on ice. Next, influenza A virus was detected using a monoclonal antibody against influenza A virus nucleoprotein (clone HB-65, 1 μg/ml; ATCC) or mouse IgG2a isotype control (MAB003, 1 μg/ml; Dako) in BD Perm/Wash containing 2% NGS and incubated for 1 h on ice and in the dark. Cells were washed twice and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG2a conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (8 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc., the Netherlands) for 1 h in the dark and on ice. After incubation, cells were washed twice and resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer. Cells were measured and data collected using a BD FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences, USA). Data were analyzed using FlowJo 10 software (Ashland, OR, USA). All experiments were performed three times (biological replicates), and each experiment included duplicate (technical replicate) measurements from which the average was calculated and used for further analysis.</p>
