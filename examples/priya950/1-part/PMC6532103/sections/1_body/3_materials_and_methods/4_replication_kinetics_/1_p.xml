<p>Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Virus dilutions were prepared in the cell-specific culture medium without serum (infection medium, see “Virus titrations”). After 1 h of virus absorption, cells were washed once with fresh infection medium and cultured in infection medium in the presence or absence of 
 <sc>l</sc>-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (see “Virus titration”). At time points 1, 6, 24, and 48 h postinfection (hpi), 100 μl supernatant was collected and stored at −80°C for subsequent virus titration. All experiments were performed three times (biological replicates), and each experiment was performed with duplicates (technical replicates) from which the average was used for statistical analysis.
