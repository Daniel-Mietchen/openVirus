<p>Five viruses were included in this study, a seasonal H3N2 virus (A/Netherlands/213/2003), pH1N1 virus (A/Netherlands/602/2009), and zoonotic HPAI H5N1 virus (A/Indonesia/5/2005) all isolated from humans. Neurotropic WSN virus (A/WSN/33) and H5N1 virus lacking an MBCS (H5N1
 <sup>ΔMBCS</sup>) were generated using reverse genetics as described before (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>) and passed once on 293T cells and once on MDCK cells. Experiments involving HPAI H5N1 and H5N1
 <sup>ΔMBCS</sup> viruses were performed under biosafety level 3 conditions.
