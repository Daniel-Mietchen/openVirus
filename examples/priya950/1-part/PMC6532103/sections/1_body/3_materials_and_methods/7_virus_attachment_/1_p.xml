<p>For influenza virus histochemistry, viruses were grown, inactivated, and labeled as described previously (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). As a control, uninfected MDCK cells and cell debris were harvested and processed similarly. Subsequently, in a 12-well plate, 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells were seeded, and 1 day later, the near confluent monolayers of MDCK, SK-N-SH, and U87-MG cells were harvested, washed in FACS buffer, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled virus for 1 h at 4°C. After incubation, the cells were washed twice in FACS buffer and measured using a BD FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences, USA). Data were analyzed using FlowJo 10 software (Ashland, OR, USA). All experiments were performed three times (biological replicates), and each experiment was performed with duplicates (technical replicates) from which the average was used for statistical analysis.
