<p>Human neuroblastoma (neuron like, SK-N-SH) and human glioblastoma (astrocyte like, U87-MG) cells were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and maintained in Eagle minimal essential medium (EMEM; Lonza, Breda, the Netherlands) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Lonza), 2 mM glutamine (Lonza), 1.5 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate (Cambrex, Wiesbaden, Germany), sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1× (0.1 mM) nonessential amino acids(MP Biomedicals Europe, Illkirch, France). As a control cell line, we have included Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, since these cells are extensively used for influenza virus propagation. MDCK cells were maintained in EMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 1.5 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate, 1 mM, 10 mM HEPES (Cambrex), and 1× (0.1 mM) nonessential amino acids.</p>
