<p>The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) in cell supernatant was determined by endpoint titration on MDCK cells, as described before (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Briefly, 10-fold serial dilutions of cell supernatants were prepared in infection medium. Infection medium consisted of EMEM, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 1.5 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate, 10 mM HEPES, 1× (0.1 mM) nonessential amino acids, and 1 μg/μl TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Before inoculation, MDCK cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove remaining FBS. One hundred microliters of the diluted supernatant was used to inoculate a confluent monolayer of MDCK cells in 96-well plates. After 1 h at 37°C, the cells were washed once with infection medium, and 200 μl new infection medium was added to each well. Three days after infection, supernatants of infected cell cultures were tested for agglutinating activity using turkey erythrocytes as an indicator of virus replication. The titers of infectivity were calculated from three replicates according to the method of Kärber (

 <sup>1.5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml.
