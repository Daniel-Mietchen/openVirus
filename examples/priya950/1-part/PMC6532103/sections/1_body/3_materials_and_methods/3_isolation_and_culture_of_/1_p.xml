<p>Animals were housed and experiments were conducted in strict compliance with European guidelines (EU directive on animal testing 86/609/EEC) and Dutch legislation (Experiments on Animals Act, 1997). Primary mouse cortex tissue was isolated from embryonic day 17 (E17) to E19 C57BL6 mouse embryos (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA). The cultures were pooled cortexes of several mouse embryos originating from one mother. In brief, the cortex was dissected in ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS; Life Technologies) supplemented with 20 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies) under guidance with a stereomicroscope (Nikon). Next, tissues were cut to ∼1 mm
 <sup>3</sup> using a scalpel and digested using medium consisting of HBSS supplemented with 10 U/ml papain (Sigma), 2.5 U/ml DNase I (Roche), and 4 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich) at 33°C for 15 min. After incubation, cells were washed once in 1 ml of 10% FBS (Life Technologies) in HBSS to stop the digestion. A second “mechanical digestion” was performed by carefully pipetting up and down in digestion buffer (without papain). After washing in HBSS twice, cells were counted using a Moxi Go cell counter (Orflo, Ketchum, ID, USA) and seeded on laminin (500 μg/ml; Sigma)-coated 1.5H 96-well glass-bottomed plates (Cellvis, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at a density of 1.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. For the first 2 h, the cells were cultured in culture medium containing 10% FBS. After 2 h, medium was replaced with fresh culture medium, without FBS. The culture medium contains primary neuron growth medium (PNBM; Lonza), GS-21 supplement (Tebu-Bio, Le-Perray-en-Yvelines, France), 5 μg/ml gentamicin (Thermo Fisher), and 2 mM GlutaMAX (Life Technologies). Half of the medium was changed once per week, and cells were cultured for 7 to 10 days before use.
