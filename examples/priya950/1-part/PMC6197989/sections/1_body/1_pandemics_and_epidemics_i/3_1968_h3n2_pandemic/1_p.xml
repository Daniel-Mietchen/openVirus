<p id="p0025">In 1968, a new worldwide pandemic was caused by an H3N2 influenza A virus. Because the virus was first isolated in Hong Kong, the pandemic caused by this virus has been called the “Hong Kong influenza” pandemic. Previous studies have demonstrated that the H3N2 virus was derived by genetic reassortment with the previously circulating human H2N2 virus acquiring HA and PB1 gene segments from an avian influenza A virus
