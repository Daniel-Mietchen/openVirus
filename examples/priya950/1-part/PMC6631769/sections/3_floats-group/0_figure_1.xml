  <p>Construction of pMP-H1/RBD and characterization of the secreted OMVs-H1/RBD. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs)-vaccination platform to combat MERS-CoV and pandemic 2009 H1N1 (H1N1pdm09). The target sequences of MERS-CoV (RBD, 720 bp, 240 aa) and H1N1pdm09 (HA) were amplified, purified, digested and ligated to pMPccdB vector. The ligated plasmids harboring the target sequences were transformed into bacteria and the secreted OMVs containing recombinant antigens were then purified for evaluation in mice. Abbreviations: NCR: Non-coding region, SP: Signal peptide, RBD: Receptor binding domain (MERS-CoV), L: Nucleotide sequence of peptide linker (GGTAGCGCCGGTAGCGCCGGA), HA1: Hemagglutinin 1, and HA2: Hemagglutinin 2. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Immunoblotting pattern of OMVs, extracted either from various control/non-transformed OMVs (C1, C2, and C3) (empty OMVs) or pMP-H1/RBD-transformed (OMVs-H1/RBD) DH10ÃŸ (S1-S6), against antiserum of swine HA1 antibody.
