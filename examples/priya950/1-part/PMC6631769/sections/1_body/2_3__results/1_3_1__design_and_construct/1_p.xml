<p>As schematically represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00046-f001">Figure 1</xref>a, the pMP-H1/RBD construct comprises of the 3’- Non-Coding Region (NCR) and the signal peptide (SP) of the HA gene from A/Giessen/06/2009 (H1N1pdm2009), followed by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike gene (RBD: 1099-1818 nt = 367-606 amino acids (aa)), a 7-aa flexible linker peptide (LP: GSAGSAG, [
 <xref rid="B22-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) and the coding sequence plus the 5’-NCR of the HA gene. The pMP-H1/RBD is designed to link the RBD and HA0 fragments into a single polypeptide chain. The final fusion protein contains amino acid (aa) residues 1–240 of the RBD, aa residues 1–7 of the LP and aa residues 1-566 of the HA0.
