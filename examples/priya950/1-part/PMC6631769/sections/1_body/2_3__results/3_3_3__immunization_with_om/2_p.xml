<p>At two weeks post-vaccination, mice vaccinated with inactivated H1N1pdm2009 virus or OMVs-H1/RBD revealed a 2–3 × log2 increase in HAI antibody titer as compared to the control and OMVs-empty groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00046-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Four weeks after vaccination we observed a drop in the HAI titers in these mice due to the booster vaccination at week three. Interestingly, the two groups vaccinated with OMVs-H1/RBD or inactivated H1N1pdm2009 showed a significant increase in geometric mean HAI antibody titers to 145.4 (7.2 log2) and 420 (8.7 log2) at week six, and at week eight, the geometric mean HAI antibody titers decreased to 70.7 (6.1 log2) and 210 (7.7 log2), respectively. These results revealed that the vaccinated mice had developed a strong immunogenic response against the H1N1pdm2009 virus. In the negative PBS control group and in the OMVs-empty group HAI titers remained low, reflecting that all animals were indeed housed under influenza-free conditions (no natural infection).
