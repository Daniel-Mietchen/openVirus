<p>Annually, seasonal influenza epidemics attack 10–20% of the human population leading to 290–650 thousand deaths/year worldwide [

Beside these epidemics, the world is confronted every 10–40 years with antigenically distinct pandemic influenza virus strains of wide geographical distribution and considerable human-to-human transmissibility resulting in high mortality rates [
 <xref rid="B5-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In recent years, the world has been challenged with newly emerging influenza A virus (IAV) infections, which have the potential to cause sporadic fatalities in the human population within limited epidemics. For instance, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of the H5N1-subtype and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) of the H7N9-, H10N8- and H6N1-subtypes [

 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have caused sporadic human infections. In addition, other IAVs caused global pandemic outbreaks, such as the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus (H1N1pdm09) [
