<p>To combat IAV and MERS-CoV infections, vaccination represents an affordable and a facile way to protect against devastating epidemics and occasional pandemics. However, despite significant efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine [
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], there are no approved vaccines for MERS-CoV till now. Recent reports have also demonstrated that replication of recombinant IAV vaccine strains in either embryonated eggs or in cell-culture systems allows viral adaptation, which may affect the antigenicity of the vaccine [

 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, genetically and phenotypically stable vaccines represent a promising alternative to control IAV and MERS-CoV infections [
