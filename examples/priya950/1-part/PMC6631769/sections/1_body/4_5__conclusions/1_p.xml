<p>In summary, the results show that the generated (OMVs-H1/RBD)-based vaccine presenting the antigenic stable chimeric fusion protein of H1-type HA of the pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1) strain and RBD of MERS-CoV induces specific neutralizing antibodies against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV leading to protection of immunized mice against both viruses. These results demonstrate that OMVs-based vaccines presenting viral antigens have the potential to be a vaccine platform that provides simultaneous protection against two different viral infections.</p>
