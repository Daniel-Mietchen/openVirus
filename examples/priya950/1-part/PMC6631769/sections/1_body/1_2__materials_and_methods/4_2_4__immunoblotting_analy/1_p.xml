<p>Enriched OMVs (5 µg) from cultured DH10ß, either transformed with empty vector (control) or with pMP-H1/RBD, were mixed with 10 µL 4×  SDS sample buffer (40% glycerol, 240 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 8% SDS, 0.04% bromophenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. The OMVs samples were then separated on precast gradient NuPAGE
 <sup>®</sup> Novex
 <sup>®</sup> 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gels (Invitrogen, USA) and subsequently transferred onto immobilon-FL polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Merck Millipore). Following protein transfer, the PVDF membrane was blocked using blocking buffer (1× TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mM NaCl) containing 5% non-fat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). The membrane was washed once for 5 min using washing buffer (1× TBS-Tween (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween20)). Afterwards, detection of the viral HA1 protein was achieved using rabbit monoclonal antibodies recognizing influenza A virus hemagglutinin (Abcam), diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. 1 h later, the membrane was washed three times for 5 min with washing buffer. Next, the membranes were incubated in the dark for 1 h with the corresponding goat anti-rabbit IRDye (LI-COR, Nebraska, USA), diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer containing a 1:1000 dilution of 10% SDS. After three washing steps (5 min each), twice with washing buffer and once with 1× TBS, the proteins were visualized using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and application software package (LI-COR, Nebraska, USA).
