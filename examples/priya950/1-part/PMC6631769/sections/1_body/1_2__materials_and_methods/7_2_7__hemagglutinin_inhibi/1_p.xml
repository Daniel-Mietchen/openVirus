<p>Sera collected from immunized/control mice were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) from Vibrio cholerae (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) and kept overnight at 37 °C. The RDE was then inactivated by incubation at 56 °C for 1 h. Diluted sera were incubated with four HA units of H1N1pdm and a 1.0% suspension of chicken red blood cells, incubated for 1 h at RT. HAI titer is the reciprocal value of the dilution at which no agglutination was observed. Titers &lt;1:10 were considered as negative.</p>
