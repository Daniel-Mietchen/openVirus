<p>This novel chimeric OMVs-H1/RBD produced high levels of a neutralizing Abs titer against influenza H1N1 virus at 8 weeks post immunization. Stimulated neutralizing Abs (humoral immunity) together with LPS-induced cellular immunity could fully protect immunized mice after challenge with H1N1pdm09 without significant loss in body weight. Surprisingly, the induced non-specific cellular immunity induced by OMVs-empty could partially protect the mice. This emphasize the synergistic effect of humoral and cellular immunities secreted upon vaccination with the chimeric OMVs-H1/RBD formulation. Serum transfer experiments would be able to further elucidate the role of humoral immunity independent of cellular immunity [
