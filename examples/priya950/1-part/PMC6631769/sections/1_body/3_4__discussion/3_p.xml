<p>Traditionally, influenza vaccines are produced by generating a natural or recombinant reassortant IAV expressing the immunogenic HA antigen [

 <xref rid="B32-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The IAV comprises of two subunits HA1 and HA2, hosting the antigenic sites to which specific and neutralizing antibodies are elicited to combat IAVs strains during vaccination or natural infection [

 <xref rid="B33-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, it was reported that the specificity of the vaccine produced in cell-culture and embryonated eggs is occasionally impaired by amino acid (aa) changes, due to seed strain adaptation, with a drastic impact on vaccine effectiveness [

 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The vaccine platform presented in this study depends on plasmid-based bacterial expression of recombinant viral antigen(s). These plasmids, encoding viral antigen(s), can be easily and quickly modified to insert non-synonymous changes in the encoding region of the antigen(s). Additionally, the bacterial expression has lower mutation rates than eukaryotes [
