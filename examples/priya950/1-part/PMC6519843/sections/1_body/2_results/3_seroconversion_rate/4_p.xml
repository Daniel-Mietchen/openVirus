<p>Of the goats that were initially seronegative, 95 were followed up for periods of time ranging between 28 and 482 days, of which 20 (21%) seroconverted. A total of 48.5 animal-years at risk were observed. The overall incidence rate of seroconversion in goats between February 2017 and June 2018 was 0.41 seroconversions per animal-year (95% CI: 0.25â€“0.64) (
