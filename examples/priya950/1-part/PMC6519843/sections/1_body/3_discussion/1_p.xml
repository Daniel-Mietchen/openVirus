<p>This study showed evidence of a high level of exposure to RVFV in the study area, demonstrating active circulation of RVFV in livestock not associated with reported outbreaks, and to our knowledge is the first published study to quantify directly the seroconversion rate in livestock using the gold-standard SNT. Previous studies to detect interepidemic circulation have inferred low-level viral transmission in epidemic-prone areas by ELISA-based detection of IgG or IgM.</p>
