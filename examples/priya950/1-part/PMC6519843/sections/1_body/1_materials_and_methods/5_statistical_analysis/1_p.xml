<p>For samples tested during the cross-sectional study using both the IgG ELISA and the SNT, sensitivity and specificity of the IgG ELISA were estimated, with exact binomial 95% confidence intervals, using the SNT as the gold standard. For animals on which both tests were used, the SNT result was used to define seropositivity, otherwise the IgG ELISA result was used. The RVFV seroprevalence in cattle in June 2016 was calculated overall and by diptank, age group (≤2 y, 2.5–3.5 y, 4–5.5 y, ≥6 y) and sex. For goats the seroprevalence in February 2017 was calculated overall and by age group and sex. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals were calculated and seroprevalence was compared between diptanks (cattle only), age groups and sexes using multiple logistic regression to control for confounding.</p>
