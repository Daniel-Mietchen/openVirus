<p>For each species, the seroconversion rate with 95% confidence interval was plotted over time as the derivative of the kernel-smoothed Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard estimator, using a 60-day kernel width. For this purpose, instead of the midpoint-imputed seroconversion date used above, a randomly selected date between the last negative and first positive test was used for seroconverting animals in order to avoid systematic bias in incidence rate estimation over time [
