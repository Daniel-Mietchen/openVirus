<p>The occurrence of seroconversion was defined as a seronegative result (either during the cross-sectional study as defined above, or during subsequent testing by SNT) followed by a sample from the same animal that tested positive by SNT at a serum dilution of 1:10 or greater. The incidence rate of seroconversion over the 24-month study period (16 months in goats) was then calculated by including all animals that were sampled more than once (irrespective of date of first sampling) and that were seronegative on the first sampling. For the animals that did not seroconvert, animal-time at risk was calculated as the interval between the first and last tests. For animals that did seroconvert, the date of seroconversion was unknown, but was assumed to be the midpoint between the last negative and first positive test. The seroconversion rate was calculated as the number of seroconversions divided by the total animal-years at risk observed, with Poisson exact 95% confidence limits. Estimates were calculated overall for each species, separately for each year of the study (June 2016 to June 2017 and July 2017 to June 2018) and for cattle also separately for each diptank. Associations of age, sex and place with incidence rate were then assessed by including these variables in a multiple Poisson regression model, using animal-time at risk as the exposure variable.</p>
