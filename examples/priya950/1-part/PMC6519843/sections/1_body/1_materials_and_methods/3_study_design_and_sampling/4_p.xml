<p>Animals were selected using systematic random sampling, selecting 2â€“5 animals per farmer at each diptank as they passed through a crush either before or after dipping. Only cattle &gt;6 months old were sampled. Following serological testing of samples from the cross-sectional study, as many seronegative animals as possible, as well as a small number of seropositive animals, were then re-sampled during 13 sampling episodes at 1-2-month intervals between November 2016 and June 2018. To compensate for loss to follow-up, some additional cattle from the same owners were recruited at various times during the study.</p>
