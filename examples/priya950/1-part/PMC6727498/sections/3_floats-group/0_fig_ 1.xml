  <p>Schematic of potential differences between HIV progressor groups in frequency of HIV reactivation from latency. Clearance or control of the latent HIV reservoir remains one of the main obstacles to achieve a functional HIV cure. Although the viral reservoir in HIV-1 infection has been extensively studied, much less is known about the reservoir size or reactivation frequency from this reservoir in HIV-2, and HIV-1 and HIV-2 dual-infection. This figure outlines possible differences in HIV reservoir size and reactivation frequency between the main HIV infection types and progressor groups discussed in this review. The importance of the order of infection in HIV-1 and HIV-2 dual-infection has been highlighted in the figure, and it is likely that the HIV reservoir size and reactivation frequency will differ between depending of the order of HIV infections types</p>
