<p id="Par6">It is well established that blood plasma viral load is lower in HIV-2 compared with HIV-1 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It would therefore make sense that viral replication could largely explain the difference in pathogenicity between the two viruses. Studies of natural disease progression caused by HIV-1 have indicated large variations in viral loads between individuals and the difference in plasma viral load may not fully explain the difference in rate of disease progression between the two virus infections. Interestingly, a recent study showed that CD4+ T-cell levels during the asymptomatic stage of infection was stronger associated with HIV-2 disease progression rate than with CD4+ T-cell decline [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Further studies are therefore needed to determine the causative effects and predictive values of viral load and CD4+ T-cell levels in natural disease progression of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].
