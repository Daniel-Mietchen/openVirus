<p id="Par17">Despite recent disappointments on the possibility of LRAs leading to longstanding remission in HIV-1, there could be a case for trying LRAs and “shock-and-kill” therapies in HIV-2, since it may be a less fit and more sensitive virus. HIV-2 cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses and possibly antibody responses, either broadly neutralizing or mediating ADCC, may partly explain the delayed progression of HIV-1 in patients firstly infected with HIV-2 and later superinfected with HIV-1 [

Hence, if HIV-2 immune responses play a role in controlling the rate of HIV-1 disease progression in individuals with dual-infection, it is plausible that boosting immunity may be able to induce relapse-free remission in HIV-2. There is a need to elicit studies on remission-strategies among HIV-2 infected individuals as these studies hold important promises for achieving an increased understanding of how to achieve remission in HIV-1.
