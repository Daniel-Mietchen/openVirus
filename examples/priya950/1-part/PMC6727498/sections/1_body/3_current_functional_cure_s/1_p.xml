<p id="Par15">As the research field of HIV cure has matured over recent years, it has been necessary to define different concepts of the term ‘cure’ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Within HIV-1 cure research, the aspect of ‘functional cure’ has emerged, or lately ‘relapse-free remission’ to define sustained suppression of virus without the need for ART. This means that a ‘functional cure’ does not have to result in complete absence of HIV in the body. Several different cure strategies have been suggested, e.g. stimulation of the latently infected cells to reduce the reservoir size; gene therapy to reduce the number of target cells; and immunotherapy to ameliorate the HIV-specific immune response [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. An example of naturally occurring ‘functional cure’ are so-called elite controllers, which has been described in a small minority of HIV-1 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. Interestingly, this phenomenon seems to be much more frequent among HIV-2 infected individuals, and it is largely unknown why this is the case [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, there are important lessons to be learned from HIV-2 pathogenesis, and HIV-2 may represent a model to study relapse-free remission and open up new avenues towards how to induce relapse-free remission in HIV-1 infection (Fig.
