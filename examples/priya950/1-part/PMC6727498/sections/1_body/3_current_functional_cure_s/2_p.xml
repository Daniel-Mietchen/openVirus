<p id="Par16">Antiretroviral treatment effectively suppresses, but does not cure HIV infection. Multiple therapeutic strategies have been pursued in HIV cure research, but there has been a particular focus on using latency-reversing-agents (LRAs) such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), disulfiram, Protein C kinase agonists and Toll-like Receptor agonists, to activate HIV-expression in latently infected cells, and thereby exposing their infected status to the immune system and potentially facilitating immune or virus-mediated cell lysis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Yet, although clinical trials of many of these compounds have demonstrated that HIV latency can be disrupted in individuals on suppressive ART, this does not lead to a reduction in the frequency of latently infected cells or delayed viral rebound during analytical interruption of ART [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. More recently, attempts to reverse latency with compounds that both activate virus and modulate immunity to enhance clearance of infected cells (so-called immunomodulatory LRAs), have been made [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. The inability of latency-reversal interventions to impact the latent HIV reservoir in clinical trials has increased the scientific focus on immune-enhancement strategies towards a concept of relapse-free remission after cessation of therapy. This is also supported by the demonstration that even in individuals with no or extremely low levels of HIV in cells or plasma, there is rebound viraemia when ART is stopped [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. This emphasizes that an effective strategy to achieve long-term ART-free remission should include both a component that reduces the amount of HIV that persists on ART, and a component that improves anti-HIV immune surveillance of residual viruses. This could involve immune-based therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors, TLR agonists, or HIV-specific broadly neutralising antibodies, which are currently under intense investigation for application in HIV prevention, treatment and cure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. Additionally, starting ART shortly after infection has been a focus area, as this is associated with both a lower frequency of latently infected CD4+ T-cells in blood and tissue, and a better preserved T-cell function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. Furthermore, early ART increases the likelihood of post-treatment control, i.e. the ability to achieve durable remission after interruption of ART, which was started in primary infection—a phenomenon initially described in the French VISCONTI cohort [
