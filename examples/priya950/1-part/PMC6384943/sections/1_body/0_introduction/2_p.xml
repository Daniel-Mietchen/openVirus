<p id="Par3">Seasonal influenza is a threat to public health, and issuing of pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings can prevent potential epidemics. A pre-epidemic warning signifies that a massive epidemic can occur within the next four weeks, while an epidemic warning is issued when there are suspicions that a massive epidemic is ongoing or has been persisting. Pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings are basically issued in PHC units, contributing to the early grasp of infection spread and provision of a heads-up to PHC jurisdictions.</p>
