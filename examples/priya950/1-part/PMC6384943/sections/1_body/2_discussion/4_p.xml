 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>t</sub> can be estimated with high accuracy if the reporting interval is set at approximately 3 days. Because weekly reports are aggregated in units of seven days, the average serial interval is greatly exceeded. Additionally, Nishiura 
 <italic>et al</italic>. also proposed a correction method for estimating 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>t</sub> in cases in which the reporting interval is not consistent with the serial interval. However, we focused not only on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>t</sub> estimation but also on the movement of populations and the consequent movement of infections between jurisdictions, and we used different models in this study. In the model adopted, data regarding the number of infected cases per day are necessary. Because the cumulative cases obtained by weekly reports during the epidemic roughly followed a cubic function, we estimated the number of infected cases per day by applying a cubic spline function as in a previous study

 </sup>. Moreover, because there were jurisdictions in which Weekly CPS and estimated value by the spline function deviated from each other, it was impossible to deny the existence of a possible bias associated with the estimated value. However, the observed and the estimated values were well-fitted, and the use of the spline function in this study was not necessarily denied.
