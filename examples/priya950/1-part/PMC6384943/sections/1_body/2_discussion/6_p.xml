 <sub>t</sub> exceeded 1.0 at the time of the issue of the pre-epidemic warning report, and we believe that new method of epidemic evaluation needs to be considered while setting the reference value for pre-epidemic warnings. Although the definition of the warning report is as described in the introduction, it was indicated that pre-epidemic warnings are useful as indices of the time to implement countermeasures against a future epidemic.
