 <sub>t</sub> were: Miyazaki city (1.9–2.0), Chuo (1.9–2.9), Miyakonojo (1.4–1.5), Nobeoka (1.4–1.6), Nichinan (1.6–1.8), Kobayashi (1.7–1.8), Takanabe (1.5–1.8), Takachiho (0.9–1.3), and Hyuga (1.1–1.2) when the pre-epidemic warning at each jurisdiction was issued, and Weekly CPS was higher than 10.0. Therefore, all the lower 95% credible interval limits were higher than 1.0, except that for Takachiho at the time of issual of the pre-epidemic warning. All the

 <sub>t</sub> values were lower than 1.0 when Weekly CPS value was lower than the reference value for the end of the epidemic warning (i.e. 10.0). Furthermore, once Weekly CPS was lower than 10.0, it exceeded 10.0 again in all the jurisdictions except Takachiho. Particularly, in Miyazaki city, Chuo, and Nobeoka, the value reached 30.0 again which is the reference value for epidemic warnings. In the case of a secondary epidemic, all the lower 95% credible interval limits were also higher than 1.0 except in Takachiho.
