<p id="Par6">During the 2010–2011 influenza season in Miyazaki Prefecture, the first case was reported in the Miyakonojo PHC; Weekly CPS in Miyakonojo was 0.3 at the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2010 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In all the PHC jurisdictions, one or more phases in which Weekly CPS shifted from a decrease to an increase were observed, and a secondary epidemic defined in the introduction section was confirmed without Takachiho. According to a national population census conducted in 2010, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the population of each jurisdiction and the estimated number of people who moved between jurisdictions. The outflow population was large in the order of Takanabe, Miyakonojo, and Miyazaki city, and inflow population was in the order of Miyazaki city, Miyakonojo, and Takanabe. The ratio of population influx and efflux to the night-time population was large in the order of Takanabe, Chuo, and Hyuga with respect to influx and Chuo, Takanabe, and Kobayashi with respect to efflux. The epidemic ended in the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week of 2010, in which Weekly CPS was higher than 0 at least in one jurisdiction. Similarly, the epidemic started in the 27
 <sup>th</sup> week of 2011, and Weekly CPS became 0 in all the jurisdictions. Before the start of the epidemic, Weekly CPS continued to be 0 for two consecutive weeks from the 39
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2010, and also continued to be 0 for two consecutive weeks till the 26
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2011 after the end of the epidemic. Therefore, we evaluated the predictability of the spline model according to the Akaike’s information criterion (AIC), which had the highest applicability when the beginning and end of the epidemic were set at the 38
 <sup>th</sup> week of 2010 and the 26
 <sup>th</sup> week of 2011, respectively.
