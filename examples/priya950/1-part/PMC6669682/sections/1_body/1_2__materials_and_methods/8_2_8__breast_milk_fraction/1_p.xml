<p>The fractionation of human breast milk was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, 10 mL pooled thawed breast milk was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000–20,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C to skim the fat (cream) from milk. Next, cream was resuspended in 10 mL PBS and the skim milk was ultracentrifuged at 100,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 90 min at 4 °C to separate caseins from serum proteins. The casein-containing pellet was resuspended in 10 mL PBS and the supernatant (whey) was collected.
