<p>Human breast milk was donated by healthy volunteering nursing mothers after informed consent had been signed. None of the mothers reported stays in ZIKV endemic regions or previous infections with flaviviruses. Samples were collected into sterile 50 mL Falcon tubes immediately before breastfeeding and either used for analysis within 30–60 min after donation or after long-term (&gt;6 months) storage at −20 °C. All procedures were approved by the local ethics committee of Ulm University (337/18, 19 September 2018). </p>
