<p>To determine the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>), ZIKV stocks were serially diluted 10-fold and used to inoculate Vero E6 cells. To this end, 6000 Vero E6 cells were seeded per well in 96 flat-bottom well plates in 100 µL medium and incubated over night before 80 µL fresh medium was added. Next, 20 µL titrated ZIKV of each dilution was used for inoculation, resulting in final ZIKV dilutions of 1:10
 <sup>1</sup> to 1:10
 <sup>9</sup> on the cells in triplicates. Cells were then incubated for at least 6 days and monitored for cytopathic effect. TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL was calculated according to Reed and Muench.
