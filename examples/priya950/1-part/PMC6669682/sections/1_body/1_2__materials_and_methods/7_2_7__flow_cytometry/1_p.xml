<p>For infection, 100,000 Vero E6 cells were seeded in 24 well plates in 500 µL medium, incubated overnight, and then replaced by 180 µL fresh medium. Cells were then inoculated with 20 µL ZIKV that was treated for 10 min with thawed human milk. After 2 h, the inoculum was removed, cells were washed with PBS and fresh medium was added. Three days post infection, cells were detached (0.05% trypsin in PBS) and flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine infection rates. Specifically, cells were washed with PBS and stained with fixable viability stain 450 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by a washing step. Next, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min. Cells were then washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (1% (

 <sub>2</sub>, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 0.5% Triton X-100 in H
 <sub>2</sub>O). Cells were washed with 0.1% (

 <italic>v</italic>) Tween 20 in PBS and incubated with mouse anti-flavivirus protein E antibody 4G2 (in PBS containing 0.1% (

After a next washing step, cells were incubated with a secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher #A11001, Waltham, MA, USA) for 30 min at room temperature protected from light. After further washing steps, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer and analyzed in a BD FACS Canto™ II Cell Analyzer and evaluated with BD FACS Diva™ and FlowJo 7 software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
