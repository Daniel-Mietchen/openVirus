<p>The African ZIKV strain MR766 was isolated in 1947 from a sentinel rhesus macaque [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Asian and pathogenic strains PRVABC59 or FB-GWUH-2016 were isolated in 2015 from a human serum specimen [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] or from a fetal brain with severe abnormalities [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], respectively. For virus propagation see [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In brief, 70% confluent Vero E6 cells in 175 cm²-cell culture flasks were inoculated with ZIKV in 5 ml medium for 2 h, before 40 mL medium was added. Cells were monitored for 3 to 5 days and supernatant was harvested when 70% of the cells detached due to cytopathic effects. Supernatants were centrifuged for 3 min at 325× 
 <italic>g</italic> to remove cellular debris, and then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C as virus stocks. The infectious virus titer was determined by the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) titration and the genome copy number of the stocks was assessed by RT-qPCR.
