<p>The effect of human breast milk on the metabolic activity of the cells was analyzed using the CellTiter-Glo
 <sup>®</sup> Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega #G7571, Madison, WI, USA). It was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions under conditions corresponding to the respective infection assays. Briefly, the medium was removed from the culture after 2 days of incubation and 50 µL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 50 µL substrate reagent were added. After 10 min, the luminescence of the samples was measured in an Orion II Microplate Luminometer (Titertek Berthold, Pforzheim, Germany). Untreated controls were set to 100% viability.
