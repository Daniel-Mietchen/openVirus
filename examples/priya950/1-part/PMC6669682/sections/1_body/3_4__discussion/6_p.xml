<p>Recent reviews investigated transmission from ZIKV-infected mothers to their children and did not find evidence for efficient ZIKV transmission via breastfeeding, despite the presence of virus in breast milk [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This is in line with the findings in a mouse model, where infectious ZIKV was detected in breast milk but did not result in transmission to pups [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The finding by others and us that ZIKV is inactivated in milk before and after feeding provides a plausible explanation for the rare event of transmission by breastfeeding.
