<p>Pfaender et al. have demonstrated that Holder pasteurization (62.5 Â°C for 30 min) of ZIKV-contaminated milk effectively destroys viral infectivity [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although pasteurization is effective, it may not be applicable under resource-poor settings. Our results and those by Pfaender et al. show that storage of milk from ZIKV-infected mothers in the fridge for at least 2 days may in the majority of cases reduce or even eliminate risk of ZIKV transmission to the infant. Thus, storage of milk in the fridge might provide an interesting alternative to pasteurization. However, possible donor variations and the limited sample size tested preclude making generalized recommendations.
