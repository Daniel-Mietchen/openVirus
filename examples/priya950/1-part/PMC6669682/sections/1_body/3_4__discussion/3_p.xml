<p>What is the nature of the anti-ZIKV factor in milk and how is it generated? We can exclude that ZIKV neutralizing antibodies in milk are responsible as the fresh milk samples did not show anti-ZIKV activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, the fact that the antiviral factor is generated during incubation at all tested temperatures suggests that it is also not of bacterial origin as bacteria do not grow and produce toxins at −20 °C. We found that the antiviral activity in milk is directed against the ZIKV particle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>a) and results in a rapid destruction of viral particle integrity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>b,c). Furthermore, the fat containing cream fraction of milk contains the antiviral factor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). These findings are very similar to those obtained by Pfaender et al. on HCV, another member of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. In this study, the authors show that lipases in milk generate free fatty acids that destroy the membrane of HCV particles [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This is a common antiviral property of fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and their release and antiviral activity in milk has been demonstrated for enveloped viruses of different families [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Mechanistically, it has been discussed that the free fatty acids likely form micellar structures and interact with or are even incorporated into the viral membrane, thus destabilizing it [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The two lipases in human breast milk are the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and the bile salt-stimulate lipase (BSSL), which are associated with the casein fraction [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It is well-described for bovine and has also been observed for human milk that upon cooling at 4 °C, LPL migrates from the casein to the cream fraction, resulting in increased free fatty acid release (“cooling activation”) [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Furthermore, the milk-fat-globule membrane that protects lipids from direct lipolysis by LPL can be ruptured by agitation, foaming (and likely also vortexing), or freezing [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] allowing access for LPL to the core lipids, subsequent lipolysis and generation of antivirally active fatty acids. Similarly, it has been reported that BSSL, typically dependent on bile salts in the infant’s stomach, is also activated after freezing [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Thus, collectively these data suggest that lipases released or activated during processing of milk samples are responsible for the generation of free fatty acids that destroy the ZIKV membrane. Moreover, the fat composition of milk also differs between and within individuals, which may explain the observed donor variations [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Pfaender et al. proposed that in addition to bile salt BSSL activation in the infant’s stomach [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], gastric lipases may also release antivirally active fatty acids upon breast feeding [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Especially in combination, this may result in high levels of antiviral fatty acids and thus inactivation of ZIKV in the infant’s stomach and subsequently reduced rates of transmission. This is in line with observations that antiviral fatty acids are found in infants’ stomachs one hour after breast feeding [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, further studies are required to clarify the exact mechanism underlying the anti-ZIKV activity of human breast milk and to examine its antiviral potency against other enveloped viruses.
