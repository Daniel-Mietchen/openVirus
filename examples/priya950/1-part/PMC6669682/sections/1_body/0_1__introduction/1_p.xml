<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a (re-)emerging virus that was originally identified in 1947 in Uganda [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] but has now caused a series of epidemics in Micronesia [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the South Pacific [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the Americas [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To date, 84 countries or territories reported ZIKV transmissions [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Initially considered a harmless infection in humans, ZIKV may cause disease in adults, including meningoencephalitis [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], myelitis [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], thrombocytopenia [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Guillain–Barré syndrome [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is now established that ZIKV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, where it can cause fetal demise, microcephaly, and other congenital problems [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which may develop in up to 46% of the cases [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, ZIKV infection poses a high risk for human health, as vaccines and therapeutics are not available.
