<p>Breast milk is a body fluid that nurtures and protects the infant. It is rich in nutrients and vitamins and provides the child with carbohydrates, proteins, fat, minerals, hormones, growth factors and antibodies [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Here, we aimed to expand this finding and explored ZIKV stability at physiological temperatures and how breast milk may directly affect ZIKV infection. We show that fresh human milk had no significant effect on ZIKV infection, however, storage of milk resulted in the generation of a potent anti-ZIKV factor. Similar to earlier findings for hepatitis C virus (HCV), this factor is dominant in the fat-containing cream fraction and possibly released by lipases present in milk or gastric juice [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This factor rapidly abrogates infectivity by physical destruction of the viral particle and may play a role in virus inactivation upon storage of milk for later use or in the gastrointestinal tract of babies upon breastfeeding. This might explain why ZIKV transmission via breastfeeding is hardly observed.
