<p>Next, we assessed whether storage of ZIKV contaminated milk in the fridge or the freezer may allow virus inactivation. Thus, the three ZIKV strains were spiked into fresh milk or buffer and incubated for up to 10 days at 4 °C (

 <sub>50</sub> analysis revealed that incubation at 4 °C for 2 days led to an entire loss of ZIKV infectivity in both milk samples (

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Incubation at −20 °C, however, had not significant effects on viral titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>d). Thus, storage of milk from a ZIKV infected mother at 4 °C but not at −20 °C reduces viral titers over time and should thus limit ZIKV transmission by breast milk feeding.
