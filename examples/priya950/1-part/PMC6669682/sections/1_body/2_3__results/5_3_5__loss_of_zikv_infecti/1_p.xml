<p>We next analyzed the stability of the virus in milk during storage. Pfaender et al., analyzed storage of ZIKV in milk at 4 °C and pasteurization at 63 °C [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Here, we explored storage of milk at physiological and common temperatures of 37 °C and 22 °C. For this, freshly donated milk (or PBS as control) was spiked with ZIKV MR766, GWUH or PRV, and incubated for up to 8 h at 37 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>a) or 22 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). Viral infectivity was determined at indicated time points by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> analysis showing that ZIKV that was incubated in PBS remained fully infectious, even after incubation for 8 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Similarly, the incubation of ZIKV in milk at 22 °C did not affect ZIKV infectivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). In contrast, the incubation of ZIKV in milk for 8 h at 37 °C resulted in a 97% or 99% reduction in viral titers for donor 4 or 5, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, MR766). Similarly, titers of GWUH or PRV were reduced by 99% or 44% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, GWUH) and 99% or 90% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, PRV) for the two donors. These data show that under physiological conditions of 37 °C, ZIKV may be inactivated in breast milk.
