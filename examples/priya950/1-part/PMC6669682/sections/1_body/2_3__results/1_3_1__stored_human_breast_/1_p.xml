 <sub>50</sub>-adjusted amounts of virus were mixed with equal volumes of serially diluted pooled breast milk. After incubation for 10 min, the mixtures were used to inoculate Vero E6 cells, resulting in a 10-fold dilution of the virus/milk mixture. After 2 h, the inoculum was replaced with fresh medium, and ZIKV infection rates were quantified 2 days later by a ZIKV E antigen specific cell-based immunodetection assay. To detect possible confounding cytotoxic effects of the breast milk, the same experiments were performed in the absence of virus and, after 2 days, intracellular ATP levels were determined by CellTiter-Glo Assay.
