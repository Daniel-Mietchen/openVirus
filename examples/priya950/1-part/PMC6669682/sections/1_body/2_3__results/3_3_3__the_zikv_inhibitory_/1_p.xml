<p>To clarify which component in milk is responsible for the observed anti-ZIKV activity, pooled long-term stored milk was separated by low speed centrifugation into cream and skim milk, as described [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Skim milk was further fractionated by high-speed centrifugation into the pellet containing caseins and into the supernatant called whey [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. None of the milk fractions reduced metabolic activity of Vero E6 cells at final cell culture concentrations of up to 2% (

 <sub>50</sub> of 0.85 ± 0.15% during virion treatment) that was comparable to whole milk (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.41 ± 0.03%) (

 <sub>50</sub> of 13.12 ± 1.31 and 15.23 ± 1.19%, respectively) whereas the casein fraction had no effect (
