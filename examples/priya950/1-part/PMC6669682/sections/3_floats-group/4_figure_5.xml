  <p>Effect of storage and temperature on the anti-ZIKV activity of milk. Fresh breast milk was received from three donors and, after 30 min, was mixed 1:1 with ZIKV MR766 (1.58 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL) at indicated concentrations and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Mixtures were then diluted 10-fold onto Vero E6 cells and incubated for 2 h before the medium was changed. Additionally, the breast milk was incubated at (
   <bold>a</bold>) 37 °C, (
   <bold>b</bold>) 22 °C, (
   <bold>c</bold>) 4 °C, or (
   <bold>d</bold>) −20 °C for indicated time points before mixing with ZIKV and inoculation of Vero E6 cells. Infection rates were determined 2 days later by a cell-based immunodetection assay that enzymatically quantifies the flavivirus protein E. Infection data are normalized to infection rates in the absence of the respective breast milk sample and represent average values obtained from triplicate infections ± standard deviations. See also
