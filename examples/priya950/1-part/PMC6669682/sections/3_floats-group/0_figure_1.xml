  <p>Effect of long-term frozen breast milk on ZIKV infection. (
   <bold>a</bold>) ZIKV MR766, GWUH or PRV (MR766: 1.58, GWUH: 2.51, PRV: 1.58 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL) were mixed 1:1 with thawed breast milk at indicated concentrations and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Milk was stored for more than 6 months at −20 °C. ZIKV/milk mixtures were then used to inoculate Vero E6 cells resulting in a 10-fold dilution of the samples. Then, 2 h later, the medium was changed and, 2 days later, the infection rates were determined by a cell-based immunodetection assay that enzymatically quantifies the flavivirus protein E. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Vero E6 cells were incubated with thawed pooled breast milk at indicated concentrations for 2 h. The medium was then replaced, and the cellular viability was determined 2 days later by CellTiter-Glo Assay. Data are normalized to viability in the absence of milk. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Thawed breast milk from four individual donors was incubated with ZIKV MR766 (1.58 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL) at indicated concentrations before inoculation of Vero E6 cells as described in (
   <bold>a</bold>). Infection data are normalized to infection rates in the absence of the respective sample. Data are represented as average values obtained from triplicate infections ± standard deviations.
