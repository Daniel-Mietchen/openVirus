  <p>Effect of fresh milk on ZIKV infection. Fresh breast milk was received from three donors and, after 30 min, was mixed 1:1 with ZIKV MR766 (1.58 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL) at indicated concentrations and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Mixtures were then diluted 10-fold onto Vero E6 cells and incubated for 2 h before the medium was changed. Infection rates were determined 2 days later by an E protein immunodetection assay. Infection data are normalized to infection rates in the absence of the respective breast milk sample and represent average values obtained from triplicate infections ± standard deviations.
