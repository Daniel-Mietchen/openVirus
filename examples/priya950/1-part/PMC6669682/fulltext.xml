The virus has been detected in human breast milk and possible transmissions via breastfeeding have been reported. Breast milk is rich in nutrients and bio-active substances that might directly affect viral infectivity. Thus, here, we analyzed the effect of human breast milk on ZIKV infection. We observed that fresh human breast milk had no effect on ZIKV, but found that upon storage, milk effectively suppressed infection. The antiviral activity is present in the fat-containing cream fraction of milk and results in the destruction of the structural integrity of viral particles, thereby abrogating infectivity. The release of the factor is time dependent but varies with donors and incubation temperatures. The viral titer of milk that was spiked with ZIKV decreased considerably upon storage at 37 &#x000b0;C for 8 h, was lost entirely after 2 days of 4 &#x000b0;C storage, but was not affected at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C. This suggests that cold storage of milk inactivates ZIKV and that the antiviral factor in milk may also be generated upon breastfeeding and limit this transmission route of ZIKV. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>zika virus</kwd><kwd>breast milk</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd><kwd>breastfeeding</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-11-00591"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a (re-)emerging virus that was originally identified in 1947 in Uganda [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] but has now caused a series of epidemics in Micronesia [<xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the South Pacific [<xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the Americas [<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To date, 84 countries or territories reported ZIKV transmissions [<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Initially considered a harmless infection in humans, ZIKV may cause disease in adults, including meningoencephalitis [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], myelitis [<xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], thrombocytopenia [<xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome [<xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is now established that ZIKV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, where it can cause fetal demise, microcephaly, and other congenital problems [<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which may develop in up to 46% of the cases [<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, ZIKV infection poses a high risk for human health, as vaccines and therapeutics are not available.</p><p>ZIKV is mainly transmitted to people through the bite of an infected <italic>Aedes</italic> species mosquito [<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This vector-dependent route of transmission mainly restricts the ZIKV pandemic to regions where the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes are endemic [<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. ZIKV transmission has also been reported to occur through sexual contacts [<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], laboratory exposure and blood transfusion [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or from mother to child intrauterine [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], intrapartum [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or possibly via breastfeeding [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. There are three reported cases of probable ZIKV transmission via breast milk [<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but final evidence and risk of transmission remain inconclusive [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As evidence is sparse and the health benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the transmission risk, the WHO recommends mothers with suspected, probable or confirmed ZIKV infection or in areas of ongoing ZIKV transmission to routinely continue breastfeeding [<xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, there are clear data that ZIKV is present in various body fluids [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] including breast milk, that contains ZIKV genomic RNA [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and infectious particles [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, although the virus can be detected and quantified by RT-PCR in breast milk and other body fluids, viral genome copy numbers do not always correlate with the infectious titer of the virus [<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Breast milk is a body fluid that nurtures and protects the infant. It is rich in nutrients and vitamins and provides the child with carbohydrates, proteins, fat, minerals, hormones, growth factors and antibodies [<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Breast milk can be a source of viral infection [<xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but also contains bioactive substances that may directly affect viral infectivity [<xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A recent study analyzed the stability of ZIKV in breast milk at 4 &#x000b0;C and found that ZIKV is inactivated upon prolonged storage [<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Here, we aimed to expand this finding and explored ZIKV stability at physiological temperatures and how breast milk may directly affect ZIKV infection. We show that fresh human milk had no significant effect on ZIKV infection, however, storage of milk resulted in the generation of a potent anti-ZIKV factor. Similar to earlier findings for hepatitis C virus (HCV), this factor is dominant in the fat-containing cream fraction and possibly released by lipases present in milk or gastric juice [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This factor rapidly abrogates infectivity by physical destruction of the viral particle and may play a role in virus inactivation upon storage of milk for later use or in the gastrointestinal tract of babies upon breastfeeding. This might explain why ZIKV transmission via breastfeeding is hardly observed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-11-00591"><title>2.

Breast Milk</title><p>Human breast milk was donated by healthy volunteering nursing mothers after informed consent had been signed. None of the mothers reported stays in ZIKV endemic regions or previous infections with flaviviruses. Samples were collected into sterile 50 mL Falcon tubes immediately before breastfeeding and either used for analysis within 30&#x02013;60 min after donation or after long-term (&#x0003e;6 months) storage at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C.

ZIKV stocks were diluted to the desired multiplicity of infection (MOI). In the &#x0201c;virion treatment&#x0201d; setting, virus was then mixed (1:1) with serially titrated breast milk samples and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Then, cells were inoculated with 20 &#x000b5;L of the mixture in triplicates (resulting in a 10-fold lower concentration of the milk samples) and incubated for 2 h before the medium was replaced by fresh medium. Alternatively, cells were first incubated with the breast milk samples for 10 min, followed by ZIKV inoculation (&#x0201c;cell treatment&#x0201d;). Two days post infection, the flavivirus E protein content in the cells was quantified by cell-based immunodetection assay as described [<xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To this end, the medium was removed, and the plates were washed with PBS once before fixing the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min at room temperature. After aspirating PFA, cells were permeabilized by incubation with 100% ice cold methanol for 5 min, and again washed with PBS.

To this end, a ZIKV MR766 stock containing ~10<sup>10</sup> genomic RNA copies/mL was incubated with 90% PBS, 0.5% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, or 90% thawed breast milk for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C.

As control (determining the total RNA), one aliquot was in parallel incubated with PBS. After treatment, the samples were analyzed for remaining RNA copy numbers.

For this, three virus strains were used: the prototype African MR766 strain isolated from a rhesus macaque [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the more recent and Asian lineage derived strains FB-GWUH-2016 (GWUH) which was isolated from a fetal brain with severe abnormalities [<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and PRVABC59 (PRV), which was obtained from a human serum specimen [<xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. TCID<sub>50</sub>-adjusted amounts of virus were mixed with equal volumes of serially diluted pooled breast milk. After incubation for 10 min, the mixtures were used to inoculate Vero E6 cells, resulting in a 10-fold dilution of the virus/milk mixture. After 2 h, the inoculum was replaced with fresh medium, and ZIKV infection rates were quantified 2 days later by a ZIKV E antigen specific cell-based immunodetection assay. To detect possible confounding cytotoxic effects of the breast milk, the same experiments were performed in the absence of virus and, after 2 days, intracellular ATP levels were determined by CellTiter-Glo Assay.</p><p>Initially, we used breast milk that was pooled from long-term frozen samples of four individual donors.

To exclude that milk proteins may interfere with viral quantification by the enzymatic readout of the cell-based immunodetection assay, we also applied flow cytometry of ZIKV-infected cells. As shown (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00591">Figure S1</xref>b,c), concentrations of &#x02265;0.5% of milk reduced the percentage of infected cells from 82% to below 1%. Similar results were obtained when analyzing the mean fluorescence intensities of the cultures (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00591">Figure S1</xref>d). The anti-ZIKV activity of breast milk was confirmed with freeze-stored samples derived from four independent nursing mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f001">Figure 1</xref>c).

The Anti-ZIKV Factor in Milk Destroys the Structural Integrity of the Virion</title><p>To test whether milk acts on the virus or the cell, ZIKV was incubated with up to 20% of pooled breast milk for 10 min (&#x0201c;virion treatment&#x0201d;) and then added to cells, resulting in a 10-fold dilution of the inoculum, and final cell culture concentrations of up to 2% of milk. Simultaneously, Vero E6 cells were first incubated with breast milk at concentrations of up to 2% for 10 min, before ZIKV was added (&#x0201c;cell treatment&#x0201d;). Thus, in both treatments the final milk concentrations in cell culture are the same, however, due to virion pre-exposure with 10-fold higher concentrations different outcomes could arise if the antiviral factors target the virion. After 2 h, the supernatants were exchanged with fresh medium, and viral infection was quantified 2 days later. Under both conditions, milk inhibited ZIKV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). However, milk concentrations during virion treatment determined the magnitude of virus inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> virion: 0.27 &#x000b1; 0.04%; IC<sub>50</sub> cell: 1.02 &#x000b1; 0.09%), showing that the antiviral activity in milk is directed against the virus. We next analyzed whether milk may directly disrupt virion integrity, applying a protocol established for HCV [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In brief, virions were exposed to PBS, detergents SDS or Triton X-100, or pooled (stored) milk for one hour at 37 &#x000b0;C. Thereafter, a ribonuclease was added to degrade free genomic viral RNA released from destroyed virions. Next, ZIKV RNA (total and remaining) was quantified by RT-qPCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>b, comparable numbers of viral genome copies per mL (10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup>) were detected in all control samples, demonstrating that detergents or milk components do not interfere with RT-qPCR-based detection of viral genomes. RNase treatment, however, resulted in an almost entire loss of viral RNA when virions were exposed to breast milk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Similarly, a more than 99% reduction in viral genome copies was determined upon detergent treatment. Next, we analyzed how fast ZIKV is inactivated by milk. We found that incubating ZIKV with 0.5% milk for only one minute did not reduce viral infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>c). However, infectivity decreased in a time-dependent manner and was lost entirely after 30 min of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>c). These data show that the antiviral factor in breast milk interacts with Zika virions in a way that results in the rapid release of genomic RNA, which can only be achieved by physical destruction of the viral particles, explaining loss of infectivity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-11-00591"><title>3.3.

Fresh Milk Does Not Inhibit ZIKV Infection but Becomes Antivirally Active in a Time-Dependent Manner</title><p>Our finding that milk has potent anti-ZIKV activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f003">Figure 3</xref>) was obtained with human breast milk that was stored and frozen at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C for prolonged periods of time. To corroborate our results with fresh samples, milk was obtained from three nursing mothers and analyzed within 30 min after donation. Conversely, none of the fresh milk samples inhibited ZIKV, even at concentrations of up 50% during virion treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f004">Figure 4</xref>). We next studied whether storage of these fresh milk samples may result in a gain of anti-ZIKV activity. In fact, upon incubation at 37 &#x000b0;C for several hours, all milk samples reduced ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). We observed some donor variation, e.g., the milk of donor 1 and 2 became antivirally active already after 1&#x02013;2 h whereas the milk of donor 3 inhibited ZIKV only when incubated for 8 hours or longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). Similar results were obtained if milk was incubated at 22 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). We were then wondering how storage of milk at 4 &#x000b0;C would impact antiviral activity. Milk derived from donor 1 and 2 became slightly more antivirally active as compared to the 37 &#x000b0;C condition, however for donor 3 we observed an opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>c). Finally, freezing milk at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C resulted in slightly increased antiviral activities of donor 1, but not donor 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>d).

Here, we explored storage of milk at physiological and common temperatures of 37 &#x000b0;C and 22 &#x000b0;C. For this, freshly donated milk (or PBS as control) was spiked with ZIKV MR766, GWUH or PRV, and incubated for up to 8 h at 37 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>a) or 22 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>b).

Similarly, the incubation of ZIKV in milk at 22 &#x000b0;C did not affect ZIKV infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). In contrast, the incubation of ZIKV in milk for 8 h at 37 &#x000b0;C resulted in a 97% or 99% reduction in viral titers for donor 4 or 5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, MR766).

Anti-ZIKV activity varied greatly between donors and was affected by temperature and incubation times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Some samples became antivirally active as quickly as after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>c+d, donor 1+2), whereas others hardly inhibited infection after 10 h of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>d, donor 3). Overall, the antiviral activity increased in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that the antiviral factor is generated over time. Surprisingly, however, after 10 h of incubation, IC<sub>50</sub> values were not as low as for milk that was stored for more than 6 months at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). This suggests that a continuous incubation might further increase milk&#x02019;s antiviral activity, probably until a maximum activity is reached.</p><p>What is the nature of the anti-ZIKV factor in milk and how is it generated? We can exclude that ZIKV neutralizing antibodies in milk are responsible as the fresh milk samples did not show anti-ZIKV activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, the fact that the antiviral factor is generated during incubation at all tested temperatures suggests that it is also not of bacterial origin as bacteria do not grow and produce toxins at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C. We found that the antiviral activity in milk is directed against the ZIKV particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>a) and results in a rapid destruction of viral particle integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>b,c). Furthermore, the fat containing cream fraction of milk contains the antiviral factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). These findings are very similar to those obtained by Pfaender et al. on HCV, another member of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. In this study, the authors show that lipases in milk generate free fatty acids that destroy the membrane of HCV particles [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This is a common antiviral property of fatty acids [<xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and their release and antiviral activity in milk has been demonstrated for enveloped viruses of different families [<xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Mechanistically, it has been discussed that the free fatty acids likely form micellar structures and interact with or are even incorporated into the viral membrane, thus destabilizing it [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

It is well-described for bovine and has also been observed for human milk that upon cooling at 4 &#x000b0;C, LPL migrates from the casein to the cream fraction, resulting in increased free fatty acid release (&#x0201c;cooling activation&#x0201d;) [<xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Furthermore, the milk-fat-globule membrane that protects lipids from direct lipolysis by LPL can be ruptured by agitation, foaming (and likely also vortexing), or freezing [<xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] allowing access for LPL to the core lipids, subsequent lipolysis and generation of antivirally active fatty acids. Similarly, it has been reported that BSSL, typically dependent on bile salts in the infant&#x02019;s stomach, is also activated after freezing [<xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Thus, collectively these data suggest that lipases released or activated during processing of milk samples are responsible for the generation of free fatty acids that destroy the ZIKV membrane. Moreover, the fat composition of milk also differs between and within individuals, which may explain the observed donor variations [<xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Pfaender et al. proposed that in addition to bile salt BSSL activation in the infant&#x02019;s stomach [<xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], gastric lipases may also release antivirally active fatty acids upon breast feeding [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Especially in combination, this may result in high levels of antiviral fatty acids and thus inactivation of ZIKV in the infant&#x02019;s stomach and subsequently reduced rates of transmission. This is in line with observations that antiviral fatty acids are found in infants&#x02019; stomachs one hour after breast feeding [<xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, further studies are required to clarify the exact mechanism underlying the anti-ZIKV activity of human breast milk and to examine its antiviral potency against other enveloped viruses. </p><p>Besides determining the effect of milk on ZIKV infection, we also analyzed how milk affects ZIKV infectivity that was spiked into the body fluid, a setting which more closely reflects the in vivo situation. We observed a time- and donor-dependent reduction of viral titers by 1&#x02013;2 orders of magnitude if milk/virus was incubated for more than 2 h at 37 &#x000b0;C, suggesting that similar rates of ZIKV inactivation may also occur in the mother. Incubation at 22 &#x000b0;C for the same period of time had no effect on viral titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>b), perhaps because lipases or other enzymes involved in the generation of the antiviral factor are inactive at this temperature. We also analyzed how storage of ZIKV contaminated milk in the fridge (4 &#x000b0;C) or freezer (&#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C) affects viral titers. Interestingly, incubation at 4 &#x000b0;C for 2 days resulted in an entire loss of infectivity of the three ZIKV strains tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>c), with the exception of a small &#x0201c;blip&#x0201d; just above the detection limit observed for donor 5 at day 8 which disappeared again at day 10. These data confirm recent findings by Pfaender et al. showing effective inactivation of the African ZIKV strain MP-7051 and the Puerto Rican strain PRVABC59 in human breast milk under the same conditions [<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and might be explained by the &#x0201c;cooling activation&#x0201d; of the lipases as already discussed [<xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Surprisingly, the incubation of the samples at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C did not result in any loss of infectivity over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>d). This seems to be in contrast to the observations made above by mixing virus with milk that had been incubated before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>). At &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C the integrity of micelles is damaged and the BSSL activated, resulting in lipases getting in contact to a large amount of lipids upon thawing. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>c, long-term frozen milk inactivates ZIKV within 10&#x02013;30 min. When performing experiments with milk that had been frozen up to 10 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f005">Figure 5</xref>d) or long-term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), this was the time frame of incubation with ZIKV before inoculation of cells. In the spiking setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>), ~2&#x02013;3 log higher viral titers were mixed with milk, frozen for indicated time points, then thawed and immediately titrated and added to the cells, resulting in maximum concentrations of only 0.09% milk in cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>d). Thus, the low milk concentration and short incubation time at temperatures higher than &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C might not have been sufficient to inactivate high titers of ZIKV. In future studies it would be interesting to clarify whether the antiviral factor is generated at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C but exerts its antiviral activity at warmer temperatures. Such experiments might also help to confirm that the antiviral factor can be generated and be active at 4 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00591-f006">Figure 6</xref>c), and why this effect is not seen at 22 &#x000b0;C and only marginally at 37 &#x000b0;C. </p><p>Pfaender et al. have demonstrated that Holder pasteurization (62.5 &#x000b0;C for 30 min) of ZIKV-contaminated milk effectively destroys viral infectivity [<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although pasteurization is effective, it may not be applicable under resource-poor settings. Our results and those by Pfaender et al. show that storage of milk from ZIKV-infected mothers in the fridge for at least 2 days may in the majority of cases reduce or even eliminate risk of ZIKV transmission to the infant. Thus, storage of milk in the fridge might provide an interesting alternative to pasteurization. However, possible donor variations and the limited sample size tested preclude making generalized recommendations. </p><p>Recent reviews investigated transmission from ZIKV-infected mothers to their children and did not find evidence for efficient ZIKV transmission via breastfeeding, despite the presence of virus in breast milk [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and three reports of transmission [<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This is in line with the findings in a mouse model, where infectious ZIKV was detected in breast milk but did not result in transmission to pups [<xref rid="B61-viruses-11-00591" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The finding by others and us that ZIKV is inactivated in milk before and after feeding provides a plausible explanation for the rare event of transmission by breastfeeding.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank all the milk donors.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-viruses-11-00591"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/7/591/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/7/591/s1</uri>, Figure S1: The effect of freeze-stored breast milk on ZIKV infection.
