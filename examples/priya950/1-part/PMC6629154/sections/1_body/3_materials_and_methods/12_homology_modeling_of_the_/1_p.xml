<p>The transcription pre-initiation form and the apo form of the G1/1997 trimeric polymerase complex of the indicated G1/1997 mutants were modeled using published crystal structures of the influenza virus polymerase complexes (PDB: 4WSB and 5D98, respectively). MOE was used for software and most of the modeling conditions were described previously [
