<p>Several of the mutations identified in this study have been previously described in other AI viruses. PB2-E627K is the best characterized human-adaptation mutation in AI viruses, particularly H5N1 viruses [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and is readily acquired by H9N2 viruses during passage in mice [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. PB2-E627V has been recently shown to increase H5N1 virus replication in human cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, PB2-K526R is known to be linked to human adaptation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and has been found in human infections by Asian H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The K526R mutation has been occasionally found together with E627K and these two mutations have been shown to act cooperatively in mammalian adaptation in the H7N9 background [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. All AI viruses in birds in Asia retain 627E and 526K. In contrast, Middle Eastern avian H9N2 viruses have commonly accumulated both E627V and K526R during evolution of the G1-A/B reassortant, thereby increasing viral adaptation in birds and mammalian species. Also, the H5N1 clade 2.2.1 virus that is unique to Egypt has generally accumulated E627K in the field [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. An important question is what has driven the distinct evolutionary dynamics of the H9N2 and H5N1 viruses between the Middle East and Asia. It is possible that an early compensatory or enabling mutation(s) (e.g., A655V) in the Middle Eastern G1 lineage allowed the accumulation of adaptive mutations distinct from those observed in other avian influenza virus lineages. Selective pressure in the Middle East may differ from that in Asia. However, it is difficult to identify specific determinant(s) because multiple uncertainties have contributed to AI epidemics, including changes in environmental, behavioral, and social factors and changes in the poultry trade [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Also, the S543F mutation, but not the E543D mutation, was recently suggested to be linked to human adaption of H7N9 viruses by a prospective approach to deep mutational scanning [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A655V has not been previously described as an adaptation mutation in AI viruses, including H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 viruses.
