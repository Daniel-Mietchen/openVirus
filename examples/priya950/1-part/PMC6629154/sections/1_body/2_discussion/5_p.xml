<p>The exact mechanism of the effects of the PB2 mutations identified in this study remains unknown. These mutations clustered on the surface of the PB2 627 domain, which is a solvent-exposed region of the polymerase complex in both its transcription pre-initiation form and apo form. This suggested the possibility that the mutations may affect the interactions between the PB2-627 domain and host factor(s), such as the ANP32A proteins that have been shown to be involved in host species specificity mediated by the influenza virus PB2-627 domain [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is also possible that the mutations may not make direct contact with host factor(s), but may affect PB2 flexibility to enable other viral domains to promote interactions with host factor(s). In addition, in this study, the higher mortality and severe weight loss of mice infected with these influenza virus adaptation mutations was in agreement with our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showing higher polymerase activity and viral RNA synthesis and virus titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates. This indicated that increased replication fitness contributed to high influenza virus virulence in mice. However, several studies reported that influenza A virus polymerase can produce additional viral RNA products, often called aberrant RNAs, which trigger an innate immune response [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, there remains the possibility that the more active mutant polymerases may produce more of these aberrant RNAs, which may be partially associated with the higher virulence of the adaptive mutants in this study in infected mice.
