<p>Based on the effects of the reverse mutations in the EG/2013 background, we selected three PB2 mutations (i.e., E627V, E543D and K526R) for further study and introduced them as forward mutations into the ancestral G1/1997 background to assess their effects on polymerase activity. The E627V and K526R mutations significantly increased G1/1997 polymerase activity in human cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). But, the PB2-E543D mutation unexpectedly reduced the polymerase activity in human and avian cells, implying that PB2-E543D needed a compensatory mutation(s) that acted cooperatively in the G1/1997 background. Therefore, we modeled the G1/1997 polymerase complex structure (PDB: 4WSB as the modeling template) and searched for PB2 mutations that were structurally close to or related to the PB2-543 residue. Four mutations (i.e., S643T, A655V, T661A and T666I) were identified as putative compensatory mutations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, upper panel) and their cooperative effects with PB2-E543D were examined. As single mutations, all four had little effect on G1/1997 polymerase activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, lower panel): only A655V completely reversed the reduction caused by E543D. The E543D/A655V double mutation restored G1/1997 polymerase activity to a level comparable to G1/1997-wt, indicating that these mutations acted cooperatively on G1/1997 polymerase activity.
