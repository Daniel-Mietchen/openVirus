<p>In subsequent experiments, we introduced the E543D forward mutation together with the A655V compensatory mutation into the G1/1997 background. In addition, the D543E reverse mutation was introduced into the EG/2013 background, either singly or together with V655A: EG/2013 carried PB2-655V and, therefore, D543E did not necessarily require V655A in this background. In addition, the phylogenetically oldest G1-A strain (A/chicken/Saudi Arabia/532/1999) carried E627V, E543D and A655V (

Therefore, multiple forward mutations were combined in their putative phylogenetic order (i.e., E627V, E543D/A655V and K526R) and multiple reverse mutations were combined in their putative phylogenetic order [i.e., R526K, V627E and D543E(/V655A)].
