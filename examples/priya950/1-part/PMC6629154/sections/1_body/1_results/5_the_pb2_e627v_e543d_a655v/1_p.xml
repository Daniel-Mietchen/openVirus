<p>We investigated the effect of the amino acids at PB2 residues 627, 543, 655 and 526 on the replication kinetics of the G1-A/B reassortant using recombinant viruses in the EG/2013 background. DF-1 cells and human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells were infected with EG/2013-wt and the revertants and the replication kinetics of the viruses were compared. In both cell types, the revertants produced significantly lower progeny virus titers than EG/2013-wt (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The phylogenetically earliest revertant, R526K/V627E/D543E(/V655A), designated EG
 <sub>R526K/V627E/E543D(/V655A)</sub>, had the lowest progeny virus yield in both cell types by &gt; 3 logs in human cells at early times post-infection: EG/2013-wt &gt; R526K = V627E and D543E &gt; R526K/V627E &gt; R526K/V627E/D543E(/V655A).
