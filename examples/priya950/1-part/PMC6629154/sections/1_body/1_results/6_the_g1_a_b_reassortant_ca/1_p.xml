<p>To assess the relevance of the cooperative effects of the E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R mutation on 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> infections, BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with serial dilutions of two wild-type and four representative mutant strains; i.e., EG/2013-wt, G1(3P+NP)-wt, EG/2013
 <sub>V627E</sub>, EG/2013
 <sub>V627E/D543E/V655A/R526K</sub>, G1(3P+NP)
 <sub>E627V</sub> and G1(3P+NP)
 <sub>E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R</sub>. These viruses were categorized into three PB2 groups; i.e., ancestral genotype, G1(3P+NP)-wt and EG/2013
 <sub>V627E/D543E/V655A/R526K</sub>; intermediate genotype, G1(3P+NP)
 <sub>E627V</sub> and EG/2013
 <sub>V627E</sub>; and current genotype, G1(3P+NP)
 <sub>E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R</sub> and EG/2013-wt. The body weight and survival of each infected mouse was monitored.
