<p>To determine virus titers in the infected mice, groups of five mice were inoculated intranasally with 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU of each virus. Lungs and nasal turbinates were collected 3 d post-infection (dpi) and virus titers in the organs were measured by focus-forming assays. Virus titers in the infected mice were in agreement with their polymerase activity and replication kinetics in human cells

 <sub>E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R</sub> viruses replicated most efficiently in the lungs and nasal turbinates (

 <sub>V627E/D543E/V655A/R526K</sub> replicated with appreciably lower titers in the lungs, and showed clearly attenuated replication in the nasal turbinates: viruses were detected in only one of the five nasal turbinates of the infected mice. EG/2013

 <sub>E627V</sub> viruses showed intermediate replication in the mice.
