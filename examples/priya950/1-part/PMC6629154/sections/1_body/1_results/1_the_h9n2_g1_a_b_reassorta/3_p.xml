<p>Minigenome assays showed that the EG/2013 (H9N2) polymerase complex (PB2, PB1, PA and NP) had significantly higher polymerase activity in 293T cells than that of the three other AI viruses in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To determine which polymerase subunits contribute to the high polymerase activity of EG/2013, the polymerase activity of polymerase complexes composed of different combinations of the polymerase subunits of EG/2013 and ancestral G1/1997 were examined. A polymerase complex with G1/1997 PB2 in the EG/2013 background had a significant decrease in polymerase activity by &gt; 2 logs (

In contrast, G1/1997 PB1 and NP had little effect on EG/2013 polymerase activity. Also, polymerase complexes with PB2-flag were precipitated from the transfected cell lysates and the amount of PB1 and PA co-immunoprecipitated with PB2 was analyzed by western blotting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Similar amounts of PB1 and PA in these polymerase complexes were co-immunoprecipitated with PB2, verifying that reassortment did not affect trimeric complex formation. These results indicated that EG/2013 PB2 was a major determinant of the high EG/2013 polymerase activity in human cells.
