<p>In our previous study, we found that a representative strain of the G1-A/B reassortant, A/chicken/Egypt/CL42/2013 (H9N2) (referred to here as EG/2013), replicated at a high level in human cells and in mice. EG/2013 replication was higher than that of a H5N1 clade 2.2.1 strain carrying the representative human adaptation PB2-E627K mutation [
