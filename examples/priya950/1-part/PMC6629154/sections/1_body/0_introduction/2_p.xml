<p>H9N2 virus strains are classified in Eurasian and American lineages. The Eurasian lineage is divided into several clades, with the majority of strains classified in G1-like and Y280-like clades. G1-like clade viruses have mainly circulated in South China, Central Asia and the Middle East and are represented by the prototype A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997 virus. The G1-like clade in Central Asia and the Middle East has diversified further into four co-circulating subclades (designated A-D), with occasional intra-subclade reassortments [
