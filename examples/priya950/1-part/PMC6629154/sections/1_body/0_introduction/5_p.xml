<p>We previously reported that the H9N2 G1-A/B reassortant isolated in Egypt replicates to markedly high titers in human cells and in mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], indicating that the H9N2 virus may expand its host range to mammals. In this study, we investigated all phylogeny associated-mutations that have accumulated during H9N2 evolution in the Middle East and/or Central Asia, and the effect of these mutations on the biological properties of the H9N2 virus, including its adaptation to infect humans.
