  <title>Verification of strand specificity of the primers for viral NA vRNA, cRNA and mRNA.</title>
  <p>The strand specificity of the primers was verified using EG/2013 NA vRNA, cRNA and mRNA templates prepared by 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription as described in Materials and Methods. The specificity of primers for EG/2013 vRNA, cRNA and mRNA is shown with respect to the percent of the corresponding RNA template. Each data point is the mean Â± SD of three independent experiments. These data indicated that the qRT-PCR primers were highly specific for distinguishing viral vRNA, cRNA and mRNA, as previously reported [
