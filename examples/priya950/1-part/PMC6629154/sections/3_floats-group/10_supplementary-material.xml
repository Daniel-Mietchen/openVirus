  <title>Effects of single reverse mutations on EG/2013 polymerase activity in human cells at 37°C.</title>
  <p>Polymerase activity of EG/2013 and the PB2 revertants carrying single mutations was measured in human 293T cells at 37°C. The viruses were either not carrying PB2-V627E (A) or were carrying PB2-V627E (B). The data are expressed relative to the results for EG/2013-627V (wt) (A) and EG/2013-V627E (B). Colors of the vertical bars indicate the four mutation categories based on the time periods when the mutations were identified, as shown in
