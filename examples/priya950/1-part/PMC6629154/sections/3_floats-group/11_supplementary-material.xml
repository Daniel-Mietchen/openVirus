  <title>Expression of the PB2 mutants in this study in human cells.</title>
  <p>Human 293T cells were transfected with PB2 expression plasmids carrying the indicated mutations and either not carrying V627E (A and B) or carrying V627E (C and D). At 16 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and analyzed by western blotting using anti-PB2 antibody. Representative images are shown. (A and C). After quantification of the band intensities, the amount of expression of each PB2 construct was calculated relative to that for EG/2013-627V (wt). Each data point is the mean Â± SD of five independent experiments. (B and D) Representative results of western blotting for EG/2013-627V (wt), the PB2 mutants and the reference EG/2013-G1/PB2. NS indicates no statistically significant difference.</p>
