  <title>Effect of PB2 mutations on RNA synthesis from RNPs reconstituted in human and avian cells.</title>
  <p>Viral RNA synthesis was assayed by vRNA-oriented and cRNA-oriented NA RNP reconstitution assays in 293T cells at 33°C (A-F) and in DF-1 cells at 37°C (G-L). At 24 h post-transfection, the viral RNAs were extracted and the levels of vRNA (A, D, G and J), mRNA (B, E, H and K) and cRNA (C, F, I and L) were quantified by strand-specific real-time RT-PCR. (A-C and G-I) Viral RNA levels from G1/1997 RNPs with PB2 forward mutations. The data are expressed relative to the results for G1/1997-wt. (D-F and J-L) Viral RNA levels from EG/2013 RNPs with PB2 reverse mutations. The data are expressed relative to the results for EG/2013-wt. Each data point is the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.</p>
