  <title>Cooperative effects of the E543D and A655V mutations on G1 replication kinetics in avian and human cells.</title>
  <p>Avian DF-1 cells (A) and human Calu-3 cells (B and C) were infected with G1(3P+NP) virus and PB2 mutants carrying E543D alone or in combination with the indicated mutations at an MOI of 0.005 and 0.001, respectively, and incubated at 37°C (A and B) or 33°C (C). Virus titers at the indicated times post-infection were determined by FFU assays. Each data point is the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. The data indicated that the E543E/A655V double mutation, but not the E543 single mutation, produced efficient G1 replication in avian and human cells, in agreement with the minigenome assay data in
