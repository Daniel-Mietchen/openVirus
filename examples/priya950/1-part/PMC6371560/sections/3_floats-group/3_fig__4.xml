  <p>H7N9 virus transmission routes. H7N9 virus maintain in poultry reservoirs in farms and backyard. During transportation, virus transmits among the large group of live poultries through direct and/or indirect contact. Arriving at LPMs, immunological naive population exposes to infected poultries and/or H7N9 virus aerosol. Risk groups get affected. Contaminated cages and other staffs may transfer H7N9 virus reversely to farms and backyards and form an infection loop. Frequent clean and disinfect after each workday could cut down the loop</p>
