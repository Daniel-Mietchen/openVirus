  <p>H7N9 virus origin and its development. 
   <bold>a</bold> illustrates the current H7N9 epidemic. Sequencing analyses revealed that the human infections with H7N9 virus came from three avian origins, with six internal genes from avian influenza A (H9N2) viruses in domestic poultries, the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from AI H7N3 in domestic ducks and the neuraminidase (NA) gene mutate from AI H7N9 in migrating birds reservoir [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. After they recombined and mutated into the novel LPAI H7N9 virus that can infect poultry with little to no disease in poultry, it came into the human-animal interface and then gained the power to cross the species barrier. Causing four epidemic waves in human and poultry, the H7N9 transmit wider in the chicken reservoir, adding the opportunities to mutate and recombine. With genetic mutation, H7N9 virus amplify among both poultry and human population in the five wave.
