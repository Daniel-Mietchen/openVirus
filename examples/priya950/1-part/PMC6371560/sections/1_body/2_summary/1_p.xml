<p id="Par30">Since 2018, through the concerted efforts of the disease control department and the agricultural sector, the number of human cases of H7N9 avian influenza virus infection has fallen sharply. This is a clear example of the importance of a One Health strategy in combating zoonosis. To better control H7N9 influenza virus and prevent the emergence of novel influenza virus strains, we advocate establishing coordination and cooperation among local governments, veterinarians, disease control and market management departments. This will ensure that we are able to effectively meet the constant challenge of emerging infectious diseases.</p>
