<p id="Par25">The prevention and control of H7N9 influenza virus infections represents an important case-study in One Health. During the first few waves of the epidemic, there was no consolidated, multidisciplinary response and the outbreak continued unabated. However, the number of human H7N9 virus infections were successfully controlled when all the relevant stakeholders were able to collaborate and form a united response. New zoonotic influenza A viruses like the H7N9 virus will continue to emerge from the human-animal interface. Therefore, we propose the following four ways to strengthen the cooperation between agricultural departments and public health departments in the context of zoonotic disease outbreaks.

   <p id="Par26">The early deployment of multi-sectoral joint prevention and control mechanisms is essential in the early detection and control of epidemics. The agricultural sector and the disease control department need to conduct instant information interchanges and adopt joint monitoring and disposal measures. Establishing and improving animal transportation and supervision mechanisms, such as animal border inspection and quarantine stations in provinces and major cities, will also help to avoid the ongoing spread of the disease [

   <p id="Par27">Strengthened biosecurity (i.e. segregation, cleaning and disinfection) in both farms and LPMs. This could include establishing biosecurity isolation zones to prevent the spread of new avian viruses via the contact of poultry and wild birds. The government should further focus on standardizing the poultry industry and enhancing farming support. This could include promoting industrial transformation and improving cold chain transportation systems. After early detection of live poultry infections, culling, disinfection, isolation and other virus purification measures must be carried out immediately [

   <p id="Par28">Continued active monitoring of the wild bird reservoirs and intensified virus tracing. Diagnostic teams in the veterinary system should use high-throughput viral sequencing to continually monitor and analyze the diversity of DNA/RNA viruses at the human-animal interface. These technologies will extend the scope of virus surveillance, identify potential emerging infectious diseases and improve early warning capabilities. Establishing such a rapid virus monitoring and reporting system will facilitate more efficient source control of the disease.</p>

   <p id="Par29">Develop new influenza virus vaccines and antiviral drugs and prioritize their distribution. This approach should include prioritizing vaccination of exposed animal workers and domestic animals. This requires us to move from the current passive monitoring system in hospitals to the ‘front line’. Stopping and monitoring the infection of those at occupational risk of exposure is essential in protecting the general population.</p>
