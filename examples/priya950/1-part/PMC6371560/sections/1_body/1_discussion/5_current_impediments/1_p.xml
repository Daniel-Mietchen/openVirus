<p id="Par22">China plays a vital role in the international poultry trade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, 30% of the poultry raised in China are raised in backyard conditions without any biosecurity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This widespread use of backyard farms makes it challenging for the MoA to conduct routine avian diseases surveillance. Furthermore, the unique trade model used in China, “Company + peasant household”, creates opportunities for H7N9 influenza viruses to transmit from poultry farms to wholesale markets, where different genotypes avian influenza viruses can reassort. There is also a risk of reverse virus transmission from LPMs to farms [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, because the rate of positive serology samples is much higher in LPMs than farms, agricultural departments may neglect this dual transmission pattern, resulting in continued infections [
