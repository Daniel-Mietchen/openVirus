<p id="Par17">Since February 2013, six waves of human H7N9 influenza virus infections have occurred in China. The total number of human infections has varied dramatically between waves, ranging from 134 cases in the first wave to 781 cases in the fifth wave. Only 3 cases have been reported since October 2017 to present day (i.e during the sixth wave). Like other influenza virus strains, the H7N9 influenza virus showed increased circulation amongst both poultry and humans in winter and spring months, in particular from December to April. In China, more than half of the reported cases have been concentrated in Zhejiang (310), Guangdong (258) and Jiangsu (251) provinces [

The first stage was characterized by sporadic human infections with the virus (waves one to four of the epidemic). However, since October 2017, once the virus became established in poultry populations across China, the number of human H7N9 influenza virus cases surged. This second stage was associated with a reduction in the mean patient age, suggesting that a larger proportion of the population was at risk [
