<p>ZIKV-induced malformations require serious attention and consideration because core information about its pathogenicity and mechanism of action is either obscure or evolving (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The purpose of this review article is to comprehend if ZIKV can potentially cause microcephaly. For this purpose, we comprehensively accessed and characterized current literature to discuss about the widespread epidemic of ZIKV, pathology of ZIKV related microcephaly, recent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental studies to understand the mechanism of ZIKV infection, ambiguities in previously published data and ZIKV future implications, its control strategies and hints of advance research to affirm this probationary link.
