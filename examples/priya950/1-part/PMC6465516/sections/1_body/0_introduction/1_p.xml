<p>The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, single-stranded RNA, flavivirus that is closely related to yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DENV). It can adapt to harsh conditions and temperature as high as 40°C (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). ZIKV natural transmission cycle mainly involves the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species (
 <italic>A. furcifer, A. luteocephalus, A. africanus, and A. taylori</italic>), sylvatic cycle (monkeys) and occasional human hosts (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In human population it is potentially transmitted via sex (heterosexual or homosexual transmission) (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), blood transfusion (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), from mother to fetus and through direct contact (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The most common laboratory tests for Zika virus confirmation constitute both RNA and antibody detection in plasma, urine, amniotic fluid, conception products, autopsy and placental tissue (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), cerebrospinal fluid, semen, saliva and breast milk, which confirm the above-mentioned routes of transmission (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Based on lack of standardized diagnostic test facilities, non-elimination of other confounding factors and ambiguities in previously reported data (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), the ZIKV association with microcephaly was considered ambiguous. However, the World Health Organization situation report based on observational, cohort and case-control studies claimed a strong scientific consensus that ZIKV infection is cause of microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and other congenital neurological disorders (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A recent Lancet report has also presented genuine facts that ZIKV infection is the cause of congenital microcephaly (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).
