<p>Garcez et al. (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) used human-induced pluripotent stem cells to investigate the ZIKV infection consequences on brain development in the first trimester with advance 3D culture models. The results illustrated that ZIKV can potentially cause death of human neural stem cells by declining the growth of brain organoids and neutrospheres. Qian et al. produced viral infections in a forebrain-specific organoid model derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, which resulted in microcephaly like symptoms, such as increased cell death, decline in cellular proliferation, and neuronal cell volume (
