<p>Researchers have successfully conducted experiments to investigate the ZIKV pathogenesis and its affinity for neurons and neural stem cells by using cellular models such as neural cell precursors (neurospheres), brain organoids, advance embryonic stem cell (ESC), induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) (
