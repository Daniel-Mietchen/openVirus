<p>Since the exposure of ZIKV and its confirmation as a potential cause of microcephaly, there are few limitations reported in the studies, as discussed in detail by Wu et al. (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). There was a broad range of time interval (average, 13 weeks) since fetal microcephaly was first diagnosed, and maternal clinical symptoms appeared. In Brazil, the ZIKV epidemic could predict profound increase in the number of microcephaly cases, almost 5â€“10 months later. During this time maternal laboratory tests for ZIKV confirmation could be done in order to exclude any confounder as a nonspecific cause of microcephaly. Whereas, due to lack of official case by case reporting and a few numbers of laboratory confirmed cases, it is inappropriate to predict the total expected number of microcephaly cases in Brazil and in the rest of the Americas (
