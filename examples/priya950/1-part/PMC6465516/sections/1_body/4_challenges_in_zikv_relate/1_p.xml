<p>Despite the evidences supporting ZIKV association with microcephaly and neonatal/fetal brain congenital abnormalities, scientists from different backgrounds suggest that clinical symptoms of microcephaly are shared by various other congenital infections (e.g., cytomegalovirus), and arboviruses that can potentially cause microcephaly (

Furthermore, approximately 80% of ZIKV infected patients either had no symptoms or symptoms similar to that of DENV and CHIKV that were co-circulating during ZIKV outbreak in Brazil. Only 44% of reported cases were confirmed, while the remaining cases were considered normal, showing a degree of over-reporting (

In certain Brazilian states, an analysis has estimated that 1st trimester of pregnancy has the highest risk of laboratory-confirmed ZIKV transmission and microcephaly as compared to 2nd and 3rd trimesters that have been linked with fetal death, defects in intrauterine growth, or abnormalities in prenatal imaging that needs to be confirmed postnatally as the pregnancies are still ongoing (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The retrospective study conducted by Cauchemez et al. estimated 1% risk of microcephaly to the fetuses/neonates, as discussed earlier, has provided crucial information about ZIKV, microcephaly, and brain anomalies (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, this study has drawbacks, such as estimation of risk based on small number of cases, wide confidence interval, and lack of control for other confounders (
