<p>Brasil et al. claimed a positive association of ZIKV with microcephaly, i.e., 4/42 cases among the exposure group vs. 0/16 among the non-exposure group, without ZIKV laboratory confirmation and laboratory exclusion tests (

If ZIKV is encountered as a first flavivirus the chances of cross-reactivity decreases; the result will be opposite if ZIKV causes a secondary flavivirus infection, because serological test results will be positive for DENV. If a population infected with ZIKV has a background immunity for DENV or any other flavivirus, DENV cross-reactivity IgM assay may lead to false results and misdiagnosed cases of ZIKV (
