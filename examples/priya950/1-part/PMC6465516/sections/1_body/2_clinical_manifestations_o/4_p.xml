<p>The fetus brain postmortem report by Mlakar et al. (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) indicated the presence of flavivirus-like particles (viral RNA load, 6.5 Ã— 10
 <sup>7</sup> copies per mg), hydrocephalus, several microscopic malformations, focal inflammation, calcifications, displacement of cortex, and HC below then second percentile. While phylogenetic analysis has revealed the highest resemblance ratio (99.7%) with French Polynesia, Sao Paolo, Brazil, Cambodia, and Micronesia ZIKV strain (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Similarly, cerebral examination of two microcephalic neonates and two e autopsies exposed multiple pathologic findings, such as, microglial nodules, gliosis, cellular degeneration, parenchymal calcifications, and necrosis. Here all reported mothers were symptomatic for ZIKV infection during the first trimesters of their pregnancy and RT-PCR gave positive results for ZIKV RNA in the brain and placental tissue samples (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The ZIKV intrauterine infection cases during third trimester, were also found associated with reduction in brain parenchymal volume and corpus callosum development (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In another fetal case report, HC declined from 47th to 24th percentile without microcephaly and intracranial calcifications (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The infant's cerebrospinal fluid sample analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) gave positive Ig-M antibody result, while occurrence of white -matter dysmyelination and cortical hypogyration was claimed to be caused by ZIKV infection as it attenuates the brain development (
