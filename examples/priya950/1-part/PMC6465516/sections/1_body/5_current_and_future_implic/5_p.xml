<p>At present no commercial test to diagnose Zika virus infection. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is performed to detect ZIKV RNA in the laboratory. Antiviral immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies of ZIKV that appears at the end of the first week of onset of illness can be detected from the blood by either plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) or IgM enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cross reaction of ZIKV with other Flaviviruses can be eliminated by using PRNT (
