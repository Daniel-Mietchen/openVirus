<p>The populations should be well informed about the neurological malformations risks, especially in the regions where existence of Zika virus, its vectors or local transmission is suspected (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Adequate counseling of ZIKV infected pregnant women and those preparing for pregnancy are advised to protect themselves from bites of mosquitos, avoid traveling to epidemic regions (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and take precautions if their partners have returned from epidemic regions, or delay their pregnancies (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Control and prevention strategies for ZIKV infection should also include increased use of insect repellent and other interventions to decrease the abundance of potent mosquito vectors (

Epidemic countries or countries at higher risk should do a proper check up and go through follow-up cohorts and calculate potential risk of microcephaly throughout women pregnancy, along with proper investigation of materno-fetal transmission through experimental studies (
