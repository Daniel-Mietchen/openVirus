<p>Nanotechnology is used for the diagnosis of Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) infections; multiplexed assay on a plasmonic-gold (pGOLD) platform was developed for the exact measurement of IgG, IgA antibodies and IgG avidity in the blood serum of the patients. These antibodies (IgA and IgG) are more specific against NS1 antigen of ZIKV infection in comparison to IgM cross reactivity method (
