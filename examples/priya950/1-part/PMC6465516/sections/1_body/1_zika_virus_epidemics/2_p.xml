<p>During the Zika virus pandemic in the French Polynesia, an unexpected rise in the number of autoimmune and neurological complications was observed. Almost 66% (95% CI 62–70) of the general population developed infection and more than 31,000 patients consulted physicians due to suspected infection (

From 2014-15, Brazil reported multiple cases of illness and skin rash to the World Health Organization (WHO), occurring in the Brazilian states Pernambuco, Maranha~o, Rio Grande do Norte and Bahia. In these states (February to April 2015), around 7,000 skin rash cases were reported but no identification tests were performed as ZIKV infection was not suspected (

It caused a 20-fold increase in the microcephaly cases in Brazil, whereas, around 1,248 new suspected cases were observed, a prevalence of 99·7/100,000 live births. The WHO issued an epidemiological alert about the relationship of ZIKV infection with neurological syndromes and congenital microcephaly, after confirmation by Brazilian Ministry of Health (

Only half of the reported cases were further confirmed by the presence of calcification, other brain malformations, or both (

According to routine birth reports, an average of 163 (5.6 per 100,000 live birth) cases of microcephaly occurred annually before 2015 ZIKA epidemic in Brazil, while 3,530 (121.7 per 100,000 live births) suspected cases of microcephaly were reported in 2015, including 46 death cases (
