<p>Almost ten years later, another example of an encoded viral selenoprotein was reported in fowlpox viral genome [
 <xref rid="B176-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>], see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-02101-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D. This was due to the increasing number of viral genome sequenced but also to the development of novel bioinformatic tools dedicated to the discovery of selenoprotein genes in newly sequenced genomes [
 <xref rid="B79-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In this viral genome, a coding region homolog to the mammalian GPX4 gene was found, with an in-frame UGA codon, and a predicted SECIS element downstream of the UGA codon but this time within the open reading frame instead of being in the 3â€™UTR. This finding represented a great opportunity to investigate whether this putative viral SECIS or a canonical SECIS could function within the open reading frame. The authors demonstrated that mammalian cell lines supported the expression of selenoproteins with in-frame SECIS element from both viral and mammalian origin. This fowlpox SECIS element was the second example of a functional viral SECIS element with a structure being identical to the mammalian SECIS. Interestingly, in an evolutionary related virus, the canarypox virus (CPV), this gene has evolved in a Cys-containing GPX4 with a fossil SECIS element still present in the coding region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-02101-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D). The potential of this fossil SECIS to trigger recoding of an UGA codon in selenocysteine has not been investigated. It appears that there was a recent mutation of the selenocysteine into cysteine codon in canarypox virus, as it has happened multiple times during evolution of the selenoproteomes in

 <italic>Bacteria</italic> and

 <xref rid="B80-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Note that cysteine is encoded by UGC and UGU codons, and that a single mutation is able to change a selenocysteine to cysteine codon and vice-versa. The presence of a fossil SECIS element indicates that the GPX4 selenoprotein gene was first acquired from the host and recently converted to the Cys form.
