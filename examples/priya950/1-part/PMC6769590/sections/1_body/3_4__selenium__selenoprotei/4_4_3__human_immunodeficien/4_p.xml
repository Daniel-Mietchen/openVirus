<p>The nutritional deficiencies of the HIV-infected patient can affect the responsive capacity of the immune system and the progression to AIDS. Selenium is nowadays understood as an essential micronutrient for antioxidant defense and also immune function [

 <xref rid="B132-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. HIV infection simultaneously increases the demand for micronutrients and causes their loss which leads to a deficiency that can be compensated by micronutrient supplementation [

 <xref rid="B135-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Low selenium levels are associated with a lower number of CD4 T-cells, faster progression of AIDS, and 20% increase in the risk of death [

However, little has been done in term of intervention studies by selenium supplementation or at the cellular and molecular levels to establish the link between selenium, selenoprotein and HIV infection. For example, selenium supplementation is only effective in slowing HIV progression for a subgroup of patients, for which serum selenium levels, CD4 count and viral load were improving in contrast to selenium non-responders or placebo group [

 <xref rid="B139-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. However, the cellular and molecular mechanism for this unequal response remains elusive. Although efficient at controlling viral load and restoring immune function, HIV antiretroviral therapies, especially the protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors, have been shown to induce oxidative stress [
