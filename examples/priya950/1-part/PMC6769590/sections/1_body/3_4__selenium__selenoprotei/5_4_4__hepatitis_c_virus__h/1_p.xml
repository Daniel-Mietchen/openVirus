<p>The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped, linear, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (Groupe IV), genus 
 <italic>Hepacivirus</italic>. Nowadays, about 3% of the world’s population is infected with HCV, which represents approximately 170 million people. Although HCV replication occurs in hepatocytes, the virus also propagates in immune cells. In 80% of the patients with acute hepatitis C, the disease evolves to chronic hepatitis, with 2% developing liver cirrhosis and 1–5% developing liver cancer [

The genome of around 9600 nucleotides encodes a unique polyprotein which is co- and post-translationally cleaved into 10 structural and non-structural proteins.
