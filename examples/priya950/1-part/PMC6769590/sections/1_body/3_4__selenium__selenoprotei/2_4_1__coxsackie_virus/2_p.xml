<p>In the early 1930s an endemic cardiomyopathy termed Keshan disease was first described in Heilongjiang province, Northeast China. This disease mainly affects infants, children and women in childbearing age [
 <xref rid="B66-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It is characterized by cardiac enlargement, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema and death. Keshan disease spread in another 12 provinces across China between the 1940s and 1960s. Approximately eight million people lived in the affected areas during that period of time, and thousands of people died of Keshan disease every year from this pathology. It is only in the 1970s and even the early 1980s, that the selenium contents in soil, water, food, and human body fluids were found extremely deficient in the areas affected by Keshan disease as compared with adjacent provinces [

However, several features of the Keshan disease, especially the annual or seasonal fluctuation in the incidence of the disease, did not wholly fit with a selenium deficiency. It appears that this disease has a dual etiology, i.e., selenium deficiency and an infectious cofactor, namely the coxsackie virus B [
