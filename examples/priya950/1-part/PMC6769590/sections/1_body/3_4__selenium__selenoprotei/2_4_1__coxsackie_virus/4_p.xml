<p>These experiments performed in animal models demonstrate that the host nutritional status, and particularly its antioxidant defense system is an important virulence factor, which can greatly contribute to the evolution of benign viral genomes into more virulent viruses. However, the molecular mechanism involved in this process remains to be elucidated.</p>
