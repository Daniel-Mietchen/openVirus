<p>Various subtypes of the most common influenza A viruses are classified based on the diversity in the structure of HA and NA proteins. Influenza viruses can be divided into 16 different HA and NA combinations. Influenza A and B viruses cause epidemics, whereas influenza C virus tends to cause infections with less severe symptoms [

People at highest risk for mortality are the elderly and individuals with chronic diseases of the lung and heart. However, safe and effective vaccines are available but often do not perfectly match the circulating subtypes or become ineffective due to viral antigenic drift [
