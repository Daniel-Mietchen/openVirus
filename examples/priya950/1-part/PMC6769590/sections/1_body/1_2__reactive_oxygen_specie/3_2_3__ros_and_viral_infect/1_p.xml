 <sub>2</sub>O

 <italic>in vivo</italic> during viral infection [

 <xref rid="B63-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The latter can be caused directly by virus and/or by the inflammatory response of the host. The viral TAT protein increases intracellular ROS levels by inhibiting the antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase MnSOD [

 <xref rid="B57-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The increase of ROS production has been well documented during HIV, HBV, HCV, EBV, HSV-1, VSV, RSV, HTLV-1 and Influenza viral infections [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. With HIV-1, ROS were found to stimulate viral replication with the nuclear transcription factor NF-kB, which is necessary for viral replication, being activated by oxidative stress
