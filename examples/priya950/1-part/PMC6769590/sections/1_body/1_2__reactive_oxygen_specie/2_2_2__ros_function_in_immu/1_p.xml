<p>ROS have an important role in host defense and immunity [
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The most characterized example is the mechanism by which phagocytic cells produce large amounts of ROS to eliminate a wide variety of pathogens without altering the host cell viability. The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase enzyme complex of phagocytic cells (PHOX) produces superoxide anion radical in the phagocytic vacuole via the transfer of one electron from NADPH to molecular oxygen [

 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>•−</sup>) molecule dismutates to form H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and other ROS by further chemical or enzymatic reactions [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> into HOCl. While the mechanism by which ROS can neutralize the invading micro-organisms in the phagosome is still a matter of debate, the production of HOCl by MPO seems to have a predominant role [
