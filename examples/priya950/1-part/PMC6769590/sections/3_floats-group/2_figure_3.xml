A non-virulent stain of CVB3 (referred to as CVB3/0, and shown in blue) does not lead to myocarditis in this animal model, although replicating in the mice heart fed with adequate selenium diet (left column). In case of selenium deficient mice, a group of animals was fed with a selenium-deficient diet for four weeks before infection with the benign strain CVB3/0 (second column from the left). A control group of animals was fed with an adequate-selenium diet and infected in parallel [
   <xref rid="B98-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In case of selenium-deficient mice, they developed severe myocarditis. The sequencing of the CVB3 viral genome isolated from the heart of selenium-deficient mice showed mutations at nucleotide positions known to co-vary with cardio-virulence of CVB3 strains (shown in yellow). In comparison, the sequence of CVB3 isolated from selenium adequate mice showed no genetic variation (first column). To determine the consequences of the genetic alterations of the virus, CVB3 isolated from selenium deficient mice was inoculated in animals fed with a selenium-adequate diet (third column from the left) [
   <xref rid="B98-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. This experiment confirmed that the mutations of the viral genome increased the cardio-virulence of the virus, which can now induce severe myocarditis even in selenium adequate mice. To investigate whether the most abundant selenoprotein, GPX1, which expression correlates with selenium intake, is involved in the virulence of CVB3, a similar study was performed with

   <xref rid="B108-nutrients-11-02101" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. These mice, infected with the benign strain CVB3/0, developed myocarditis and nucleotide mutations of the viral genome isolated from their heart, similarly to selenium deficient mice.
