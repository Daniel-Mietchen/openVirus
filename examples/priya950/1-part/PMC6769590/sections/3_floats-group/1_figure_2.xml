 <caption>
  <p>Enzymatic activities of the two most important families of selenoproteins involved in antioxidant defense in mammalian cells: the glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and the thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD). (
   <bold>A</bold>) GPXs use two molecules of reduced glutathione (GSH) to reduce hydrogen peroxides and organic hydroperoxides (ROOH) in their respective alcohols (ROH). The various peroxide substrates of mammalian GPXs are listed next to the bracket; (
   <bold>B</bold>) TXNRDs use NADPH to catalyze the reduction of thioredoxins and therefore participate in many cellular functions but can also reduce other sulfur or selenium containing compounds. Ox, oxidized molecule; Red, reduced molecule.
