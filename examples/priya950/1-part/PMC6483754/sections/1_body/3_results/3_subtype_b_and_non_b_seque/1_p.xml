<p>Of the 203 NCC non-B sequences, 57 (28.1%) were directly linked to other NCC sequences and 45 (22.2%) were clustered with 1 or more LANL sequences including 41 directly linked to an LANL sequence. Of these 41 sequences, 33 (80.5%) were directly linked to a sequence in 1 or more non-US countries. The proportions of NCC sequences directly linked to LANL sequences was not significantly different between subtype B and non-B sequences (17.2% vs 20.2%;
