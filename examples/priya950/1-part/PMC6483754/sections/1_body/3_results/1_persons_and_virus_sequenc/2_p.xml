<p>Subtype B accounted for 95.5% of HIV-1 isolates from NCC members (n = 4350). The remaining 4.5% (n = 203) belonged to a non-B subtype: C (n = 55), CRF01_AE (n = 52), CRF02_AG (n = 24), A (n = 15) and other miscellaneous subtypes, circulating and unique recombinant forms (n = 57). There was a statistically significant increase in non-B sequences prevalence from 1.8% between 1998 and 2003 to 5.5% between 2011 and 2016 (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03â€“1.10).</p>
