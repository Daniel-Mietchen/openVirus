<p>The 326 clusters with 3 or more sequences were further categorized into broad geographic classes: 223 (68.4%) local clusters (&gt;60% of cluster members were from NCC), 50 (15.3%) national clusters (&gt;50% of cluster members were from the United States, but not from NCC), and 33 (10.1%) international (&gt;50% of cluster members were from outside the United States). Twenty (6.13%) clusters with 3 or more sequences did not belong to 1 of the 3 classes. The 1151 NCC sequences clustering with an LANL sequence were significantly more likely than the 3402 that did not cluster to be from persons who were male (94.4% vs 89.3%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), younger (median 38 vs 40 years; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .002), MSM (74.7% vs 68.3%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and intravenous drug users (6.8% vs 3.5%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Within the clusters containing 3 or more sequences, NCC persons in the international clusters were more likely to be older (median, 41 vs 34 years; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), white (53.8% vs 43.5%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and female (8.3% vs 4.8%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and less likely to be MSM (71.2% vs 78.5%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) compared with those in local and national clusters.
