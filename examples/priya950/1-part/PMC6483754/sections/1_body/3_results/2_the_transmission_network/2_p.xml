<p>The distribution of TN93 distances for edges connecting NCC sequences to one another (median, 0.85%; IQR, 0.50%–1.19%) was significantly lower than the distribution of distances for edges connecting NCC and LANL sequences (median, 1.35%; IQR, 1.19%–1.44%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, 2-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The median difference in sample years between linked NCC and LANL sequences was 2 years (IQR, 1–4) for sequence pairs with a TN93 distance up to 0.5%, 4 years (IQR, 2–7) for sequence pairs with a genetic distance between 0.5% and 1.0%, and 6 years (IQR, 3–14) for sequence pairs with a genetic distance greater 1.0% (
