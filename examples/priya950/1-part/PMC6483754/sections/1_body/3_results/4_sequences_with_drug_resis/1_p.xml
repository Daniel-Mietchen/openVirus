<p>In 27 (10.2%) of the 264 NCC-LANL clusters, 42 NCC sequences shared 1 or more established DRMs with a linked LANL sequence; 11 of these sequences shared 2 or more DRMs between the NCC and LANL sequences. Eighteen sequences had shared nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance, 17 had shared nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance, 4 had shared protease inhibitor (PI) resistance, and 3 had shared dual NRTI/PI resistance. Forty of the 42 sequences with shared DRMs were from the United States and 2 were from Europe; 40 comprised subtype B viruses. The most common shared mutations within these sequences were the NRTI-resistance mutations T215D/E/S/C/V (18 sequences) and M41L (11 sequences); the NNRTI-resistance mutations K103N (12 sequences) and Y188L (3 sequences); and the PI-resistance mutations L90M (4 sequences) and I54V (3 sequences).</p>
