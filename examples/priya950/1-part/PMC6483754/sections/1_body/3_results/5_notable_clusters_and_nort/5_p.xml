<p>The third largest non-B cluster included 1404 subtype A6 sequences including 4 NCC sequences, 250 LANL sequences directly linked to 1 of these 4 sequences, and 1150 additional LANL sequences [

Bayesian estimates of cluster tMRCA were sensitive to the model of population size dynamics and showed wide CIs (1939; HPD, 1901â€“1969). Our analyses included many sequences outside the FSU, hence its results are not directly comparable to previous, FSU-focused, estimates. No significant evidence of onward transmission was found within the NCC (
