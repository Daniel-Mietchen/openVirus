<p>The largest non-B cluster contained 3123 CRF01_AE sequences including 13 NCC sequences, 58 LANL sequences directly linked to 1 of these 13 sequences, and 3052 additional LANL sequences. Most of the sequences in this cluster were from China, Vietnam, Thailand, or Japan. Two subclades involving 3 NCC lineages each provide evidence of at least 2 separate ongoing transmission chains within the NCC, originating in 2003 (HPD: 2001–2006) and 2006 (HPD: 2004–2009) (
