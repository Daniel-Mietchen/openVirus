<p>The second largest subtype B cluster contained 1492 sequences including 2 NCC sequences and 1490 LANL sequences, 1471 of which were from Japan. This cluster contained sequences closely related to the previously reported JP.MSM.B-1 strain, which accounts for one third of infections in Japanese MSM [
