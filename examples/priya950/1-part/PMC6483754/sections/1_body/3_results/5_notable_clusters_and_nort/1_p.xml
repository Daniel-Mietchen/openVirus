<p>The largest subtype B cluster contained 3502 sequences including 512 NCC sequences and 2990 LANL sequences from 45 countries, including 1868 from outside the United States. Seven of the US sequences were isolated in 1978 and 1979, suggesting that this cluster originated from the founding viruses of the US subtype B epidemic [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Twenty-five NCC sequences shared a TN93 genetic distance â‰¤1.5% with 1 of the 7 1978/1979 US subtype B founder viruses. This cluster represents a lineage that originated in Haiti and the United States and then spread widely to many countries in Europe, Asia, and South America [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which explains its designation as an international cluster. The overall mean distance between sequence pairs in this cluster was 3.5% with the maximum distance between sequence pairs of 9.4%. The large size of the cluster likely results from chaining caused by the dense sampling of viruses belonging to this lineage since the earliest of these strains were identified 35 years ago.
