<p>We used a 2-tiered TN93 distance cutoff to define a link (edge) between 2 sequences (nodes): a 1.5% threshold for linking NCC sequences to other NCC sequences and to LANL sequences [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and a more stringent 1.0% to bring in LANL sequences that connect only to other LANL sequences [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The NCC transmission network contained clusters having 2 or more NCC sequences. The NCC-LANL transmission network contained clusters having 1 or more NCC sequences linked to 1 or more LANL sequences.
