<p>The HIV-TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (HIV-TRACE) was used to infer a molecular transmission network designed to identify NCC sequences genetically similar to sequences in the LANL dataset [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The NCC and LANL sequences were aligned to a reference PR and RT sequence (HXB2; GenBank accession no.

Tamura-Nei (TN93) pairwise nucleotide genetic distances were calculated between each pair of sequences in the combined datasets, and sequence pairs with TN93 distances â‰¤2% were recorded for subsequent analyses [

Ambiguous nucleotides were handled as described previously by resolving 2-way ambiguities (RYMSWK) to maximize matches, averaging all other ambiguities, and averaging all ambiguities in sequences that contained 5% or more of ambiguous nucleotide positions [
