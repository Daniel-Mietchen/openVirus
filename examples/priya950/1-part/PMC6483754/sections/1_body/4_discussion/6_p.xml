<p>As the number of sequences in transmission network analyses have risen, it has become increasingly common to first identify clusters using a rapid distance-based approach and to then use phylogenetic analysis to study individual clusters [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Because of how HIV-TRACE defines clusters, adding more sequences to the sample set can create new clusters, merge existing clusters, or add sequences to existing clusters. In contrast, clusters that are defined phylogenetically may disappear entirely with the addition of more sequence data, because, for example, the bootstrap support for subtending branches is degraded [
