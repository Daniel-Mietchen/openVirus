<p>Standard practice in molecular epidemiology inference is to consider only sequences from a local or regional epidemic or to include a small subset of preselected reference sequences [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. By expanding our analysis to all previously published sequences, we analyzed our local epidemic within the context of the global HIV-1 pandemic. Twenty-five percent of 4553 NCC sequences were in a cluster with 1 or more previously published sequences, and more than two thirds of these (17.4% of the total) had a direct link, defined as genetic distance â‰¤1.5%, to 1 or more previously published sequences. Approximately one half of these linked sequences (8.0% of the total) were linked to 1 or more non-US sequences.
