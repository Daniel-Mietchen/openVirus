<p>Despite a statistically significant positive correlation between the genetic distance between sequences and the length of time separating their isolation dates, there were many exceptions to this trend. Indeed, even sequences that differ from one another by ≤0.5% were often obtained several years apart, demonstrating that the presence of highly similar sequences between a pair of individuals should not be interpreted as evidence for direct transmission. Hypotheses about direct transmission make sense only when sequence analysis is combined with contact tracing [
