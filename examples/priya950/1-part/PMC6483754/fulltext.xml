In the years since the epidemic was recognized, the subtype B HIV-1 lineage that initiated the US epidemic spread to many other countries [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Concurrently, non-subtype-B variants gradually increased in prevalence in the United States [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref>] and other predominantly subtype-B countries [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref>]. By the early 1980s, large numbers of persons suffering from HIV-related illnesses were reported from the New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, and San Francisco metropolitan areas. These regions, frequent destinations for both immigration and travel, were points of origin for the global spread of the subtype B viruses.</p><p>Recent advances in high-throughput molecular epidemiology analysis revealed international links to regional HIV-1 epidemics [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this study, we use a large collection of HIV-1 <italic>pol</italic> sequences in a Northern Californian cohort sampled over 2 decades, and we published <italic>pol</italic> sequences from other parts of the United States and from outside of the United States to quantify the degree and nature of national and international links in this cohort.</p><sec sec-type="materials" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Persons and Virus Sequences</title><p>We analyzed protease (PR) and reverse-transcriptase (RT) sequences from a cohort of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive persons from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program-Northern California (KPNC) undergoing genotypic resistance testing at Stanford University between 1998 and 2016 (Northern California cohort [NCC]). The KPNC is estimated to provide care to approximately 30% of the insured population in Northern California. Genotypic resistance testing for ART-naive individuals became routine in 2003 [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Protease and reverse-transcriptase nucleotide sequences from 4553 individuals in the Northern California cohort are available in GenBank and the accession numbers are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Files</xref>.</p><p>We searched the Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL) HIV Sequence Database, which contains all published HIV-1 sequences, to identify sequences encompassing PR and at least the first 200 amino acids of RT (HXB2 nucleotides 2253&#x02013;3151) [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. When more than 1 sequence from an individual is available, the representative sequence was selected at random per LANL protocols. When more than 1 sequence was available for persons in the NCC, we selected the earliest sequence. All LANL sequences from individuals also in the NCC were excluded from the LANL dataset. Sequences annotated as problematic by LANL were also excluded: synthetic sequences and those with high non-ACTG content, hypermutation, and potential contamination [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The LANL reference dataset, generated July 1, 2018, included 139 060 HIV-1 group M sequences.

The NCC sequences were subtyped using the COMET program [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The NCC sequences were also annotated with age, gender, race, and HIV acquisition risk factor.

The NCC and LANL sequences were aligned to a reference PR and RT sequence (HXB2; GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="K03455">K03455</ext-link>) using the codon-aware program <italic>bealign</italic> (BioExt package, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/veg/BioExt">https://github.com/veg/BioExt</ext-link>).

Ambiguous nucleotides were handled as described previously by resolving 2-way ambiguities (RYMSWK) to maximize matches, averaging all other ambiguities, and averaging all ambiguities in sequences that contained 5% or more of ambiguous nucleotide positions [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A phylogenetic test of conditional independence was used to remove some spurious transitive connections that result in cycles of transmission using an edge filtering method (described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p><p>We used a 2-tiered TN93 distance cutoff to define a link (edge) between 2 sequences (nodes): a 1.5% threshold for linking NCC sequences to other NCC sequences and to LANL sequences [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and a more stringent 1.0% to bring in LANL sequences that connect only to other LANL sequences [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Eighteen sequences had shared nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance, 17 had shared nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance, 4 had shared protease inhibitor (PI) resistance, and 3 had shared dual NRTI/PI resistance. Forty of the 42 sequences with shared DRMs were from the United States and 2 were from Europe; 40 comprised subtype B viruses. The most common shared mutations within these sequences were the NRTI-resistance mutations T215D/E/S/C/V (18 sequences) and M41L (11 sequences); the NNRTI-resistance mutations K103N (12 sequences) and Y188L (3 sequences); and the PI-resistance mutations L90M (4 sequences) and I54V (3 sequences).</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Notable Clusters and Northern California Cohort-Associated Transmission Events</title><p>The largest subtype B cluster contained 3502 sequences including 512 NCC sequences and 2990 LANL sequences from 45 countries, including 1868 from outside the United States. Seven of the US sequences were isolated in 1978 and 1979, suggesting that this cluster originated from the founding viruses of the US subtype B epidemic [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Twenty-five NCC sequences shared a TN93 genetic distance &#x02264;1.5% with 1 of the 7 1978/1979 US subtype B founder viruses. This cluster represents a lineage that originated in Haiti and the United States and then spread widely to many countries in Europe, Asia, and South America [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which explains its designation as an international cluster. The overall mean distance between sequence pairs in this cluster was 3.5% with the maximum distance between sequence pairs of 9.4%. The large size of the cluster likely results from chaining caused by the dense sampling of viruses belonging to this lineage since the earliest of these strains were identified 35 years ago.</p><p>The second largest subtype B cluster contained 1492 sequences including 2 NCC sequences and 1490 LANL sequences, 1471 of which were from Japan.

The recent origin of this cluster (1990; HPD, 1984&#x02013;1995) is consistent with previous descriptions of this subtype as a rapidly growing population [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. There is no evidence for ongoing transmission of these viruses in the NCC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>The third largest non-B cluster included 1404 subtype A6 sequences including 4 NCC sequences, 250 LANL sequences directly linked to 1 of these 4 sequences, and 1150 additional LANL sequences [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Most of these sequences were from countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU) (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Molecular dating of this cluster using relaxed clock methods proved difficult. Bayesian estimates of cluster tMRCA were sensitive to the model of population size dynamics and showed wide CIs (1939; HPD, 1901&#x02013;1969). Our analyses included many sequences outside the FSU, hence its results are not directly comparable to previous, FSU-focused, estimates. No significant evidence of onward transmission was found within the NCC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Several additional examples of how the inclusion of published sequences provides insight into transmission dynamics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>. For example, a cluster of just 2 CRF24_BG NCC sequences was expanded to a cluster of 33 sequences involving 2 additional countries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7A</xref>). Two NCC subtype C sequences that were disconnected in the NCC-only network became hubs in a cluster of 50 sequences from 7 additional countries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref>). A cluster of 2 NCC subtype B sequences and an unconnected subtype B NCC sequence were linked to a cluster of LANL isolates from the United States and Canada (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7C</xref>), and a cluster of 4 NCC sequences was augmented with a LANL US isolate and bridged to an older cluster of LANL sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s11"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Standard practice in molecular epidemiology inference is to consider only sequences from a local or regional epidemic or to include a small subset of preselected reference sequences [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. By expanding our analysis to all previously published sequences, we analyzed our local epidemic within the context of the global HIV-1 pandemic. Twenty-five percent of 4553 NCC sequences were in a cluster with 1 or more previously published sequences, and more than two thirds of these (17.4% of the total) had a direct link, defined as genetic distance &#x02264;1.5%, to 1 or more previously published sequences. Approximately one half of these linked sequences (8.0% of the total) were linked to 1 or more non-US sequences.</p><p>Subtype B accounted for 95.5% of the NCC sequences. The largest subtype B cluster contained many NCC sequences consistent with the fact that this lineage traces its origin to the United States [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although most of the other large subtype B clusters were dominated by US sequences, the second largest subtype B cluster, which contained 2 NCC sequences, traced its origin to Japan.</p><p>Non-B subtypes accounted for 4.5% of the NCC sequences, and, unsurprisingly, these were more likely to cluster with a non-US sequence. The CRF07_BC cluster, which originated in East Asia, contained 3 NCC sequences, each of which appeared to represent a separate NCC introduction. The subtype A6 cluster, which originated in countries of the former Soviet Union, contained 4 NCC sequences, each of which also appeared to represent separate NCC introductions. In contrast, the largest CRF01_AE cluster, which was dominated by sequences from East and Southeast Asia, contained 13 NCC sequences, including 2 lineages, each containing 3 sequences, consistent with instances of ongoing local transmission. Although 2 of the 3 NCC individuals in the CRF07_BC cluster and 8 of the 13 NCC individuals in the largest CRF01_AE cluster were of Asian ethnicity, the countries of origin of NCC individuals were not available. The absence of data on country of origin is a limitation of our study that makes it impossible to distinguish between immigration and local dissemination as a cause of non-subtype B diversity in our cohort.</p><p>Approximately 1% of NCC sequences shared 1 or more established DRMs with a previously published sequence. The vast majority were subtype B sequences from other persons in the United States, consistent with the high prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in the United States. However, the proportion of NCC TDR sequences linked to TDR sequences outside of the NCC was much lower than the 37% of NCC TDR sequences previously reported to link to 1 or more other NCC TDR sequences [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Despite a statistically significant positive correlation between the genetic distance between sequences and the length of time separating their isolation dates, there were many exceptions to this trend. Indeed, even sequences that differ from one another by &#x02264;0.5% were often obtained several years apart, demonstrating that the presence of highly similar sequences between a pair of individuals should not be interpreted as evidence for direct transmission. Hypotheses about direct transmission make sense only when sequence analysis is combined with contact tracing [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32&#x02013;34</xref>].</p><p>As the number of sequences in transmission network analyses have risen, it has become increasingly common to first identify clusters using a rapid distance-based approach and to then use phylogenetic analysis to study individual clusters [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Because of how HIV-TRACE defines clusters, adding more sequences to the sample set can create new clusters, merge existing clusters, or add sequences to existing clusters. In contrast, clusters that are defined phylogenetically may disappear entirely with the addition of more sequence data, because, for example, the bootstrap support for subtending branches is degraded [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Including the totality of publicly available sequences in our analysis had several measurable and important benefits. First, by comparing NCC with previously published sequences, an additional 429 NCC sequences (9.4% of the total) were brought into the network, increasing the total number of clustered NCC sequences to 2391 or 52.5% of the total. This rate is similar to the rate of 52.3% reported for a smaller and intensively sampled cohort from San Diego [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and it is notably higher than the rate of 32% reported from US national surveillance data [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, the placement of individual sequences in the clusters was altered by the inclusion of previously published sequences, with NCC sequences becoming peripheral both in the large non-subtype B clusters displaying patterns of exponential growth and in many of the smaller clusters. Because HIV transmission dynamics can be strongly influenced by central nodes in transmission networks (and that there are relatively few of them), being able to more accurately identify such nodes is also important [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, the NCC epidemic is dominated by subtype B viruses linked primarily to other NCC sequences. However, the largest subtype B cluster, which retained links to the earliest North American subtype B strains, contained large numbers of links to persons in other parts of the United States, Asia, and Europe. Several sequences belonged to well characterized international clusters responsible for rapidly expanding regional epidemics. However, despite their rapid regional spread, these viruses do not appear to have made significant inroads into the NCC, suggesting that HIV-1 transmission is influenced more by human behavioral factors than intrinsic viral factors. Continued monitoring of local epidemics in the context of global sequences will advance a better understanding the past, present, and potentially future courses of regional epidemics and support public health measures to optimally target prevention efforts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s13"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
