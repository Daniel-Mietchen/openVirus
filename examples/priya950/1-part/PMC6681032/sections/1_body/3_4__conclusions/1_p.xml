<p>Thus, we developed EdAP, a new 4′-ethynyl-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-monophosphate analog, as a potent influenza A inhibitor with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.8 μM. EdAP was designed based on the results of the anti-influenza activities of several 4′-ethynyl-adenosine derivatives. The obtained observations could provide helpful information for developing new anti-influenza nucleosides.
