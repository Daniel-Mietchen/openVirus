 <italic>tert</italic>-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) protection of β-methylene alcohol in 
 <bold>6</bold> generated alcohol 
 <bold>7</bold> in a 67% yield. The (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) oxidation of alcohol 
 <bold>7</bold> and the subsequent treatment of the resulting aldehyde 
 <bold>8</bold> with tetrabromomethane and triphenylphosphine generated dibromoolefine 
 <bold>9</bold> in a 96% yield over two steps [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-02603" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Dibromoolefine 
 <bold>9</bold> was treated with 
 <italic>n</italic>-BuLi, followed by chlorotriethylsilane(TESCl), to provide chlorotriethylsilane (TES)-protected alkyne 
 <bold>10</bold> in an 83% yield. The treatment of the resulting acetal 
 <bold>10</bold> with AcOH generated hemiacetal 
 <bold>11</bold>, which was acetylated with Ac
 <sub>2</sub>O to afford diacetate 
 <bold>12</bold> as a diastereomeric mixture of the acetoxy group in an 84% yield. The one-pot Silyl–Hilbert–Johnson reaction between adenine and acetate 
 <bold>12</bold> furnished the desired adenosine derivative 
 <bold>13</bold> in a 73% yield [

 <bold>13</bold>, the resulting alcohol 
 <bold>14</bold> was converted to phenylthiocarbonate 
 <bold>15</bold> in a 63% yield, which was treated with Bu
 <sub>3</sub>SnH and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) to generate deoxy adenosine derivative

 <sub>2</sub> aq, followed by the deprotection of the 
 <italic>p</italic>-Methoxybenzyl (PMB) group by cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN), afforded EdAP (
