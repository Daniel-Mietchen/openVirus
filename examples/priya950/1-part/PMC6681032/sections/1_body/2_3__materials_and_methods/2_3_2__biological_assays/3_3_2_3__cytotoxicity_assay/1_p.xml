 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-02603" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], each inhibitor was serially diluted in serum-free MEM and transferred onto confluent monolayers of MDCK–SIAT1. After incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h, the viable cell number was determined with a cell counting kit-8 from DOJINDO Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan.
