<p>After two washes with MEM, MDCK–SIAT1 cells were preincubated with an inhibitor at various concentrations in MEM at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 1 h. Influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.03 was pretreated with the same inhibitor at the same concentrations in MEM with 2 μg/mL acetylated trypsin at 4 °C for 1 h. The inhibitor-containing MEM medium on the cells was replaced with the influenza virus-inhibitor mixture. After incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 19–20 h, the medium was removed. Immediately, the infected cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol. After two washes, the permeabilized cells were stained with primary antiviral NP mouse antibody (4E6) and secondary β-galactosidase-conjugated antimouse IgG antibody. The number of influenza virus-produced nucleoproteins (NPs) in the permeabilized cells in each well was determined by a galactosidase-based fluorescent assay, as previously described [

A percentage of the fluorescent intensity of each well relative to the fluorescent intensity of the no-inhibitor control well that contained only the virus was used to express the number of influenza virus-produced NPs in each well. Then, a graph was generated by plotting the percentage of relative numbers of influenza virus-produced NPs against the logarithm of the inhibitor concentrations. After fitting the points on the graph through Prism’s nonlinear regression analysis, the inhibitor concentration that inhibited virus multiplication by 50% in comparison to the control (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was obtained. The influenza virus-produced NPs in the permeabilized cells in each well were visualized as a blue color by a peroxidase-based chromogenic assay [
