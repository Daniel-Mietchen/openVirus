<p>A solution of acetonide 
 <bold>10</bold> (16.5 g, 24 mmol) in AcOH (240 mL) and H
 <sub>2</sub>O (60 mL) was stirred for 5 h at 65 °C. Concentration of the reaction mixture with toluene gave crude hemiacetal 
 <bold>11</bold>, which was directly used in the next step without further purification. A solution of the above crude hemiacetal 
 <bold>11</bold> in pyridine (60 mL) and Ac
 <sub>2</sub>O (20 mL) was stirred for 10 h at rt. After concentration of the reaction mixture with toluene, the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to afford acetal
