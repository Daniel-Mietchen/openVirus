 <italic>n</italic>-BuLi (4.2 mL, 2.76 M in hexane) was added. After stirring for 1 h at −30 °C, chlorotriethylsilane (5 mL, 30 mmol) was added at −78 °C. After stirring for 2 h at −78 °C, the reaction was quenched with H
 <sub>2</sub>O at 0 °C. The resulting mixture was extracted with EtOAc, and the combined organic layer was washed with H
