<p>Unless otherwise indicated, all the reactions were performed in oven-dried glassware fitted with a 3-way glass stopcock under an argon atmosphere and stirred with Teflon-coated magnetic stir bars. All work-up and purification procedures were performed with reagent-grade solvents under an ambient atmosphere. CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> was distilled from P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> immediately before use. Et
 <sub>2</sub>O and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were distilled from sodium/benzophenone immediately before use. Et
 <sub>3</sub>N and 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-diisopropylethylamine (DIEPA) were distilled from CaH
 <sub>2</sub> and stored over KOH. CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN and toluene were distilled from CaH
 <sub>2</sub> and stored over molecular sieves 4A. Chemical regents were of commercial grade and were used without any purification unless otherwise noted. Flash chromatography was performed on a PSQ-100B (Fuji Silysia Co., Ltd., Aichi, Japan) unless otherwise noted. Analysis thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using commercial silica gel plates (TLC Silica Gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub>, Merck Millipore, Massachusetts, United States). Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded on a Jasco FT/IR-410 spectrometer using NaCl (neat). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained from an Applied Biosystems mass spectrometer (APIQSTAR pulsar I) for electrospray ionization (ESI). Polyethylene glycol was used as the internal standard. HRMS data are reported as 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> (relative intensity), with an accurate mass reported for the molecular ion [M + Na]
 <sup>+</sup>. 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (Avance DRX-600) with CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> or MeOD as a solvent. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as an internal standard (Î´ 0.0) for 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR. Chemical shifts for 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR were reported in ppm relative to the center line of a triplet at 77.0 ppm in CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> or a septet at 49.0 ppm in MeOD as a solvent. Multiplicities are indicated as br (broad), s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), or m (multiplet). Coupling constants (
 <italic>J</italic>) are reported in hertz (Hz). The diastereomeric ratio was determined by 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR analysis. Optical rotations were determined using a JASCO P-1010 digital polarimeter in 100-mm cells and with a sodium D line (589 nm) at room temperature in the solvent and concentration indicated.
