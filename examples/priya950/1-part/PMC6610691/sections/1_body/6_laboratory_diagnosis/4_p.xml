<p id="p0140">Samples such as urine and saliva have been used to detect flaviviruses, including ZIKV and WNV. This sample collection is non-invasive and may improve tests for routine surveillance and research involving infants and young children 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Further, ZIKV RNA has been detected in urine at higher levels and for an extended period time, up to 36 days after disease onset
