 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> reviewed some of the potential pathways for WNV entry into the CNS, including direct infection of the vascular endothelium; viral passage through the vascular endothelium due to disruption of blood–brain barrier integrity by vasoactive cytokines; and a Trojan horse mechanism, whereby infected monocytes are trafficked into the CNS.
