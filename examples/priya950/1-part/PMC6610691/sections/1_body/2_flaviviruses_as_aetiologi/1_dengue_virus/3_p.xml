 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) reported seven cases where DENV RNA was found in CSF samples from children with meningoencephalitis tested during the 2014/2015 epidemic in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. A previous study (2010–2013) using samples from 70 children from the same hospital detected DENV by PCR or CSF serology in 11.7% of cases 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A study of 209 suspected viral meningitis/meningoencephalitis patients in Ceará State from 2005–2008 found three children positive for DENV in CSF by serological tests

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and Espírito Santo 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> analysed samples from individuals with suspected DENV infection. The study carried out in Rio de Janeiro involved 13 IgM-seropositive patients who exhibited neurological manifestations during the course of their infections. One of these patients was an 11-year-old girl with a diagnosis of encephalitis and positive serum IgM
