  <p>Generation of reporter influenza A subtype H3N2 virus by fusing 
   <italic>Gluc</italic> gene to NS segment. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Engineering of Gluc reporter gene in the genome of influenza A NY (H3N2) virus. The porcine teschovirusâ€“1 2A (PTV-1 2A) site allows reporter virus A/NY-Gluc to express both NS1-Gluc and NEP proteins from a single mRNA. SD/SA: Splice donor/acceptor sites. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were infected with WT NY or with NY-Gluc from serial passage experiments in MDCK cells (passages 0 to 2) at a MOI of 0.01. At 60 h post-infection (p.i.) luciferase assays were performed.
