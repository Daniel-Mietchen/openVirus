  <p>Generation of reporter influenza A subtype H3N2 virus by using segment PR8/NS-Gluc, which expresses NS1-Gluc chimeric protein. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Diagram of reassorment for generating reporter A/NY-r18-Gluc virus. (
   <bold>b</bold>) MDCK cells were infected with NY-r18-Gluc virus from serial passage experiments in MDCK cells (passages 0 to 5) at a MOI of 0.01. At 60 h p.i. luciferase assays were performed. (
   <bold>c</bold>) MDCK cells were mock-infected or infected with NY virus and NY-r18-Gluc virus of indicated passages respectively at a MOI of 1. Cytopathic effects were observed at 60 h p.i. using Olympus inverted phase contrast microscope IX73 (magnification 200Ã—). Arrows indicate the multinucleated syncytia induced by NY-r18-Gluc infection.
