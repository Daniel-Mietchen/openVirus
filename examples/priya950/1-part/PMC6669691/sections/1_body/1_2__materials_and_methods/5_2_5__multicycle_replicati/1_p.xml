<p>A multicycle replication assay was performed to compare the replication properties of the indicated viruses in vitro. Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded into 24-well plates 1 day before inoculation with the indicated viruses at a MOI of 0.01. After incubation at 37 Â°C for 1 h, the cells were washed, followed by addition of fresh medium. At various time points, aliquots were removed for determination of Gluc activity and viral titers.</p>
