<p>As described previously, wild-type A/NY (H3N2) was generated by using the reverse genetics system with indicated rescue plasmids [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00665" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Briefly, eight pDZ plasmids (0.5 Î¼g each) representing the eight segments of the IAV genome were transfected into 293T/MDCK cocultures using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After 48 h the virus was harvested from the supernatant.
