<p>MDCK cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with NY-r19-Gluc virus at a MOI of 0.1. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed, and fresh Opti-MEM containing 2 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin was added. For antiviral determination, indicated concentrations of TBHQ or arbidol were present all through the process. At around 72 h post-infection (p.i.), aliquots were removed for the luciferase assay.</p>
