<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00665-f005">Figure 5</xref>, NY-r19-Gluc virus was sensitive to both TBHQ and arbidol, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.4 μM and 0.9 μM, respectively. In contrast, PR8-Gluc virus, which possesses a group-1 HA, was inhibited by arbidol but not by TBHQ. These results indicate that the NY-r19-Gluc virus can be used to evaluate IAV antivirals.
