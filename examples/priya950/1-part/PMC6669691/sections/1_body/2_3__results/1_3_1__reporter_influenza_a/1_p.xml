<p>Previously, a reporter influenza A subtype H1N1 virus PR8-Gluc was successfully generated by fusing a Gluc gene to the NS1 open reading frame [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00665-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). However, as the recombinant virus was passaged in MDCK cells, the expression level of the reporter Gluc decreased rapidly, and only negligible Gluc was detectable after two passages (
