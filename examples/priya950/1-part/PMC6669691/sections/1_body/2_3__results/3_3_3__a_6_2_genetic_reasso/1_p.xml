<p>X-31, which is a 6:2 genetic reassortant encoding the HA and NA genes of A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) in a backbone comprising the six internal genes of PR8, is often used in studies requiring an IAV H3N2 subtype [

A similar strategy was explored here, and a reassortant virus NY-r19 encoding HA and NA of the NY virus in the backbone of PR8 was successfully rescued by reverse genetics. In parallel, we further generated a reporter virus NY-r19-Gluc containing HA and NA of the NY virus in the backbone of PR8 where a reporter Gluc gene was fused to NS1 (
