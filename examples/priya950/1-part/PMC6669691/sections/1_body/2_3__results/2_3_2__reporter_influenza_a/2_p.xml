<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00665-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, a reassortant virus containing PR8 NS-Gluc segment derived from a recombinant virus PR8-Gluc and the other seven segments of wildtype NY virus was successfully rescued using reverse genetics. The virus was designated as NY-r18-Gluc. Unlike the NY-Gluc virus, the NY-r18-Gluc virus could express Gluc protein at a high level, and no obvious decrease of Gluc expression was observed after serial passage of the viruses, suggesting that the reporter Gluc gene is functionally maintained (
