<p>A second strategy using the PR8 NS gene instead of that of the NY virus to express NS1-Gluc chimeric protein was also explored in this study, and a reporter influenza A subtype H3N2 virus NY-r18-Gluc was successfully rescued. This reporter virus can express a high level of Gluc protein, and the reporter gene is adequately maintained upon passaging in MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00665-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). However, we observed a change in CPE in the MDCK cells infected with NY-r18-Gluc virus after passage 4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00665-f002">Figure 2</xref>c). It is likely that the mutations in the genome of the recombinant virus occurred during the passages, and the mutations are likely residues within the HA gene, since the CPE alteration includes syncytia formation, which is mediated by HA. Thus, this recombinant virus may have limited utility as a research tool.
