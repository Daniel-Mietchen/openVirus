<p>The usefulness of the NY-r19-Gluc virus as a tool to evaluate subtype-specific HA inhibitors was validated with TBHQ, an inhibitor specifically targeting group-2 HAs, and arbidol, a broad-spectrum HA inhibitor [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00665" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The luciferase assay clearly demonstrated that the NY-r19-Gluc virus is sensitive to both TBHQ and arbidol, with IC
