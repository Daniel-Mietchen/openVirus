  <p>ZIKA virus induces Hsp70 protein expression. Huh7.5 cells were infected with 3 MOI ZIKV and Hsp70 assayed by western blot at 6, 12, 24 and 48â€…h post-infection. Hsp70 and Hsp60 bands were quantitated using ImageJ software to calculate relative Hsp70 levels. Successful virus infection in cells was determined by detection of ZIKA E protein in the cell lysate. Hsp60 was assayed as a housekeeping control.</p>
