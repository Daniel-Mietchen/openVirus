  <p>Interaction of Hsp70 and viral RNA. (A) Colocalization of intracellular Hsp70 and viral RNA. ZIKA virus infected Huh7.5 cells were fixed at 12-h post-infection. Cells were stained for dsRNA (green) and Hsp70 (red). Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Yellow dots indicate co-localized dsRNA and Hsp70. IC = ZIKV infected cell. UC = ZIKV uninfected cell. (B) Relative quantitation of ZIKA virus capsid mRNA by real-time RT-PCR in the presence of MKT077. Cells were infected with 6 MOI of ZIKV in the presence of MKT077. The 
   <italic>Y</italic>-axis represents the expression fold-change of viral capsid mRNA normalized to vehicle (DMSO) control. Treatments with different letters are statistically different (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).
