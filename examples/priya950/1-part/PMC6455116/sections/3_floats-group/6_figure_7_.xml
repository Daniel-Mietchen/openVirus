  <p>Role of Hsp70 in ZIKV release step. Titres of intra- and extra-cellular virus production in the presence or absence of MKT077 are shown. Following pre-treatment with 0.5, 1, and 5 µM MKT077, Huh7.5 cells were infected with ZIKV (0.1 MOI. Free virus (supernatants) and cell-associated viruses were collected 48-h post-infection. Infectious viral titres were determined by plaque assay. Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals. 
   <italic>N</italic> = 6 per data point. Error bars denote standard error of the mean. Virus production was significantly different from between intracellular vs. extracellular compartments (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), as well as MKT007 concentration (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). There was a significant interaction term (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) noted by the crossing of the lines at 0.5 µM MKT007.
