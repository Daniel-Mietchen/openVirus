  <p>Hsp70 inhibitor MKT077 inhibits infectious ZIKV production. Huh7.5 cells were infected with 0.1 MOI of ZIKV. For the pre-treatment group, Huh7.5 cells were treated with 0.5, 1, and 5 µM MKT077 for 2 h and washed with DMEM before infection with ZIKV. For the post-treatment group, cells were infected with ZIKV, washed, and replenished with medium containing MKT077. Culture supernatants were collected 48 h post-infection. Virus titres in the culture supernatants were analysed by plaque assay. 
   <italic>N</italic> = 6 per data point. Error bars denote standard error of the mean.
