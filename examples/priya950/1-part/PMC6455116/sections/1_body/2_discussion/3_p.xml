<p>Our experiments indicate that Hsp70 is involved in ZIKV binding and entry into mammalian cells, highlighting its important role in the early stages of virus infection. We detected the presence of Hsp70 on the cell surface of both monkey and human cells where it could interact with infecting viral particles. Antibody blocking of cell surface-localized Hsp70 or pre-incubation of ZIKV with recombinant Hsp70 significantly reduced ZIKV infection. Specifically, reduction in the viral plaque forming units suggests that initial viral infection was inhibited, consistent with the hypothesis that Hsp70 is one cellular factor acting as a cell surface receptor for ZIKV attachment and invasion.</p>
