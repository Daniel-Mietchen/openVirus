<p>Western blots: Monolayers of cells were harvested by a cell scraper and pelleted by centrifugation. Cell pellets were washed twice with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C and subjected to 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE), after which proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad) that were blocked for 60 min at room temperature in 1XTBST buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) containing 5% non-fat milk powder. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody (anti-Hsp60 or anti-Hsp70 at 1:1000; anti-EGFP or anti-EGFP at 1:500) primary antibodies. The next day, blots were washed 5 times with 1XTBST and incubated with the corresponding detection antibody (1:2000) in 1XTBST containing 1% milk solution at room temperature for 1 h. Signals were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (GE healthcare) or AP-based colorimetric kit (BioRad).</p>
