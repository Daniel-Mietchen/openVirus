<p>Cell heat shock assay: Confluent cell monolayers were grown in 12 well plates and incubated at 44°C for 20 min or at 37°C (negative control). At 10 h post heat shock, cells were infected with ZIKV at an MOI of 0.1. Culture supernatants were harvested 48 h post-infection and titrated for infectious ZIKV by plaque assay.</p>
