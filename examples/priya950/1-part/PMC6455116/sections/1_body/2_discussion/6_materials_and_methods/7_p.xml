<p>For Hsp60 and Hsp70 quantitation, blots were scanned and band intensities quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The background was first subtracted from the gel image, the intensity of the Hsp70 band and Hsp60 control band quantified for each sample by measuring the area under the intensity curve, and the value of Hsp70 divided by the value for Hsp60. Quotients for each sample were normalized to hour 0 for heat treatment or untreated values to calculate protein induction. Uncropped blots are included as Figure S3.</p>
