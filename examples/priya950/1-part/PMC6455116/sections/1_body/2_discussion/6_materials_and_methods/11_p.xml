<p>Competition assay: To block virus surface ligands, 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV were incubated with 1000 ng recombinant human Hsp70 (rhHsp70) protein (Enzo Life Science) or BSA (control) for 90 min on ice. Huh7.5 cells were infected with ZIKV preparations at an MOI of 1 at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 1 h, after which cells were washed three times with DMEM. Fresh medium was added to infected cells which were then incubated at 48 h at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. As described above, infectious ZIKV particles in the culture supernatant were determined by plaque assay.
