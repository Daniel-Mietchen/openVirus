<p>MTT assay: To determine cell cytotoxicity, the colorimetric MTT assay (Biovision Inc, USA) was used. Metabolically active, viable cells convert MTT into formazan, a water-insoluble product; however, dead cells lose this ability. Huh7.5 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) were cultured in a 96-well plate at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and exposed to varying concentrations of MKT077 for 24 h. Cells treated with medium only served as the control group. After removing the supernatant of each well and washing twice by PBS, 20 µl of MTT reagent (5 mg/ml) and 100 µl of medium were introduced. Following incubation for another 3.5 h, the resultant formazan crystals were dissolved in MTT solvent (100 µl) and the absorbance intensity measured by a microplate reader at 600 nm. All experiments were performed in triplicates, and relative cell viability was expressed as a percentage relative to the untreated control cells.
