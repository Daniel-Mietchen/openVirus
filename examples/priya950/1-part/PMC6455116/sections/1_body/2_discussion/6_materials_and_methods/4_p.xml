<p>Plaque assays: Vero cells (5×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were grown to a confluent monolayer in 6 well plates and infected with serial dilutions of ZIKV-infected culture supernatant. Incubation was carried out for 2 hours at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, after which monolayers were rinsed with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Monolayers were overlaid with maintenance medium containing 0.6% molten agarose and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 3 days. At the end of incubation period, secondary overlay media (primary overlay media along with 1% neutral red) was poured and incubated at 37°C overnight with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The next day plaques were counted.
