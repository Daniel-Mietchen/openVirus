<p>Hsp70 overexpression: HEK 293 T cells grown in 24-well tissue culture plates were transfected with 2 µg of EGFP-Hsp70 vector plasmid (Addgene plasmid no 15215) or EGFP the only plasmid using Lipofectamine LTX reagent. At 40-h post-transfection, the culture medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh DMEM containing 0.1 MOI of the virus and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. At 48-h post-infection culture supernatants and cells were harvested. The culture supernatants were titrated for ZIKV by the focus-forming assay. The cell pellets were used to assess the expression of EGFP-Hsp70 and EGFP by the Western blot assay as described above.
