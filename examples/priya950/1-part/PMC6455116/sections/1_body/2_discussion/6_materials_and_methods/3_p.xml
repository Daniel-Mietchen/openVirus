<p>Immunolocalization of Hsp70: Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to elucidate the distribution of Hsp70 on mammalian cells. Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 2-well chamber slide and grown at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and processed for Hsp70 staining. The antibodies used for immunofluorescence included rabbit anti-Hsp70 (1:500) and Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. CellMask Deep Red Plasma Membrane stain (C10046, Thermofisher) was used for plasma membrane staining. Cells were examined using an Olympus Fluoview 10i-LIV confocal microscope, and images processed using ImageJ software.
