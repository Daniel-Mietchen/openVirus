<p>Until recently, ZIKV was not considered a serious public health threat, and thus its biology has not been studied in great detail. Hsp’s have been found to be critical factors for the pathogenesis of many viruses [

 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28–31</xref>]. Here, we have shown that Hsp70 is involved in multiple steps of the ZIKV life cycle ranging from cell entry to replication and virus egress, highlighting its essential role in virus infection.
