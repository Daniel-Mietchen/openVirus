<p>Due to the involvement of Hsp70 in the infection processes of multiple viruses, it has been suggested that this protein may be a potential molecular target for antiviral therapies [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In particular, the association between Hsp70 and ZIKV suggests a critical role for this interaction during the viral infection process. Our data suggest that Hsp70 is one of several critical factors mediating the initial entry and post-entry replication and egress of ZIKV. As there is currently no effective therapy or vaccine for ZIKV infection, novel therapies to reduce infection and severe clinical outcomes, particularly for pregnant women and developing fetuses, are of extreme importance. The multiple critical roles of Hsp70 in the infectious life cycle of ZIKV validate Hsp70 as a potential target for future anti-ZIKV therapies.
