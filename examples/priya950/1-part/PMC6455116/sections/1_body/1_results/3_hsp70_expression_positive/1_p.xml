<p>We next induced expression of Hsp70 protein in Huh7.5 cells by heat shock or in HEK 293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) by transient overexpression using an EGFP-Hsp70 expression plasmid, infected the cells with ZIKV, and measured the production of infectious ZIKV titre in the culture supernatant 48 h after infection. Upon heat shock, Hsp70 protein levels were induced more than 3-fold at 10-h post-heat treatment compared with non-heat treated control cells (Figure S2A). For overexpressing transfected cells, we first verified that cells were expressing EGFP-Hsp70 or EGFP (control) by western blot (Figure S2). Cells were infected with ZIKV 40 h post-transfection and culture supernatants tested for virus titre at 48 h post-infection. In both heat-treated and EGFP-Hsp70 overexpressed cells, infectious ZIKV titre was significantly elevated compared to non-induced or EGFP control overexpressed cells, respectively (
