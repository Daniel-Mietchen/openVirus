<p>Interaction between Hsp70 and viral RNA: We used confocal microscopy to detect the viral replication complex in infected cells using an antibody specific for dsRNA (a viral replication intermediate). Confocal image analysis demonstrated elevated Hsp70 expression in infected relative to uninfected cells and co-localization of dsRNA and Hsp70, suggesting that Hsp70 is a part of the virus replication complex (
