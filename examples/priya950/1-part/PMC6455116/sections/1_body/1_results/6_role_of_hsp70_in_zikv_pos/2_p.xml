<p>Effect of Hsp70 on viral RNA synthesis: We next tested whether the reduction of virus titre in the presence of Hsp70 inhibitor (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) could be explained by inhibition of viral genome transcription. We analysed the effect of MKT077 on viral mRNA synthesis. Total RNA was extracted from the untreated infected Huh7.5 cells and MKT077-treated infected cells harvested at different time points (1, 3, 6, and 9â€…h) after infection with ZIKV. In the presence of MKT077, a time-dependent reduction in the viral capsid mRNA was observed (
