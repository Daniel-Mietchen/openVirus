<p>MKT077 induces accumulation of intracellular ZIKV: We titrated the intracellular vs. extracellular virus titre in MKT007-treated cells to evaluate a possible role of Hsp70 in the release of virus particles. The cell membrane was ruptured by freeze-thaw cycles (3 times) to release the trapped cellular matured and infectious virus particles and was titrated by plaque assay. A dose-dependent increase in the intracellular infectious virus particles was observed compared to the extracellular virus indicating that Hsp70 impacts the release of mature virus particles (
