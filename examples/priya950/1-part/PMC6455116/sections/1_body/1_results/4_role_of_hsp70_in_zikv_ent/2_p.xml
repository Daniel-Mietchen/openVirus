<p>If Hsp70 plays a role in ZIKV entry, using anti-Hsp70 antibody or other competitor to block the interaction between Hsp70 and ZIKV would be expected to reduce ZIKV entry. Since Vero cells are the cell line of choice for the plaque reduction neutralization assay, (gold-standard for antibody-based experiments), we focused these investigations on Vero cells [

 <italic>Î²</italic>-actin or rabbit-IgG isotype (negative control) or Axl (which has been previously demonstrated to act as a cell receptor for ZIKV [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and which served as a positive control for the assay). Co-incubating with anti-Hsp70 antibody reduced the number of plaques by the plaque reduction neutralization assay to a similar extent as blocking Axl (
