<p>MKT077 is a potent allosteric inhibitor of Hsp70 that preferentially binds and inhibits the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) bound forms of Hsp70 [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To investigate the potential role of Hsp70 in the ZIKV infection process, we treated Huh7.5 human liver cells with MKT077. We first verified that MKT007 was not cytotoxic over the range of dosages used for our experiments (Figure S1). In the first set of experiments, we treated cells with MKT077 for 2â€…h before virus adsorption and then replenished the cells with maintenance medium. In the second set of experiments, cells were incubated along with MKT077 and maintenance medium after virus adsorption. After 48-h post-infection, infectious virus particles were measured in the culture supernatant. A dose-dependent reduction in the virus titre was observed for both experiments (
