<p>The binding of a virus to specific cell surface receptor(s) is a critical step for cellular tropism and an important determinant of pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In general, flavivirus cell infection is mediated by an array of cell surface molecules and attachment cofactors [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently the role of Axl, Tyro3, and TIM1 in the pathogenesis and entry of ZIKV to the neuronal and placental cell population has been described [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref>]. However, the understanding of the ZIKV cellular infection process is still in its initial stages and needs further investigation. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) has been shown to be one such factor for multiple viruses including dengue virus (DV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Hazara virus, and rotavirus, where it may act directly as a receptor or indirectly to help attach and gather viruses on the cell surface to facilitate interactions with specific high-affinity receptors [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16–19</xref>]. In addition, Hsp70 plays a role in controlling viral replication in multiple virus types, including DV, influenza A virus, rabies virus and others [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20–23</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that Hsp70 is an important factor in multiple stages of the ZIKV cell infection process including viral entry, replication, and egress. Understanding the interactions between Hsp70 and ZIKV may lead to novel therapeutics for ZIKV infection.
