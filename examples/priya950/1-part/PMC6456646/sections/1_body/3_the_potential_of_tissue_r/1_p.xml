<p>Since the initial discovery of highly cytotoxic memory T cells residing in tissues (Masopust et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), several studies have shown that CD8
 <sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T (T
 <sub>RM</sub>) cells residing in the female reproductive tract, the gut, the lung and the liver form a formidable frontline defense against various pathogen infections (Mueller and Mackay, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Rosato et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The protective role of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells is primarily due to their ability to (1) maintain a stable and durable population following their formation in tissues even in the absence of cognate antigen encounter following their formation (Gebhardt et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; MacKay et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Beura et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Park et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), and (2) produce anti-viral cytokines and/or exert cytotoxic functions to reduce the number of pathogen-infected cells and to recruit other immune cells (e.g., circulating memory T cells) rapidly to the site of infection (Schenkel et al., 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Muruganandah et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Park et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Furthermore, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells respond more rapidly, produce greater amounts of anti-viral/cytotoxic molecules (i.e., in the liver) and appear to be crucial for protection against liver tropic pathogens and pathogens exposed in the vagina and the female reproductive tract compared to circulating memory T cells (Cuburu et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Shin and Iwasaki, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Beura et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The greater frequency of intrahepatic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells (CD69
 <sup>+</sup> CD103
 <sup>+</sup>) amongst the total CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell population correlated with partial control of viraemia in Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-infected patients (Pallett et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), providing further encouragement that intrahepatic HCV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells will likely be protective against HCV.
