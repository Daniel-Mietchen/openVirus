<p>A recent study suggests that strategies that can induce interleukin (IL)-15 and/or inflammation in the liver can be effective in recruiting circulating effector CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells to differentiate into CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in the liver (Holz et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Systemic immunization strategies that promote up-regulation of gut homing molecules such as α4β7 on antigen-primed CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in secondary lymphoid organs can be efficiently recruited to establish residency in the gut (Masopust et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Although these studies and others suggest that local antigen deposition and antigen encounter are not essential to elicit CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells, it is evident that this process leads to the formation of greatest densities of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells especially at sites such as the liver and the vagina (Cuburu et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Davies et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Intravenous delivery of vaccine vectors appears to be most efficient route to facilitate local, intrahepatic expression of vaccine encoded antigens (Nganou-Makamdop et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Tay et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gola et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), to elicit high numbers of intrahepatic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells, and protection against hepatotropic pathogens compared to intradermal and intramuscular vaccine delivery routes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (Epstein et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Ishizuka et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gola et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In the vagina, several studies suggest that intravaginal delivery of vaccine vectors [HPV PsV, and Ad serotypes 26 (Ad26) and 35 (Ad35)] is the most efficient route to express vaccine-encoded antigens in vaginal tissues and elicit cervicovaginal CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (Cuburu et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Furthermore, topical application of chemokine ligands (CXCL9 and CXCL10) in the vagina have been reported to “pull” systemically primed effector CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells into the vagina and allow these cells to differentiate into CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells (Shin and Iwasaki, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).
