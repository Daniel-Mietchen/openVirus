<p>A DNA vaccine has been tested for therapeutic vaccination against HCV. 12 hepatitis C patients suffering from chronic disease received three doses of a DNA vaccine encoding codon optimized NS3/4A from gt1a virus via electroporation on the deltoid muscle which induced NS3-specific CMI and a transient decrease in viral RNA levels (Weiland et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The vaccine was also tested in eight patients who received interferon and ribavirin treatment of which six patients were completely cured of the infection (Weiland et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Thus, DNA vaccines could be exploited in therapeutic settings against HCV, but this is unlikely to occur in the future given the success of using DAA to cure hepatitis C patients.
