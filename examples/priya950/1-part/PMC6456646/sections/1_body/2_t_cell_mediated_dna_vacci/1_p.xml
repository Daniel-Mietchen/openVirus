<p>DNA vaccines against HCV have been routinely tested in small and large animals including non-human primates (Latimer et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gummow et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Grubor-Bauk et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Wijesundara et al., 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Some candidates have also progressed in phase I/II clinical trials, but none have progressed to a large-scale efficacy trial in humans. A promising DNA vaccine that included a cocktail of four plasmids with each plasmid encoding codon optimized NS3/4A, NS4B, NS5A, or NS5B sequences from gt1a/b virus was used to prime/boost vaccinate macaques by electroporation (Latimer et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In this study, the vaccine induced CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells against each of the NS proteins encoded in the DNA cocktail which has resulted in the testing of the DNA cocktail in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02027116) although the results are yet to be disclosed.
