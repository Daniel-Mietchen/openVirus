<p>The main limitation associated with DNA vaccines is their inability to induce long-term immune responses following a single or a few vaccinations (Abbink et al.,

Furthermore, DNA vaccines are poorly effective and not well-optimized in eliciting immunity in the liver, gut or genito-rectal mucosa which warrant further refinements of DNA-based vaccination regimens in order to elicit durable protection against HIV-1 and/or HCV.
