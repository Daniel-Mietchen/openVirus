<p>As mentioned above, it is important that a vaccination regimen designed to elicit CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells facilitate local antigen presentation to na√Øve and antigen experienced precursors of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells, which is best achieved by the local expression of vaccine-encoded antigens and/or promoting local inflammation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Manual massaging (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), hydrodynamic injections (Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and liposome complexes (Kawakami et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) are some commonly used techniques to transfect hepatocytes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> following intravenous delivery of DNA. The expression of vaccine-encoded antigens in hepatocytes is a common hallmark of studies that have elicited intrahepatic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells (Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Ishizuka et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), but none of these delivery strategies have led to a licensed vaccine for use in humans. Furthermore, it not known whether any of these strategies can elicit intrahepatic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in humans mainly owing to the difficulties of isolating liver biopsies in healthy patients although fine needle aspirates may be used to less invasively sample liver-resident T cells (Gill et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>) and the lack of biomarkers (i.e., in the blood) that can accurately predict the formation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in the liver and other tissues/organs. In the vagina, a proof of concept study has shown that DNA can be expressed following submucosal intravaginal delivery of DNA in mice (Sun et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, the same study reported poorly immunogenic responses in mice and noted that electroporation was required to improve the immunogenicity of intravaginally delivered DNA which could be difficult to exploit in humans.
