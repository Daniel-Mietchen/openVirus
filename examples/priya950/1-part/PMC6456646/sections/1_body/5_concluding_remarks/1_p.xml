<p>DNA has recently re-emerged as an effective vaccination platform in humans, but its use in developing a T cell-based vaccine will likely rely on its ability to be exploited in a regimen that can elicit robust immunity in the vagina and the gut in the context of HIV-1, or the liver in the context of HCV. In this regard, we have highlighted the importance of eliciting cervicovaginal or intrahepatic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells against these viruses and also reviewed strategies as well as caveats associated with using DNA to elicit localized CD8
