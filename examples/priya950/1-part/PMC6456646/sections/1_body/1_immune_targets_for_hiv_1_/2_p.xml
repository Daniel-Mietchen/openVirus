<p>It is now established that mucosal tissues, mainly the gentio-rectal tissues and gastrointestinal tract, are the major sites of HIV-1 entry and pathogenesis, respectively (Belyakov and Ahlers, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Induction of robust HIV-specific immune responses at these sites will be necessary to prevent HIV-1 infection or at the very least control viraemia during the acute phase of infection thus reducing the viral set point (McMichael and Koff, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and infection-induced microbial translocation which can result in diversion of immune responses to counteract dysbiosis (Vujkovic-Cvijin et al., 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Furthermore, a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine will likely be delivered using an active immunization strategy and attempt to mimic immune responses reported to be protective in macaques against simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and/or provide resistance against natural HIV-1 infections (Pontesilli et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Saez-Cirion et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Hansen et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Haynes et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Barouch et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Ackerman et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Borducchi et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In this regard, the most protective immune responses reported to date involve T cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (Pontesilli et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Saez-Cirion et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Hansen et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Borducchi et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), polyfunctional antibody responses (Barouch et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Ackerman et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (Haynes et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) (Burton and Hangartner, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Although potent bNAb represent a blueprint for HIV-1 vaccine design, these antibodies are unlikely to be as effective in preventing cell to cell transmission compared to neutralizing cell free virus (Parsons et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Consequently, a highly effective prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine will likely also rely on CMI to target highly conserved viral proteins such as Gag and Pol (Rolland et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and/or non-neutralizing antibodies to broadly target the virus Envelope to prevent cell-cell transmission of the virus.
