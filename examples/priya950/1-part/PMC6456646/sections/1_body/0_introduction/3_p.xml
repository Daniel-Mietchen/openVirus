<p>DNA vaccines have been investigated for nearly three decades and are essentially bacteria-derived plasmids genetically engineered to encode immunogens under the control of promoters that facilitate robust expression of DNA in mammalian cells to induce adaptive immunity (Ferraro et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). DNA vaccines are inexpensive, easily constructed, stable at room temperature, replication defective in transfected mammalian cells and have minimum side effects which simplifies handling and distribution such that even developing countries can benefit from DNA vaccines (Jorritsma et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Furthermore, plasmid DNA can be more easily used in multi-dose regimens unlike recombinant virus vectors that suffer from anti-vector immunity (Frahm et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Recent seminal studies described therapeutic DNA vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) which resulted in histological regression and/or eliminated persistent HPV infection and HPV-related cervical lesions (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Trimble et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). More recently, a DNA vaccine was developed that induced protective neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to Zika virus (ZIKV) in mice (Larocca et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and rhesus macaques (Abbink et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) leading to the development of safe and immunogenic ZIKV DNA vaccines for humans (Tebas et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Gaudinski et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Thus, the many advantages of using plasmid DNA to develop vaccines and the recent developments of DNA vaccines in eliciting protective immunity in humans and higher animal models warrant further examination as to how DNA vaccines can be harnessed in vaccination regimens to target HIV-1 and HCV.
