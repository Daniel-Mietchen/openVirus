<p>In each of the study sites, presumptive cases i.e. Influenza like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) were referred by the physicians (from the departments of Medicine, Pediatrics, Ear Nose and Throat and Obstetrics and Gynecology) to the project laboratory technician for throat/nasopharyngeal swab collection. The laboratory staff and other project staff were trained in sample processing and testing, data entry and database maintenance. The sample collected was then sent to the virology laboratory for testing. The demographic and clinical data were recorded at the time of sample collection and also validated by cross-checking with the hospital patient records.</p>
