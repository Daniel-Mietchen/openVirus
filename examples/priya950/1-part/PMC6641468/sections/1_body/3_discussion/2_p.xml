<p>The association between influenza activity and climatic factors was assessed for 78 geographical locations around the globe. At high latitudes, influenza peaks coincided with months of lower temperature and lower humidity.In contrast, peak influenza activity in localities within 10° of the equator correlated with months of high specific humidity and precipitation.At intermediate latitudes such as Pakistan, no significant association was observed which somewhat supports the findings of this study[
