<p>This study highlights the relationship between meteorological parameters and influenza activity in two major cities of Pakistan in the post-2011 pandemic period and also predicts influenza activity based on historical surveillance time series data. Time series analysis of infections is useful to propose new hypotheses, predict epidemics and peaks, and improve the disease response system. This study used the exponential smoothing model to forecast influenza incidence, contributing to an early warning system that can help public health planners take appropriate preventive measures, improve public awareness, and tackle the situation effectively.</p>
