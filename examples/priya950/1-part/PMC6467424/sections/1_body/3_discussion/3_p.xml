<p>A higher transmission rate (87%) of a Cambodian ZIKV strain (Asian lineage) has been reported for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Cairns in north Queensland [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Our data suggest the vector competence of Australian 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes could depend on the geographical origin of populations and the virus strain/genotype, although differences between experiments will also contribute to the variation. The importance of investigating vector/virus strain interactions was recently demonstrated for a strain of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from New Caledonia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Infection, dissemination and transmission rates were significantly lower for recently isolated ZIKV strains from Africa and Asian lineages, compared with older African lineage isolates. In compatible combinations, ZIKV transmission occurred as early as 6 dpi [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Such genotype Ã— genotype interactions have also been reported for DENV transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Our study is in agreement with proportions of mosquitoes able to transmit ZIKV at 14 dpi reported for American 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> challenged with Brazilian (75%), Puerto Rican (65%), and Malaysian (53%) ZIKV strains [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Similar to a study of French Polynesian 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we found a significant increase in ZIKV transmission percentages from early time points (3 and 7 dpi) to 14 dpi. Similar transmission patterns have also been observed for other commonly investigated flaviviruses, i.e. dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Our results from immunofluorescence analysis indicate that ZIKV transmission in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> potentially occurs from 10 dpi, similar to populations from the Island of Madeira in Portugal that were infectious at 9 days following an oral challenge with a New Caledonian ZIKV strain [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In contrast, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from Singapore were able to transmit an Ugandan ZIKV strain as early as 5 dpi [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].
