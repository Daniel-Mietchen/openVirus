<p>In the absence of an effective vaccine and as ZIKV transmission is primarily vector-borne, mosquito control is likely to be the most effective preventative measure. In this regard, the use of the endosymbiotic bacterium 
 <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic> has shown potential for the biocontrol of ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and other human pathogenic flaviviruses and alphaviruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Large field releases in north Queensland of novel

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, refractory to infection by a range of arboviruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], have shown the ability to drive 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> into wild populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007281.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Our data could be beneficial for modelling likely ZIKV transmission dynamics in north Queensland and addressing emerging ZIKV threats to Australia.
