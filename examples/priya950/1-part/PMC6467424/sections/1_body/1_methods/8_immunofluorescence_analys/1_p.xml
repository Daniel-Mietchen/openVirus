<p>The legs and wings were removed from mosquitoes and the remaining body was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X overnight before mosquitoes were transferred to 70% ethanol. Mosquitoes were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin using standard procedures. Paraffin sections (3–4 μM) were fixed to Menzel Superfrost Plus glass histology slides (Menzel-Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) and air-dried overnight at 37°C. The sections were dewaxed and rehydrated in a descending alcohol series to water, and antigen retrieval was performed in Dako Target Retrieval solution (pH 9.0) at 100°C for 20 min using a Biocare Medical decloaking chamber. On completion of the cooling cycle, slides were cooled for a further 20 min before being washed in three changes of Tris-buffered saline containing 0.025% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween). The sections were incubated in Background Sniper solution (Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA, USA) plus 1% BSA for 15 min to inhibit nonspecific antibody binding. Excess Background Sniper was removed and slides transferred to an opaque humidified chamber for subsequent incubation steps. Sections were incubated in 4G4 anti-Flavivirus NS1 monoclonal antibody hybridoma supernatant (undiluted) overnight at room temperature in a humidified chamber, washed three times in TBS-Tween, and incubated for 1 h in AlexaFluor-488 conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody, diluted 1:300 in TBS-Tween. After washing three times in TBS-Tween, sections were counterstained with the fluorescent DNA stain 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min, washed as above and mounted with coverslips using Dako fluorescent mounting medium. Slides were scanned using an Aperio ScanScope Fl slide scanner (Aperio Techologies, Vista, CA, USA) at a magnification of 20×. Quantitative image analysis was performed as previously described [
