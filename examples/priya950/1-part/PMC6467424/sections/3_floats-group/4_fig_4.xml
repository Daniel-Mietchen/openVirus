  </title>
  <p>Mosquitoes were examined by IFA for ZIKV by staining with an anti-
   <italic>Flavivirus</italic> NS1 protein monoclonal antibody (green) and DAPI staining for DNA (blue). (A) An example of a whole mosquito body section showing ZIKV infection in the midgut (m), head (h) and salivary glands (s). (B) Quantification of anti-ZIKV staining density. Staining areas were quantified by image analysis and were expressed as the area of ZIKV staining divided by the area of DAPI staining for each organ/tissue. Data are presented for midguts, bodies (whole mosquitoes minus the area covered by midgut tissue), heads and salivary glands for mosquitoes that had infection in at least one tissue/organ. Post hoc comparisons of the main effect of days post infection on ZIKV staining density was carried out for each organ by Sidakâ€™s method. Lines join comparisons where significant increases in ZIKV staining density had occurred for the main effect of days post infection. (C-E) High resolution images of ZIKV in infected mosquito midgut, head and salivary glands, respectively.
