  <p>(A) Quantification of ZIKV staining density relative to DNA over time, calculated as described for 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007281.g004">Fig 4</xref>. (B) High resolution image of ZIKV staining in the follicular epithelium of mature oocytes within 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> ovaries. Green, ZIKV infection. Blue, DNA. Post hoc comparisons of the main effect of days post infection on ZIKV staining density was carried out for each organ by Sidakâ€™s method. Lines join comparisons where significant increases in ZIKV staining density had occurred for the main effect of days post infection.
