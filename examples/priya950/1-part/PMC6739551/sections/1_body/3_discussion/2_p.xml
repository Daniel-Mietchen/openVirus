<p>Due to the proximity of the Benin Republic to Nigeria and reports of several Lassa fever outbreaks in Nigeria since 1969, it was expected that a case of Lassa fever should have been reported in the Benin Republic earlier than now due to fluidic inter-border travel between the two countries. Furthermore, reports have shown that migration of the Lassa virus strains out of Nigeria over a long period of time might have contributed to the increased diversity of LASV, with non-Nigerian strains exhibiting improved codon adaptation to the human host, greater viral loads, and increased case fatality rates.
