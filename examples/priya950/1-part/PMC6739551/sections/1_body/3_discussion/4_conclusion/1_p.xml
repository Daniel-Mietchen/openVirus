<p>Despite the findings from this study, it is still envisioned that the likelihood of movement of VHFs, particularly LASV, from endemic into non-endemic countries within and beyond the West African sub-region remains a possibility. Increased awareness and surveillance are effective tools in curbing the menace of these agents. Thus, laboratory infrastructure, appropriate facilities, technical proficiency and investigation capacity must be improved for a positive impact on our surveillance mechanisms, diagnosis and identification of infections, clinical case management and the development of new approaches to control Lassa fever outbreaks in the sub-region.</p>
