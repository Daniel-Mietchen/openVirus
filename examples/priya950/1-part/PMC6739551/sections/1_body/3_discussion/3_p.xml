<p>Our phylogenetic analysis of the partial sequences of the glycoprotein region of the Lassa fever virus shows that the 2014 Benin Republic nucleic acid sequence clustered with the Lily Pinneo strain of 1969, whereas the 2016 sequence clustered with the 1974 Onitsha strain. Our findings indicate that the virus may have existed in the 
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> sp. reservoir in the Benin Republic, which did not affect humans until the 2014 outbreak, highlighting the possibility of the emergence of the virus in the Benin Republic which is possibly not a case of inter-border travel. However, cross border transmission from Nigeria to the Benin Republic and vice versa is also still a possibility. Thus, more surveillance studies are required particularly among rodents in the Benin Republic for a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of the Lassa fever virus in the country.
