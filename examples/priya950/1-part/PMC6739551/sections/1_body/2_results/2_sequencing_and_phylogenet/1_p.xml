<p>Sequence data of the S segment of the RNA genome of LASV were obtained for 2/5 (40%) of the positive samples. The generated nucleotide sequences of the S segment of the RNA genome of the Lassa strains from the Benin Republic showed relatedness with documented LASV strains particularly from Nigeria. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the 2 LASV strains from the Benin Republic with submitted sequences in the GenBank database showed that each of the strains were closely related to Lineage I that covers the 1969 Lassa LP strain and Lineage II which covers strains from Lagos, the eastern states of Nigeria such as the Onitsha strain in 1974, Abakaliki, Irrua, the middle belt and a few northeast central states in Nigeria as shown in
