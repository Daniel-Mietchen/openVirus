<p>The viral nucleic acid from inactivated sample aliquots (undiluted and 1:10 dilution) were extracted using a mini spin column RNA extraction kit by Qiagen (Qiagen, Germantown, Maryland, United States) in a Class IIA biological safety cabinet according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After the extraction of viral nucleic acid, S segment of the RNA genome, 3` non-coding region and 5` non-coding region of the nucleic acid of LASV (according to Olschlager et al.

 </sup>), Dengue virus (according to Drosten et al.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
 </sup>) and yellow fever virus (using in-house primers) were amplified in discrete RT-PCRs with primers as listed in 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Separate reaction mixtures for Lassa, Dengue and yellow fever viruses were prepared and cycled as described in the One-Step RT-PCR kit by AmbionAgPath-ID protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States). The reaction was performed using the 9700 Applied Biosystems Thermocycler with the following temperature profile: 50 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s with a final extension of 72 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, PCR amplicons were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis with 1X SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> Safe DNA gel staining dye (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) for 30 min at 120 V/400mA and images of amplicon bands under UV light were taken with a BioDocAnalyze 2.0 (Biometra, Goettingen, Germany).
