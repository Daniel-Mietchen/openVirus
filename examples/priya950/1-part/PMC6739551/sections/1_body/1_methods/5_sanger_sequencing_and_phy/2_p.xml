<p>Sequence data in FASTA format of the S segment of the RNA genome of other submitted or published LASV genome sequences particularly from Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Downloaded sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE tool of MEGA6 software.

 </sup> The Tamura 3-parameter (T92) model was used to deduce the phylogeny of the strains. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method. Evolutionary rate differences among sites (
 <italic>+G</italic>, parameter = 0.5024) were determined with a discrete Gamma distribution and the evolutionary invariability allowed for some sites was estimated to be

 </sup> using the variation rate model. The consistency of each node on the phylogenetic tree was verified by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates.
