<p>A resurgence of the epidemic was witnessed in several districts in the central and eastern regions of the Benin Republic in 2016 with reports of 54 suspected cases with signs and symptoms of VHF and 16 laboratory confirmed cases, with a case fatality of about 50%. During this outbreak, the communes of Tchaourou (Borgou department) and Djougou (Donga department) along the Nigerian border were the most affected areas. Since the Benin Republic had never identified a case of VHF, blood samples collected from the people who died and suspected cases were sent to a specialised laboratory, the Centre for Human and Zoonotic Virology, College of Medicine, University of Lagos and the Lagos University Teaching Hospital in Lagos, Nigeria, for VHF investigation.</p>
