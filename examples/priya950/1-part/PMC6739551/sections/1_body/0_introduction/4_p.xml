 </sup> We report the detection, confirmation and phylogenetic relationship of LASV from these outbreaks using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the 5` region of the S segment of the RNA genome and Sanger sequencing of partial fragments of the S segment of the RNA genome.
