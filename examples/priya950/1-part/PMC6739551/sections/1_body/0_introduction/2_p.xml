 </sup> Transmission is mainly by the ingestion of food or materials contaminated with feces or urine of infected rodents. However, human-to-human transmission of the virus in hospital settings or within the community expands the spread during epidemics.

 </sup> Additionally, global travel, international trading and related commitments are also efficient routes of transmission for highly infectious pathogens, particularly those causing Lassa fever and other viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs). By these routes, the movement of infectious agents from endemic countries to new places is a more probable event than has been documented.
