<p>Hence, the dynamic virus–host interactions can elicit alterations in the host proteome to benefit viral replication. Several groups have studied the establishment of temporally and spatially regulated virus–host protein–protein interactions throughout the course of infection, essentially to identify unanticipated cellular factors required for influenza replication and pathogenicity, or related to host antiviral responses, and targetable host factors to guide antiviral drug development [

 <xref rid="B48-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Some of these studies identified abundant proteins in IAV-infected cells as being associated with protein synthesis, chaperone-mediated responses, protein metabolism and modification, including protein folding and proteolysis, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system [

 <xref rid="B47-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Interestingly, Lietzén et al. (2011) have shown that IAV regulates the expression and/or the subcellular location of host proteins at early phases of infection, suggesting a dynamic interplay between subcellular compartments [

Hence, these reports seem to suggest that the characterization of the subcellular proteome, rather than the total proteome, might give more precise insights into whether proteostasis is being disrupted at different stages of the viral life cycle.
