<p>The viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) can block the processing of cellular pre-mRNA [
 <xref rid="B24-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and targets the polyadenylation tail of nascent cellular transcripts [
 <xref rid="B25-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which in turn inhibits the nuclear export of mature mRNA and thus their translation. In contrast, the NS1 protein from IBV, as it lacks the carboxyl-terminal effector domain in comparison to IAV NS1, is not capable of inhibiting mRNA polyadenylation or nuclear export [
 <xref rid="B27-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
