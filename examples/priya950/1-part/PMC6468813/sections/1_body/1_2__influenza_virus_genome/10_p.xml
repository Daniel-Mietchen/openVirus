<p>Furthermore, due to the importance of the transfer RNA (tRNA) pool in protein synthesis, viruses have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate tRNA populations and optimize tRNA usage to enhance the efficiency of viral translation (reviewed in [

The authors demonstrated that, although the total cellular tRNA population remains unchanged upon infection, the polysome-associated tRNA is selectively and significantly altered, suggesting the existence of tRNA pools adapted to viral codon usage upon IAV and VV infections [

Interestingly, pandemic strains of IAV, which cause high morbidity and mortality in humans, usually arise as a consequence of the reassortment of avian and human influenza virusâ€™s gene segments, which requires an adaptation of the avian segments to the human hosts. It was recently reported that RNA-directed RNA polymerase catalytic subunit (PB1) protein from the avian influenza pandemic virus H3N2 (1698) evolved in humans to reduce the IFN inhibition by skewing codon usage, partially alleviating the antiviral activities induced by IFN [
