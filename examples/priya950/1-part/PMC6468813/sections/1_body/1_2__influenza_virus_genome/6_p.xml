<p>NS1 has also been described to enhance the translation initiation rate of viral mRNA [
 <xref rid="B28-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], by allowing its preferential translation to the detriment of cellular mRNA [
 <xref rid="B29-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, contradictory results demonstrate that, although being a general translational enhancer, NS1 does not play a major role in host cell protein synthesis shutoff, suggesting that other IAV products can have a more prominent role in this process [
