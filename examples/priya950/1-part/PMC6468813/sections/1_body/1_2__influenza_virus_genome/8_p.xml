<p>Other mechanisms have been proposed to explain host shutoff by IAV such as cap snatching, in which the virus uses short oligomers from host pre-mRNA to prime its own mRNA synthesis [
 <xref rid="B39-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This process was suggested to be distinct among influenza viruses, since IBV polymerase possesses a distinct cap recognition mechanism in comparison to IAV [

 <xref rid="B42-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, viral polymerase acidic protein X (PA-X), expressed from polymerase acidic protein (PA) mRNA as a result of ribosomal frameshifting, degrades target host mRNA both in the nucleus and cytoplasm [
