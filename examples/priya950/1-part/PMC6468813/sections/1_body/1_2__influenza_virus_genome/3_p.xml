<p>The IAV genome consists of eight single-stranded negative-sense linear RNA segments (ssRNA), encoding for a different number of proteins depending on the virus strain [
 <xref rid="B20-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The eight RNA segments are separately enclosed in the form of ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs), each wrapped in a helical conformation with the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and a trimeric viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex. The virus particles are covered by a lipidic bilayer envelope, spiked with the membrane-spanning viral glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA). This virus also encodes for structural matrix proteins (M) that link the envelope with the virus core, and non-structural proteins (NS) required for an efficient replication.
