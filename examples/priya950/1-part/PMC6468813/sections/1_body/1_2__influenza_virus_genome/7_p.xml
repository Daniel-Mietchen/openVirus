<p>NS1 was reported to prevent the activation of the double stranded DNA (dsDNA)-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), both upon IAV and IBV infection [
 <xref rid="B27-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This inhibition is thought to be mediated by the formation of a complex between the two proteins [

 <xref rid="B32-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,

 <xref rid="B34-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. PKR functions as a gatekeeper of mRNA translation initiation since, upon activation, it phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF2α) decreasing protein synthesis in response to stress signals, mainly as a result of viral infections (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B35-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). However, it is also claimed that PKR activity is not relevant for the preferential translation of viral mRNAs during infection [
 <xref rid="B36-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Besides interfering with PKR, the viral NS1 is known to inhibit host immune responses by limiting the effects of antiviral interferon (IFN) production through the 2′5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L signaling blockage [
 <xref rid="B37-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is known that RNA cleavage events catalyzed by RNase L are required for optimal inflammasome activation during viral infections [
