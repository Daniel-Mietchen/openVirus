<p>As opportunistic infectious agents, viruses employ several strategies to hijack and control cellular activities, including protein production and processing, in order to efficiently replicate. Multiple viruses specifically alter organelle morphology and dynamics as part of their replication cycle [

 <xref rid="B12-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Viruses induce the formation of specialized nuclear or cytoplasmic microenvironments, involving an extensive rearrangement of the cellular cytoskeleton and membrane compartments. These virus-induced compartments, generally termed virus factories, are important not only to recruit and concentrate viral and host components and facilitate the molecular interactions required for essential steps of the viral life cycle, but also to control the cellular antiviral defense [

 <xref rid="B15-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. On the other hand, it is often considered that these inclusion bodies may be part of the host antiviral response to infection [
