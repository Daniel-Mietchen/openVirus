<p>In mammalian cells, protein homeostasis or proteostasis maintenance is assured through an integrated network that ensures efficient biogenesis, folding and assembling of proteins, as well as the degradation of abnormal conformers. Cells are frequently exposed to external stimuli that can disrupt proteostasis leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and, under unmitigated chronic stress conditions, to the formation of potentially pathogenic cytotoxic aggregates [

To counteract the detrimental effect of aberrant protein accumulation, cells have evolved elaborated protein quality control mechanisms that can adapt to the severity of protein damage, repair disturbances in the proteome and re-establish basal homeostasis [

Distinct surveillance mechanisms that maintain or re-establish proteostasis have been characterized in the cytoplasm, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and in the mitochondria, including protein refolding mechanisms, degradation pathways, and sequestration. The maintenance of cellular proteome homeostasis is crucial to preserve cellular viability and is essential, among other reasons, to ensure healthy aging and to minimize homeostasis distress caused by extrinsic factors [
