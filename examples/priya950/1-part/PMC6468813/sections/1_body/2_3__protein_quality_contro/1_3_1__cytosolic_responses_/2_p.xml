<p>Various chaperones, mainly the heat shock proteins (HSPs), have evolved to assist the efficient folding and assembly of newly synthesized and stress-damaged proteins, in order to prevent potentially pathogenic protein aggregation [
 <xref rid="B57-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The expression of many chaperones is induced upon viral replication, either contributing to the cellular response to infection or facilitating viral propagation. In the latter case, viruses can usurp chaperones by exploiting or modifying their specific roles in order to support infection [
 <xref rid="B10-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Remarkably, some viruses can encode for their own chaperone-like proteins to enhance their infectivity [
