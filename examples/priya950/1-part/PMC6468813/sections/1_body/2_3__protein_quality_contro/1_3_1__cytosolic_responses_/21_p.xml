<p>Whether IAV leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins is still not known. Yet, it is known that IAV usurps the HDAC6 ubiquitin-binding function, taking advantage of the aggresome processing machinery for capsid disassembly and uncoating during entry in cell [

The fusion pore formed between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane exposes the viral core that contains unanchored ubiquitin chains to the cytosol, which might activate HDAC6 similarly to aggresome processing, culminating with the viral genome release into the cytoplasm to be further imported to the nucleus. Recently, it was found that HDAC6 restrict IAV transcription and replication by deacetylation of the viral RNA polymerase PA subunit, promoting its proteasomal degradation [
