<p>At late stages of infection, matrix protein 2 (M2) IAV protein is suggested to form a stable complex with Hsp40 and p58
 <sup>IPK</sup>, a cellular inhibitor of PKR, consequently enhancing PKR activation [
 <xref rid="B67-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Moreover, the expression of viral NP coincides with the dissociation of p58
 <sup>IPK</sup> and Hsp40 to mitigate PKR-mediated antiviral response against IAV infection and ease viral replication [
 <xref rid="B68-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Considering that p58
 <sup>IPK</sup> was shown to regulate IAV mRNA translation and promote viral protein synthesis through PKR [
 <xref rid="B69-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], these reports suggest that the virus can, to some extent, manipulate the regulation of PKR activation depending on the infection stage, though the modulation of Hsp40- p58
 <sup>IPK</sup> interaction.
