<p>In response to immune activation, rather than impaired proteolysis, the formation of aggresome-like induced structures (ALIS) in the cytosol is also induced as an early event in the cellular adjustment to proteostasis disruption, consisting in the temporary aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins [
