<p>It was already reported that the formation of SGs was not observed upon infection with IAV, suggesting that this virus can efficiently prevent global translation arrest [
 <xref rid="B110-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. However, in cells infected with the same viral strain comprising specific mutations on the NS1 protein, SGs start to accumulate at a time post infection that coincides with a strong activation of PKR, a well-known translation inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B110-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Since NS1 is previously shown to prevent PKR activation [
 <xref rid="B31-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the inhibition of SG formation might be in part dependent on the function of NS1.
