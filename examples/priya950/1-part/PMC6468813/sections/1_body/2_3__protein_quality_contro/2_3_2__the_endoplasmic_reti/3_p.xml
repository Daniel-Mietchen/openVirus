<p>Upon infection, the UPR might either be mobilized by the host in an attempt to restrict viral propagation or be manipulated by the virus to benefit its replication. For instance, the innate sensing of viruses by ER stress was found to be responsible for the pathogenicity of pandemic IAV [

On the other hand, the ER-sensing of viral glycoproteins, namely the viral HA protein, which mediates the attachment of the viral particle to the host cell and escape from the endosome, triggers an antiviral immunity response that inhibits IAV replication, resulting in the rapid proteasomal-degradation of this protein mediated by the ERAD pathway [
