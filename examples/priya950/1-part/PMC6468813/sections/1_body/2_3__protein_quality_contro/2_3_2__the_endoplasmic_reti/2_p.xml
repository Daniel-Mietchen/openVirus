<p>Once a threshold of misfolded protein accumulation in the ER has been reached, it activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B116-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]). As an immediate response, general protein translation is attenuated through the activation of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) to decrease the load of newly synthesized proteins into ER. Simultaneously, the activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) leads to the preferential degradation of mRNA encoding for ER-localized proteins via IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD), and to an unconventional splicing of the transcription factor X box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA that controls the expression of UPR-related genes. Lastly, the activation of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathway also contributes to the synthesis of stress-attenuating proteins, as chaperones and folding catalysts. In addition, the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) may also be activated, which allows the clearance of misfolded and accumulated proteins in the ER, and, if these steps fail, the UPR might ultimately lead to apoptosis.
