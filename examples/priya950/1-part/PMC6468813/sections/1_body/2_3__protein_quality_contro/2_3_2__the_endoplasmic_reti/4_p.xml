<p>The role of the UPR during IAV infection is unclear, since the results on the subject are somewhat controversial. Hassan et al. [
 <xref rid="B119-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] reported that IAV induces ER stress responses through IRE1, with little or no concomitant activation of the PERK and the ATF6 pathway, and further showed that IAV causes a significant induction of several ER-stress response-related genes, including CHOP and GADD34. Inversely, Roberson et al. [
 <xref rid="B120-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] demonstrated that IAV can induce ER-stress via ATF6 activation, but not CHOP. Yet, chemical genomics identified PERK as a cellular target for influenza virus inhibition, as, according to the authors [
 <xref rid="B121-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], IAV can lead to the attenuation of PERK-mediated UPR, but does not distress neither ATF6 or IRE1 arms, in contrast to Hassan and Robersonâ€™s results [
 <xref rid="B119-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>,
 <xref rid="B120-cells-08-00228" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. It is important to consider though that the approaches used by the groups are distinct and further analysis are needed in order to fully understand the response mediated by the UPR in the course of IAV infection (
