 <caption>
  <p>Schematic representation of the transcription and translation machinery in (
   <bold>a</bold>) uninfected and (
   <bold>b</bold>) influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells. (
   <bold>a</bold>) After being transcribed and processed in the nucleus, mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm where ribosomes initiate their translation. Afterwards, it can either remain free at the cytosol or attach to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Upon infection, IAV hijacks different stages of mRNA biogenesis and ultimately reduces host protein translation. The virus can also manipulate tRNA pools within the cell to enable the efficient translation of viral proteins. Viral proteins are represented underlined.
