 <caption>
  <p>Schematic representation of cellular proteostasis mechanisms and its interplay with IAV proteins during infection. During its life cycle, the virus can interfere with several cellular proteostasis-related mechanisms, namely by (
   <bold>a</bold>) inhibiting stress granule formation or taking advantage of autophagosome formation, as well as by (
   <bold>b</bold>) manipulating ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-related proteins to efficiently replicate. Viral proteins are represented underlined.
