<p id="Par35">We investigated the proposed model performance on simulated data. We simulated bivariate data using a frequentist approach in R software using the package “Surveillance” previously used by Held et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We used the function “hhh4” with the class “disprog” to simulate two disease pathogen counts replicated 10,000 times. We then applied the Bayesian approach to compare different models based on varied scenarios. We considered a situation where there is the presence of overdispersion with the parameter 
 <italic>ψ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> ≠ 0 assuming the negative binomial distribution and where 
 <italic>ψ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> = 0 assumes the Poisson distribution. We also considered the presence and absence of the parameter 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (the ‘epidemic’ component) to evaluate temporal dependence. In this simulation, we disregarded the linear trend. It is evident from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> that the simulation results show that 
 <italic>ψ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> = 0 and therefore the best performing model is the Poisson (model 2) with the presence of the epidemic component having the least AIC = 1626.58. This implies that in the simulated data there was no overdispersion but rather temporal dependence.
