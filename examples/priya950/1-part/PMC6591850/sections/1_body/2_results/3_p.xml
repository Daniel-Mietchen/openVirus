<p id="Par43">Model 6(i) in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> does not allow for interactions between HMPV and RSV (
 <italic>ϕ</italic>
 <sub>HMPV</sub> = 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>
 <sub>RSV</sub> = 0) and its DIC value is 543.68. Model 6(ii) includes the influence of HMPV on RSV with the influence of RSV on HMPV equal to zero. This model yielded a DIC value of 457.61. Model 6(iii) includes the influence of RSV on HMPV where the influence of HMPV on RSV is zero. Compared to the others, this model yielded the smallest DIC value of 112.14 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This implies that the two viruses can present as a co-infection where HMPV incidence is increased by increases in RSV. The results from sensitivity analysis shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, indicates that this model is robust and insensitive to the prior distribution since its posterior distribution did not dramatically change upon altering the base prior parameter values. Model 6(iv) has both the influence of RSV on HMPV and the influence of HMPV on RSV which is the full model with a DIC value of 173.52 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This indicates that the additional parameter (i.e., the influence of HMPV on RSV) into model 6(iii) does not significantly improve the model fit to data.
