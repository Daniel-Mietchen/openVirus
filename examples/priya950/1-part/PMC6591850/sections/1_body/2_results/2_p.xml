<p id="Par42">We compared 12 models with various structures (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and the results for the DIC values are given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Models 6 and 1 with climatic factors clearly out-perform the other models since, overall, they have lower DIC values. Model 6 with climatic factors had the least DIC value (173.52) and provided the best fit and explanation for the variation observed in the data. The models showed that the inclusion of climatic factors play an important role in the estimation of the number of cases for the two epidemics (RSV and HMPV). We further considered different scenarios on the best model with four sub-models (results are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).
