<p id="Par41">The monthly observed number of RSV and HMPV cases in Dadaab from September 2007 to August 2011 that were collected in the surveillance system was plotted (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The HMPV data shows a strong seasonality pattern as indicated by the four peaks during November of the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 while a fourth peak appears in March 2011 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These HMPV peaks coincide with the RSV peaks.
