 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] who investigated the clinical and epidemiological assessment of HMPV and RSV in Seoul, Korea, 2003–2008. In their paper, Cuevas et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] observed that HMPV incidence had increased with increases in RSV incidence. Another study in Yemen, children younger than 2 years identified co-infections of RSV and HMPV, and also showed that there were seasonal variations of RSV and HMPV with a peak of RSV in December and January and a peak of HMPV in February and March [
