<p id="Par46">From our previous work using the same dataset, we noted a similar conclusion that the use of climatic factors explained the seasonality of RSV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This implies that having considered the different rate for each virus at every time point, the models with the best fit to data were those with climatic factors. In our study, we have shown that the incidence of RSV influenced that of HMPV from the best model fit. It is therefore crucial to establish good RSV surveillance systems in developing countries to help understand the dynamics of the disease. This will aid in knowing when to put up an intervention to control for RSV and HMPV outbreaks. Some of the interventions include washing hands with soap and avoiding overcrowding. A similar observation was made by Lazar et al. who noted that HMPV did not contribute to the severity of RSV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This is corroborated in findings from a similar investigation of the influence of RSV on HMPV by Greensill et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] in which 70% of children infected with RSV were co-infected with HMPV. Elsewhere, Cuevas et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] observed that HMPV incidence increased with increasing number of RSV cases suggesting the presence of a strong association between the dynamics of the two epidemics.
