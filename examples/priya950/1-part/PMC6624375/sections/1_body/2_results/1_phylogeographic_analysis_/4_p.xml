<p id="Par17">Similar analysis of the Core-E1 region for HCV subtype 1b, which is the most predominant subtype in the general population in Cyprus, suggested that the sources of origin were Belarus, Russia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the USA (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1b</xref>). Analysis of the subtype 1b NS5B region suggested that France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, and Vietnam were the origins of infection within Cyprus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2b</xref>). Viral migration matrices are shown in Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>. Significant trans-continental mobility (incoming) of subtype 1b was observed from the USA, Oceania, and South Eastern Asia, while Western Europe, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe produced lower levels of incoming mobility. Unlike for subtype 1a, the USA was a significant source of subtype 1b viral infections in Cyprus. Cyprus was also a source for outgoing subtype 1b viral mobility to Belarus, China, Germany, Japan, Russia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan (Core-E1) and Australia, France, Greece, Italy, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Great Britain, and the USA (NS5B) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Cyprus served both as a global sink and a source for subtype 1b infections in both the Core-E1 and NS5B regions.
