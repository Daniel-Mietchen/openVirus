<p id="Par16">Inferences about the trans-continental origin of HCV subtype 1a in Cyprus are likely more credible in NS5B, where both European and non-European references are available. Although Cyprus exported 1a infections to Germany and Switzerland (Core-E1), no outgoing viral mobility was observed within the NS5B region. Based on these patterns of incoming and outgoing viral mobility, Cyprus was received subtype 1a infections and provided limited subsequent dispersal to other locations. The USA was not among the source areas for subtype 1a to Cyprus. To further confirm the inferred pattern for the non-importing nature of the epidemic from the USA, phylogeographic analysis after a random down sampling of references from the USA was repeated. Two sampling rounds down to 20% and 10% of the US sequences were performed while the rest of the dataset was stable. For both analyses, importing viral mobility from the USA to Cyprus was not significant, thus confirming the initial inference about the non-importing pattern for the subtype 1a epidemic in Cyprus.</p>
