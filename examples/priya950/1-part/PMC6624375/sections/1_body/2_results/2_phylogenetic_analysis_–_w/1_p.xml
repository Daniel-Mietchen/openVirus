<p id="Par20">Due to incarcerated individuals and PWID being part of high-risk groups for HCV infection, the origin of HCV transmissions among these populations in Cyprus were specially analysed. Phylogenetic analysis was performed for these groups using sequences from different risk groups with a globally sampled dataset as a reference. These results were compared to the analysis of HCV infection within the general population (i.e. low risk group) in Cyprus. All analyses were only conducted for subtypes 1b and 3a which were almost exclusively the subtypes identified in these high-risk groups
