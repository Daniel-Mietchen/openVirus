<p id="Par22">The remaining two sequences from the incarcerated individuals clustered together with very short branches suggesting a recent common origin of infection. They fell within a monophyletic group of sequences (group II) sampled from Cyprus, Uzbekistan and Belarus. The majority of sequences from Cyprus within group II (7 out of 13, 54%) were from PWID; four were from the general population and two were from the target group. The remaining non-Cypriot sequences (collected from Uzbekistan) were also from PWID, while this specific demographic information from Belarus was not available. Given that the majority of strains within group II belonged to sequences from PWID, the most plausible hypothesis is that the putative origin of infection for the two incarcerated individuals was due to transmission from an PWID or drug paraphernalia. These findings were also confirmed in NS5B where identical phylogenetic clustering between sequences from incarcerated individuals and PWID from different areas was detected.</p>
