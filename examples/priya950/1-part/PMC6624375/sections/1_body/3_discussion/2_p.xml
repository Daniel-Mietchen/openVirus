<p id="Par25">Aggregately, the observed subtypes transmitted to Cyprus had origins in four continents, suggesting a complex transmission dynamic with trans-continental characteristics. HCV transmission occurred from the Americas and Western Europe, but also notably from Eastern Europe, Asia, and Oceania. These dynamics are like a result of Cyprusâ€™ close ties with both Eastern and Western Europe in addition to its geographic location as a crossroads of three continents. No transmission to or from Africa was observed regarding to Cyprus despite their geographic proximity. While African countries have high prevalences of multiple HCV genotypes, these genotypes have demonstrated minimal transcontinental distribution and since African data is often not well documented and sequence data is likely not as readily available in online repositories

 </sup>. However, the geographically widespread sequence data that is currently available is still useful for understanding the phylogeographic trends of HCV and elucidating the difference distribution and movement patterns among the subtypes.
