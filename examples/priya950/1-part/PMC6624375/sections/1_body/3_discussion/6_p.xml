<p id="Par29">While this study examined a broad group of individuals with HCV, incarcerated individuals and PWID were populations of note, given the high-risk of HCV among them. While phylogeographic analysis was used to trace transnational patterns of transmission, it also revealed the dispersal patterns among these populations in Cyprus. Within the incarcerated population, newest infections arose from PWID already within Cyprus. These findings indicate a shared subtype within these populations, suggesting how certain risk factors can predispose to infection by a specific subtype. Highlighting this finding, two incarcerated individuals displayed evidence of a common source of infection within a cluster of PWID from Cyprus and other areas, reinforcing trends between countries and risk groups. These results were robust across a variety of genotypes. This suggests that injections of intravenous drugs pose a risk for HCV transmission among incarcerated individuals. Responding to these transmission trends, HCV prevention should be intensified and target this high-risk group with risk-appropriate measures such as volunteer testing for HCV and treatment using the direct acting antivirals (DAAs) against HCV.</p>
