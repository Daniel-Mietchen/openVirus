<p id="Par27">Although modern transmission patterns are becoming better understood, it is not known when HCV developed within animal populations and how the disease spread to humans. It is likely that the genotypes of HCV arose in humans at different timeframes and have spread at different rates with varying geographic distributions

 </sup>. Later the virus also began to spread more extensively due to intravenous drug use, drug trafficking, and human movement. Some specific transmission mechanisms are now associated with individual subtypes. The viral migration patterns of subtype 3a can likely be explained by the movement of drug trafficking and PWID, since the subtype primarily circulates among PWID
