 </sup>. The greater complexity of the dissemination of HCV than of HIV-1 is likely due to differences in the epidemiology of the pathogens. HCV has infected humans for a longer time and over a wider geographic distribution prior to its exponential growth than HIV-1. Different transmission routes and factors related to the host response in humans likely also shape how the viruses have distinctly spread. The results of this study suggest that subtype-specific HCV transmission patterns exist within not only within Cyprus but also between Cyprus and widely globally distributed countries. Additional studies are needed to better understand the spatial characteristics and factors that have and will shape the global HCV epidemic.
