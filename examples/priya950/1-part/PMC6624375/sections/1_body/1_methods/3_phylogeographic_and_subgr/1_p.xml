<p id="Par9">Phylogeographic analysis was used to estimate viral migration events and determine the geographical origin and distribution of HCV infections in and from Cyprus. Migration events were inferred by using a cladistics approach as described by Slatkin and Maddison

 </sup>. Geographic location (sampling area) was assigned at the tips of the maximum likelihood inferred phylogenetic trees in partial Core-E1 and NS5B regions, for subtypes 1a, 1b and 3a. Ancestral character states were reconstructed at the tree nodes by parsimony. Migration events corresponded to character changes (geographic locations) across the tree topology. To account for phylogenetic uncertainty, migration events were estimated over all bootstrap trees and were calculated as the median of the distribution inferred from all trees used in the analysis as described previously
