<p id="Par10">Six migration matrices corresponding to the 2 genomic regions each with 3 subtypes were created. To estimate which viral mobility pathways were statistically higher than expected under the null hypothesis of geographic panmixis (full geographic mixing), a statistical phylogeographic analysis was performed as described previously

 </sup>. The distribution of migration events estimated over the bootstrap trees (observed values) for each genotype in each genomic region was checked against the distribution of events estimated over the same set of trees after a random reshuffling of taxa (expected values) to assess for statistical differences. Reshuffling of taxa was performed on the bootstrap-reconstructed trees, using Mesquite program version 3.5

 </sup>. The distributions of observed and expected migrations events for each migration matrix were compared using the 1- sided Mann-Whitney test. Due to multiple comparisons, the significance level (α = 0.05) was adjusted according to Bonferroni correction.
