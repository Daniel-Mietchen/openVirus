<p id="Par7">Multiple sequences from the same patient and duplicates (100% identical) were excluded from the alignments. Duplicates were detected using the ElimDupes online tool, available at Los Alamos HIV sequence database [

Sequences from unknown country of origin were also omitted from the analyses. The genotypes of all HCV sequences were confirmed using the COMET-HCV automated subtyping tool (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://comet.lih.lu/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://comet.lih.lu/</ext-link>). All sequences falsely assigned to subtypes 1a, 1b, or 3a were discarded from the alignment. Sequence alignments and editing were carried out manually in line with the encoded reading frame using the MEGA6 software

 </sup>. The final alignments in Core-E1 and NS5B were of 417 and 405 nucleotides in length, respectively. The number of sequences analyzed were 1,200 (1a), 1,289 (1b), and 318 (3a) in Core-E1 and 1,052 (1a), 967 (1b), and 346 (3a) in NS5B. A random down sampling was performed for the alignments of 1a in both Core-E1 and NS5B regions at 5%, 10%, and 20% of United States sequences since it is the geographic area with the largest representation in the database and therefore in our analysis. The down sampling was performed to assess the impact of sampling from the area with the largest representation on the estimation of viral migration.
