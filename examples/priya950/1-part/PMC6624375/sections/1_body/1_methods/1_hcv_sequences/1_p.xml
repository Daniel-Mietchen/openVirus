<p id="Par6">As part of this study, newly-obtained HCV sequences of both the Core-E1 region (21 sequences, 417 nucleotides-long corresponding to positions 867–1283 of the reference sequence of the H77 strain (accession number AF009606)) and NS5B region (20 sequences, 405-nucleotide-long, positions 8277–8681) were obtained in a prospective HCV molecular epidemiology study (2011–2012) of intravenous drug-users attending therapy in Cyprus. Blood samples were collected from 67 consenting study subjects in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations by and approval from the National Bioethics Committee in Cyprus (EEBK/EΠ/2011/07) and all samples were processed as previously described

 </sup>. An informed consent has been obtained from each participating study subject. The newly obtained sequences were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers MK682535-MK682555 for the Core-E1 region and MK682556-MK682575 for the NS5B region). Additionally, HCV sequences (N = 221) from the general population and high-risk cohorts from our previously published HCV molecular epidemiological studies in Cyprus were also used in the phylogeographic analyses
