Previous molecular epidemiology studies suggest the presence of multiple subtypes among Cypriot subjects. To investigate HCV genotype- and subtype-specific dissemination patterns, origins, and transmission in Cyprus, we analyzed HCV sequences encoding partial Core-E1 and NS5B regions. Analyzed populations comprised the general population and high-risk cohorts in Cyprus and a globally sampled dataset. Maximum-likelihood phylogeny reconstruction with bootstrap evaluation, character reconstruction using parsimony, and bootstrap trees estimated by ML were performed to identify the geographic origin of HCV subtypes and statistically significant dispersal pathways among geographic regions. Phylogeographic analyses traced the origin of subtypes in the general population and among PWID in Cyprus to unique and overlapping globally distributed regions. Phylogenetic analysis in Core-E1 revealed that most sequences from incarcerated populations in Cyprus clustered with the general population and PWID. We estimate that HCV infections in Cyprus originate from multiple global sources while most HCV transmissions among incarcerated individuals occur locally. This analysis is one of a few studies tracing HCV dispersal patterns using global datasets, and these practices and findings should inform how HCV epidemics are targeted by future prevention policies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Hepatitis C</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003448</institution-id><institution>General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oikonomopoulou</surname><given-names>Martha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, giving rise to a major public health issue on a global scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It is a highly genetically diverse single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus in the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The prevalence of Hepatitis C virus globally has been estimated to be approximately 180 million infections. HCV is phylogenetically classified into 7 major genotypes (clades) and 57 subtypes (subclades)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Geographic origin and transmission risk category influence the global distribution of HCV genotypes and subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Previous estimates reported that genotype 1 was the most prevalent (46.2%), followed by 3a (30.1%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Genotypes 2, 4, and 6 account for most of the remaining infections with prevalences estimated at 9.1%, 8.3%, and 5.4%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Genotype 5 was estimated at &#x0003c;1%. Genotypes 1 and 3 have been found globally, whereas genotypes 4 and 5 occur mostly in low-income countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Genotype 1 circulates at highest prevalence in the Americas, Central Europe, and a few countries in Asia; genotype 2 in Western Africa; genotype 3 in Central Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe; genotype 4 in North Africa, Central Africa, and the Middle East; genotype 5 in Southern Africa; and genotype 6 in Eastern and Southeast Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, the origin of HCV and the global patterns of HCV dissemination remain unknown.</p><p id="Par4">Our previous molecular epidemiology studies suggested that among Cypriot subjects, 1b and 3a were the most predominant subtypes, followed by 1a. Specifically, 3a was the most prevalent (57%) among people who inject drugs (PWID) and 1b among the general population. For people who inject drugs, the 2k/1b recombinant type that has been previously described in Russia was also detected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.The global distribution of subtypes 1a and 1b has likely been shaped by the dissemination of blood and blood products after the Second World War<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, while the distribution of genotype 3 is likely a result of the mobility of PWID and drug trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In Cyprus, HCV infection from intravenous drug use is associated with each prevalent subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

This ratio provides a measure of the amount of viral flow between different countries or subgroups that is not attributed to chance. For example, a ratio of 0.70 suggests that the observed viral flow across the pathway is 30% lower than what is expected from chance while a ratio of 1.30 suggests a 30% higher viral flow than the expected. Such ratios are sensitive to the mean, as expected events with a mean close to &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; may produce high ratio values.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Nucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers</title><p id="Par12">The accession numbers for HCV sequences obtained in the molecular epidemiology study (2011&#x02013;2012) of intravenous drug-users attending therapy in Cyprus and submitted to GenBank are MK682535-MK682555 for the Core-E1 region (21 sequences) and MK682556-MK682575 for the NS5B region (20 sequences).

Based on these patterns of incoming and outgoing viral mobility, Cyprus was received subtype 1a infections and provided limited subsequent dispersal to other locations. The USA was not among the source areas for subtype 1a to Cyprus. To further confirm the inferred pattern for the non-importing nature of the epidemic from the USA, phylogeographic analysis after a random down sampling of references from the USA was repeated. Two sampling rounds down to 20% and 10% of the US sequences were performed while the rest of the dataset was stable.

These results were compared to the analysis of HCV infection within the general population (i.e. low risk group) in Cyprus. All analyses were only conducted for subtypes 1b and 3a which were almost exclusively the subtypes identified in these high-risk groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Phylogenetic analysis for subtype 3a sequences in the Core-E1 region revealed that most HCV sequences from incarcerated individuals (5 out of 7, 71%) clustered with sequences from the general population and PWID from Cyprus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Specifically, 4 of them (57%) grouped together with PWID sequences and 1 showed close phylogenetic relationship with single isolates from both the general population and PWID. While the exact origin of the latter sequence cannot be identified, a plausible hypothesis is that it originated from an PWID. A single case fell within a monophyletic group of five sequences from PWID in Cyprus (group I). The branch lengths of the whole group were very short suggesting a recent origin of HCV transmissions within the group.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic tree.

They fell within a monophyletic group of sequences (group II) sampled from Cyprus, Uzbekistan and Belarus. The majority of sequences from Cyprus within group II (7 out of 13, 54%) were from PWID; four were from the general population and two were from the target group. The remaining non-Cypriot sequences (collected from Uzbekistan) were also from PWID, while this specific demographic information from Belarus was not available. Given that the majority of strains within group II belonged to sequences from PWID, the most plausible hypothesis is that the putative origin of infection for the two incarcerated individuals was due to transmission from an PWID or drug paraphernalia. These findings were also confirmed in NS5B where identical phylogenetic clustering between sequences from incarcerated individuals and PWID from different areas was detected.</p><p id="Par23">Similar analyses for subtype 1b (Core-E1), revealed that three out of four sequences from the target group (75%) clustered directly with PWID strains from Cyprus, although the putative origin of the last infection could not be identified. One sequence from incarcerated individuals fell within a cluster of three sequences from PWID connected with short branches. Phylogenetic analysis in NS5B confirmed only the clustering for the one sequence from among incarcerated individuals. This may be due to the larger number of references included in the NS5B region. Based on findings in Core-E1, the putative origin of most HCV transmissions among the incarcerated population is likely from PWID although from less evidence than for subtype 3a. While HCV sequences from incarcerated individuals sometimes group with the general population, the results in both the Core-E1 and NS5B regions suggest close phylogenetic relationships with PWID in subtypes 1b and 3a on an increasingly global scale.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par24">This study used phylogeographic analysis to investigate the origins of HCV transmission to and from Cyprus and trace the global origin and dynamics of infections among incarcerated individuals in Cyprus. Among the observed HCV subtypes, phylogeographic analysis revealed a diverse pattern of viral mobility between Cyprus and other countries. In subtype 1b, which is the dominant clade among the general population, HCV transmissions to Cyprus originated from globally distributed countries in the Americas, Oceania, Southeastern Asia, and Europe. Cyprus was also a source for outgoing international 1b subtype transmissions across a broad geographical range. These observations suggest the bidirectional nature of the viral mobility of HCV subtype 1b in analyses of both the Core-E1 and NS5B region. Similar bidirectional viral mobility was indicated by analyses of the 3a subtype. However, analyses indicated that Cyprus was rarely a source of subtype 1a transmissions to other countries as it was a sink for viral transmission of this subtype. This finding is likely a result of the low prevalence of this subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">Aggregately, the observed subtypes transmitted to Cyprus had origins in four continents, suggesting a complex transmission dynamic with trans-continental characteristics. HCV transmission occurred from the Americas and Western Europe, but also notably from Eastern Europe, Asia, and Oceania. These dynamics are like a result of Cyprus&#x02019; close ties with both Eastern and Western Europe in addition to its geographic location as a crossroads of three continents. No transmission to or from Africa was observed regarding to Cyprus despite their geographic proximity. While African countries have high prevalences of multiple HCV genotypes, these genotypes have demonstrated minimal transcontinental distribution and since African data is often not well documented and sequence data is likely not as readily available in online repositories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, the geographically widespread sequence data that is currently available is still useful for understanding the phylogeographic trends of HCV and elucidating the difference distribution and movement patterns among the subtypes.</p><p id="Par26">Currently, the distribution of HCV clades (genotypes and subtypes) differs greatly across geographic areas and between transmission risk groups (e.g. PWID, blood transfusion recipients, the general population, etc.). This suggests that viral dissemination has followed distinct patterns across the globe and has been shaped by these specific factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In the current study, it was found that HCV dispersal in Cyprus follows complex subtype-specific transcontinental patterns, reinforcing the trend of risk factors being associated with subtype transmission.</p><p id="Par27">Although modern transmission patterns are becoming better understood, it is not known when HCV developed within animal populations and how the disease spread to humans. It is likely that the genotypes of HCV arose in humans at different timeframes and have spread at different rates with varying geographic distributions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The exponential growth of the epidemic in the human population began in the 1940s as a result of the widespread transfusion of blood and blood products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Later the virus also began to spread more extensively due to intravenous drug use, drug trafficking, and human movement. Some specific transmission mechanisms are now associated with individual subtypes. The viral migration patterns of subtype 3a can likely be explained by the movement of drug trafficking and PWID, since the subtype primarily circulates among PWID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. While the transmission of subtypes 1b, 2a, and 2b are often linked to iatrogenic causes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, the dynamics driving movement of subtypes 1a and 1b within the scope of this study are more difficult to account for and merit further work on intra- and transnational transmission.</p><p id="Par28">This study is one among few to trace the viral mobility into and out of a specific country using a global reference dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In Scotland, it was shown that HCV subtype 1a and 3a sequences formed distinct clusters located between reference sequences from different sampled areas. Similarly, subtype 1a and subtype 1b sequences from Greece were dispersed across a globally constructed tree<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and levels of transmission networking among PWID were higher for subtype 3a than 1a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Although few studies of this sort have been conducted, trends of HCV dissemination generally follow more distinct patterns than the HIV-1 pandemic, where most transmissions in the Western world were due to a single clade (subtype B), which originated in the Caribbean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The greater complexity of the dissemination of HCV than of HIV-1 is likely due to differences in the epidemiology of the pathogens. HCV has infected humans for a longer time and over a wider geographic distribution prior to its exponential growth than HIV-1. Different transmission routes and factors related to the host response in humans likely also shape how the viruses have distinctly spread. The results of this study suggest that subtype-specific HCV transmission patterns exist within not only within Cyprus but also between Cyprus and widely globally distributed countries. Additional studies are needed to better understand the spatial characteristics and factors that have and will shape the global HCV epidemic.</p><p id="Par29">While this study examined a broad group of individuals with HCV, incarcerated individuals and PWID were populations of note, given the high-risk of HCV among them. While phylogeographic analysis was used to trace transnational patterns of transmission, it also revealed the dispersal patterns among these populations in Cyprus. Within the incarcerated population, newest infections arose from PWID already within Cyprus. These findings indicate a shared subtype within these populations, suggesting how certain risk factors can predispose to infection by a specific subtype. Highlighting this finding, two incarcerated individuals displayed evidence of a common source of infection within a cluster of PWID from Cyprus and other areas, reinforcing trends between countries and risk groups. These results were robust across a variety of genotypes. This suggests that injections of intravenous drugs pose a risk for HCV transmission among incarcerated individuals. Responding to these transmission trends, HCV prevention should be intensified and target this high-risk group with risk-appropriate measures such as volunteer testing for HCV and treatment using the direct acting antivirals (DAAs) against HCV.</p><p id="Par30">Using state of the art phylogeographic methods, this study analysed the movement and dissemination of the major HCV subtypes in Cyprus (1a, 1b, and 3a) to answer two questions: what are the global geographic patterns of HCV transmission into and out of Cyprus and what are the patterns of transmission among the general and high-risk populations within Cyprus? To frame the both elements of the work within a maximally comprehensive global context, the analyses included all sequences available on public databases as references. Given the large number of sequences analyzed, statistical phylogeography was used due to the long computation time required for Bayesian methods. One of the potential limitations in this study is the lack of available HCV sequences from many geographic locations. To improve the analytical capacity of the existing data, inferences were performed in 2 different partial genomic regions (Core-E1 and NS5B) and merged migration events from both regions. This study highlights the complexity of HCV dissemination within, into, and out of Cyprus. While the movement of HCV does not follow a specific pattern like the HIV-1 epidemic, Cyprus, as an island at the geographic crossroads of three continents, is a powerful place to begin unraveling the intricacies of the patterns of global HCV transmission. This complexity likely reflects the different routes for HCV epidemic transmission and dispersal, including blood and blood product transfusions, iatrogenic transmissions, and drug injections. Because these transmission mechanisms are often associated with different subtypes, phylogeographic analysis is a powerful tool for mapping how and where HCV subtypes are transmitted. As more sequences are made available from wider geographic regions, phylogeographic analysis will more effectively describe the complex patterns of the dissemination of HCV and other viral diseases so more informed approaches can be made to combatting these epidemics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>
