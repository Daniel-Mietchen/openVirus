 <p>Plant DNA viruses of the genus 
  <italic>Begomovirus</italic> have been documented as the most genetically diverse in the family 
  <italic>Geminiviridae</italic> and present a serious threat for global horticultural production, especially considering climate change. It is important to characterize naturally existing begomoviruses, since viral genetic diversity in non-cultivated plants could lead to future disease epidemics in crops. In this study, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was employed to determine viral diversity of samples collected in a survey performed during 2012â€“2016 in seven states of Northern-Pacific Mexico, areas of diverse climatic conditions where different vegetable crops are subject to intensive farming. In total, 132 plant species, belonging to 34 families, were identified and sampled in the natural ecosystems surrounding cultivated areas (agro-ecological interface). HTS analysis and subsequent 
  <italic>de novo</italic> assembly revealed a number of geminivirus-related DNA signatures with 80 to 100% DNA similarity with begomoviral sequences present in the genome databank. The analysis revealed DNA signatures corresponding to 52 crop-infecting and 35 non-cultivated-infecting geminiviruses that, interestingly, were present in different plant species. Such an analysis deepens our knowledge of geminiviral diversity and could help detecting emerging viruses affecting crops in different agro-climatic regions.
