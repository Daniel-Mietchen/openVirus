<p>It is a well accepted notion that non-cultivated (wild) host plants play a key role in the generation of viral genetic variation, maintaining a certain degree of sequence heterogeneity convenient for viral adaptation in nature, without altering essential consensus sequences. Only recently, metagenomics studies on non-cultivated plant species have attracted the attention of plant researchers [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], to date the knowledge of geminivirus distribution in Mexican natural ecosystems is still limited. To this purpose, we aimed to determine the genetic diversity of begomoviruses in non-cultivated species that are present in the vicinity of cultivated crops (designated as the agro-ecological interface) in Northern-Pacific Mexico. In the present study, rolling circle amplification (RCA) was applied to DNA samples from wild plant species obtained during a five-year survey, and several begomoviral DNA signatures and begomoviral sequences were identified. Our results support the presence of a niche for begomoviral evolution in the neighborhood of important cultivation areas in Northern-Pacific Mexico.
