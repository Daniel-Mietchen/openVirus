<p>It has been proposed that global warming will influence the epidemiology of virus-related plant diseases, mainly due to alterations in the distribution of insect vectors and in their host range [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The viral quasispecies (non-identical but related genomes) present in a host plant could be generated by recombinant genomes providing an improved fitness potential to the viruses that may subsequently initiate an infection in new host species, or cause more severe disease symptoms in an established host by overcoming plant resistance. The generation of quasispecies depends on the host-virus interaction, the environmental conditions, and the cultivation practices [
