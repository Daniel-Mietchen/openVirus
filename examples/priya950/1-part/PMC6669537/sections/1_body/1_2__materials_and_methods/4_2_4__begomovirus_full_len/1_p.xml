<p>Full-length geminiviral genomes were obtained following a previously described protocol [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In brief, the total DNA (100 ng) from selected non-cultivated plants was used as a template for viral circular DNA genome enrichment by RCA, as mentioned above. To obtain the viral monomeric full-length genomes, the RCA products were digested with a selected a single-site restriction enzyme (BamHI, EcoRI, XbaI, or XhoI, depending on the virus under analysis). The expected linearized geminivirus full-length genomes (~2.7 kb) were recovered from 1% ultrapure agarose gels using PureLink Quick Gel Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer´s instructions. The fragments were ligated into linearized pGreen 0029 plasmid [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] that was digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes. The resulting recombinant plasmids were transformed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α, and positive clones were subjected to Sanger genome walking sequencing. Genome assemblies were obtained using SeqMan (DNASTARInc, Madison, WI, USA) and SnapGene (GLS Biotech LLC, Chicago, IL, USA) software. All pairwise comparisons were performed using the MUSCLE algorithm implemented in Mega 7 [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree(s) were constructed on both begomoviral DNA components, with a 1000 bootstrap on both components to assess branch support. To analyze the nucleotide and amino acid identity, open reading frames (ORFs) were separated and individually compared with highest match homologous genome of each virus obtained from NCBI databank, using the ClustalW algorithm implemented in Mega 7.
