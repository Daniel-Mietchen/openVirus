<p>The evolution of plant viruses is a complex process involving multiple ecological and genetic factors resulting in host-pathogen co-evolution. Studies on viral diversity have been documented in a wide number of non-cultivated plants, with new entries described either as different strains of existing viruses or as new viruses [

 <xref rid="B106-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. However, it is noteworthy that viral species are often co-infecting the same plants with the possibility of genetic interaction, giving raise to inter- or intra-specific recombinant viruses resulting in more severe strains, as in the case of cassava mosaic diseases (CMD) [

 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] and tomato yellow curl diseases (TYLCD) [

 <xref rid="B108-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Plant disease emergence requires that a virus from a reservoir host invades a new host resulting in new infection dynamics and viral adaptation [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. In this sense, some geminiviruses acquired the ability to form a complex disease by assorting DNA A and B genomes, like ACMV and EACMV in Uganda [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] or those cases where the DNA A genome is similar to bipartite begomoviruses but the DNA B has not yet been described, such as TChLPV and ToSLCV in Mexico [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] or 
 <italic>Datura leaf curl virus</italic> (DaLCV) in Sudan [
 <xref rid="B110-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. In the present work, the geminiviral diversity was described in different Mexican regions, showing that TYLCV, SiMSinV, PHYVV, RhGMV and RhGMSV are the predominant viruses. In addition, different multiviral complexes were detected in several plant species, highlighting the high frequency of mixed infections detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00594-f003">Figure 3</xref>). However, a relevant issue is the wide host range observed for these viruses and that the genetic structure of the virome could be modified in an unpredictable manner. Moving forward, work is in progress aiming to determine whether new viruses or strains constitute a potential risk for Mexican agriculture.
