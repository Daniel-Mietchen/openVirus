<p>Ecogenomic analyses of begomovirus were accomplished by sequence-specific PCR detection including PHYVV, TYLCV, SiMSiV, and RhGMV/RhGMSV as the most widely distributed species in Northern-Pacific Mexico (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00594">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The analysis revealed that TYLCV was detected in 89 plants, emerging as the predominant virus, followed by SiMSiV, RhGMV/RhGMSV, and PHYVV with 63, 62, and 46 detections, respectively. Moreover, the number of single infections were lower, namely the observed corresponded to TYLCV (13.54%) followed by SiMSiV and RhGMV/RhGMSV (3.12 and 1.04%, respectively), suggesting that single infection is not common (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00594-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The most common double viral infection detected was TYLCV-SiMSiV (14.58%), while TYLCV-SiMSiV-RhGMV/RhGMSV (11.45%) and TYLCV-PHYVV-RhGMV/RhGMSV (10.4%) were the most common triple infections. Furthermore, quadruple infections with TYLCV-PHYVV-SiMSiV-RhGMV/RhGMSV (31.25%) represented the highest viral complex found in different plant species and in the five agroecological regions included in these study (
