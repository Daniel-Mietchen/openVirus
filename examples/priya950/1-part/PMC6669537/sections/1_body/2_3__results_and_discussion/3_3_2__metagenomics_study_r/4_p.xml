<p>The genus 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic> comprises the most common DNA viruses responsible for several virus-associated plant diseases in Mexico. Among them PHYVV, an endemic virus, and PepGMV have been documented as the most widespread and predominant in pepper crops [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the introduction of the promiscuous TYLCV in Yucatán and later in Sinaloa states, with a dramatic impact on crop yield, became the major concern for tomato crops in Northern Mexico [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Interestingly, TYLCV did not exclude the “native” viruses, and its co-infection with PHYVV or PepGMV caused severe disease in pepper crops [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, the presence of such viruses in non-cultivated plants, as alternative hosts in nature, increases the chances of viral evolution through recombination events or other mechanisms, representing a latent threat. In fact, a new isolate of PHYVV described in pepper had significant sequence changes on its DNA B genome, which confers a modified host range since this isolate was able to infect tomato plants causing severe symptoms [

 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The other invasive virus which was introduced in Sonora state, apparently from the Middle East, was WmCSV [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and it was detected in the present study along with SLCV. Our results suggest that WmCSV and SLCV are present in non-cultivated plants collected in Coahuila-Durango region (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00594-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), which implies that WmCSV virus has the potential to spread in Mexico, and by adapting to new environments it has the potential to initiate an emerging disease in a new region. It is important to mention that both viruses could interact in mixed infection inducing more severe symptoms on crops as reported in Jordan [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The detection of ToChLPV, ToSLCV, OYMMV, BCaMV, and BYMMV, that were reported previously in Mexico, indicate that they still occupy an ecological niche and could be a potential source of viral disease. The identification of SiMSiV and RhGMV in all regions sampled is intriguing. Perhaps both of them represent viruses that are well adapted to different hosts and environments with a potential risk to evolve into an emerging disease. SiMSinV was initially reported in Sinaloa state associated to 
 <italic>Sida rombifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] without a negative impact on crops described to date. On the other hand, RhGMV was previously reported as the cause of disease in tobacco and soybean [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is well known that viruses adapted to non-cultivated plants do not normally induce disease symptoms in their hosts. Nonetheless, SiMSiV and RhGMV induce symptoms in their corresponding first reported hosts (
 <italic>Sida rombifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhyncosia minima,</italic> respectively), with different wild species (acting as reservoirs) being suspected as the origin of the inoculum. Moreover, EuMV and EuYMV were reported previously in 
 <italic>Euphorbia heterophylla</italic> in Mexico and Brazil [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]; whereas BlelCV, is a novel virus recently described in Chiapas state [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, the ChiLCV, PepLRV, ToYSV, PYMV, CabLCV, SPLCV, MaBYMV, and ViYMV geminivirus-related signatures have not been previously described and/or associated to disease in Mexico and represent potential strains and/or novel viruses whose biological role needs to be determined in the immediate future. It is worth mentioning that viruses like ChilCV, PepLRV, and ToYSV are already associated with pepper, bean, and tomato diseases in Pakistan, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil [
