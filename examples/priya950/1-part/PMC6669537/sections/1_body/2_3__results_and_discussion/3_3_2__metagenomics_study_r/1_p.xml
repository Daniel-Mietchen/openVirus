<p>Following the pipeline described in the Materials and Methods section, NGS resulted in 16 to 215 million reads for the five libraries. After human, bacteria, plant, and eukaryotic virus sequence depletion, an NCBI-GenBank database search was performed to identify the most closely related geminivirus sequences, obtaining between 6000 and 4.6 million reads (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00594-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Subsequent annotation showed that more than 99% of the reads correspond to the genus 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic>, and the remaining 1% matches the 
 <italic>Geminiviridae</italic> genera 
 <italic>Curtovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Becurtovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Turncurtovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Topocuvirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Mastrevirus</italic>. No sequences with homology to genera 
 <italic>Capulavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Eragrovirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Grablovirus</italic> were identified in our study. The genus 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic> has been reported previously as the most widely distributed in Mexico [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]; in addition, sporadic reports on other genera like 
 <italic>Curtovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Grablovirus</italic> were described [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Our data pointed out the abundance and importance of the genus 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic> in Mexico; however, follow up studies of the other genera are imperative.
