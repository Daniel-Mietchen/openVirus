<p>Phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide alignment with selected begomoviruses from the GenBank database, are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00594-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The results show that TYLCV isolate LV15-Ng-04 from 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> cluster together with different TYLCV isolates from different regions of the world, and segregate more closely to Mexican and Asian isolates (Israel and China) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00594-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). These data are in agreement with the TYLCV classification by geographic area, where Asian and American isolates are placed in Group I [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. SiMSiV is a 
 <italic>Malvaceae</italic>-infecting virus, whereas RhGMV and RhGMSV are 
 <italic>Fabaceae</italic>-infecting viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SiMSiV (DNA A and B) isolated from 
 <italic>S. acute</italic> is closely related to an isolate of SiMSiV from Sinaloa state (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00594-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,C). Similarly, isolates of RhGMV (DNA A and B) isolated from 
 <italic>R. minima</italic> is clustered with isolates previously reported from soybean and weeds from Sinaloa state (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00594-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,C). Altogether, the HTS analysis strongly suggests the existence of biologically active viruses in the agro-ecological interface with the potential of developing novel or emerging crop diseases. Finally, infectious clones of TYLCV, SiMSiV, RhGMV and RhGMSV were also obtained (to be described elsewhere).
