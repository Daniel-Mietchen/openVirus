<p>As large granular lymphocytes representing about 10% of lung resident lymphocytes, NK cells accumulate in the respiratory tract in response to IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. This increase correlates with an initial decrease in circulatory NK cells [
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>] suggesting that during early IAV infection NK cells are recruited directly from blood [
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). NK cell recruitment to the site of infection depends on expression of chemokine receptors, namely, CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR3 [
