<p>Epithelial cytopathology is a principal outcome of IAV infection of the respiratory tract which NK cells can mitigate through IL-22 production [

 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>] respond to IL-22 through epithelial regeneration which reduces inflammation [

 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>] may be an immune evasion strategy empoyed by IAV. Since the full spectrum of interaction between NK cells and IAV is yet to be elucidated, additional studies that focus on NK cells are warranted.
