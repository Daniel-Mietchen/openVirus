<p>Primary effector functions (cytolysis of infected cells and cytokine secretion [
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]) of IAV-stimulated NK cells are facilitated through cytotoxic receptors, NKp46, NKp44, and NKp30, of which viral HA binds directly to sialic acids expressed on NKp46 [

 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>], suggesting that the difference in receptor binding preference of the infecting virus differentially regulates NK cell activation. Cytolysis of IAV-infected cells is achieved by degranulation and release of perforin and granzyme, as well as by lytic activity of IFN
