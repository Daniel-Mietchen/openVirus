<p>Following IAV infection, pDCs produce large amounts of chemoattractants, importantly CXCL1, CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10 [
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Mice selectively depleted of pDCs exhibited delayed recruitment of T cells into airways [
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>] suggesting that they regulate accumulation of T cells during early IAV infection. The ability of pDCs to support IAV replication is dose dependent [
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]; susceptibility observed with higher multiplicity of infections (MOIs) [
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] might not correlate with infection in humans. Since, at lower MOIs, pDCs do not support IAV replication [
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], they fail to prime CD4
 <sup>+</sup> or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells directly [
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. However, pDCs can uptake IAV antigens from virus-infected cells and upregulate CCR7 expression in response [
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>] suggesting that they too can migrate to DLNs and cross-present acquired IAV antigens. During IAV infection, pDCs induce differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells through IFN
 <italic>Î±</italic> and IL-6 [
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>] and the depletion of pDCs abrogates antibody secretion [
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. The activation of lung-resident B cells during pH1N1 infection [
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>] may be led by these DC subsets that encounter viral antigen thereby providing dual protection at the site of infection as well as by couriering a call for help (
