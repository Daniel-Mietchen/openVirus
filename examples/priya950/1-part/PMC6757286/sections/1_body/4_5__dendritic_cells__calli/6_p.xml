<p>As with most factors of the immune response, moderation is required for health and excessive cytokine levels can be detrimental to the host. Highly pathogenic H5N1 virus-infected pDCs produce higher amounts of IFN
 <italic>α</italic> than those infected with less virulent seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 strains [
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. While IFN
 <italic>α</italic> secreted from pDCs does have antiviral functions [

 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), prolific production during IAV infection results in uncontrolled inflammation and host pathology [
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], alluding that pDCs may also contribute to the cytokine storm during infection. As an antithesis to sublethal IAV infection, lethal infection causes the accumulation of pDCs in DLNs with enhanced expression of Fas ligand (FasL) [
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>] which engages with Fas, a membrane protein of the death receptor family [
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>] expressed on IAV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells eliminating them via Fas-mediated apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Conversely, since IAV infection in pDC-depleted mice leads to enhanced accumulation of inflammatory cells, particularly CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs and macrophages which produce massive amounts of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6) [
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>], pDCs may be important immunoregulators during lethal IAV infection. The protective versus deleterious effect of pDCs depends on the infectious dose.
