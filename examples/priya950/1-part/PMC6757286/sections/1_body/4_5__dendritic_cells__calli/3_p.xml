<p>Compared to other DC subsets, CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs are highly efficient at viral antigen uptake and migration to DLNs [
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>] and are the most efficient cross-presenters of the immune system [
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] as they differ in their antigen processing and presentation capabilities [
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. While CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs process and present IAV antigens to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells efficiently [
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], IAV-activated CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs fail to prime CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This might be related to the ability of these cells to support IAV replication 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic>; CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs support productive IAV infection while CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs do not [
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>], providing an explanation for CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cDC's superior antigen-presenting capacity. However, whether CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cDCs support IAV replication 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> is unclear with data suggesting that viral antigen is acquired through phagocytosis instead to allow cross-presentation to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>].
