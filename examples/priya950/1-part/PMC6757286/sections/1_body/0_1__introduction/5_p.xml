<p>Infected airway epithelial cells trigger innate immune responses in two ways. First, viral RNAs within infected cells are sensed by pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors, or retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I like receptors. Signaling through these receptors induces the production of antiviral soluble factors, including interferons (IFNs), which act on adjacent healthy cells in a paracrine manner to trigger antiviral gene transcription. Activation of mediators like protein kinase R, 2′5′-oligoadenylate synthetase, RNaseL, cleavage and polyadenylation factor [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in otherwise healthy cells induces an antiviral state thereby limiting viral replication [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. IFNs also induce expression of interferon-stimulated genes (like myxovirus-1) that have strong anti-influenza activity [

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to contain viral spread. However, the production of inflammatory cytokines is not always protective as cytokine storms arise when they are secreted in excess as observed during HPAI H5N1 virus infection [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] often leading to severe pneumonia and death. Secondly, phagocytosis of infected cells by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) can activate adaptive immune responses [
