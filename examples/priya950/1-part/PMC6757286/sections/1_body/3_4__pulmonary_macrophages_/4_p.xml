<p>Owing to the contribution of AMs in maintaining lung tissue integrity and pulmonary homeostasis, their role in protecting AECs from IAV-induced damage is important. Type I AECs are responsible for gas exchange, and their impairment during infection leads to pulmonary dysfunction. On the other hand, type II AECs can self-renew or divide to replenish damaged type I AECs [

 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] suggesting a critical role for AMs as regulators of wound healing and tissue repair upon IAV infection.
