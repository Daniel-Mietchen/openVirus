<p>Although monocytes provide immunoprotection against IAV infection, excessive infiltration of monocytes can induce immunopathology and mice exhibiting uncontrolled IAV replication have excessive monocyte recruitment into the lungs [

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice demonstrate increased survival following IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>–
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], suggesting that monocytes can drive IAV-induced host pathology. Moreover, disease severity correlates with increased monocyte-derived cytokines [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] which in turn leads to immunopathology. Overall, the role in immune protection or pathology is determined by the number of infiltrating monocytes and the cytokine milieu.
