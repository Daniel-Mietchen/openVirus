<p>Monocytes, peripheral blood phagocytes, are recruited into the lungs during IAV infection. Based on cell surface receptors, CD14 and CD16, circulating human monocytes can be subdivided into three distinct subsets: classical (CD14
 <sup>++</sup>/CD16
 <sup>−</sup>), intermediate (CD14
 <sup>++</sup>/CD16
 <sup>+</sup>), and nonclassical (CD14
 <sup>+</sup>/CD16
 <sup>++</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>–
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Compared to peripheral circulation (where classical monocytes are predominant), intermediate monocytes predominate in airways [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Similarly, murine monocytes (CD11b
 <sup>+</sup>CD115
 <sup>+</sup>) are divided into three subsets based on the expression of Ly6C as classical (Ly6C
 <sup>++</sup>), intermediate (Ly6C
 <sup>+</sup>), and nonclassical (Ly6C
 <sup>−</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].
