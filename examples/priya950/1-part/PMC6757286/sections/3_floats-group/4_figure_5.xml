  <p>Yin and Yang of innate immune cell functions during influenza virus infection. At steady state, innate immune cells corporate to maintain pulmonary homeostasis while clearing IAV effectively with minimal tissue damage. When infected with a highly pathogenic virus or when immediate immune responses are unable to clear the infection, the immune system goes on overdrive causing excessive proinflammatory cytokine production and uncontrolled inflammation which can be pathogenic and detrimental to the host.</p>
