  <p>Schematic representation of neutrophil-mediated host defense mechanisms during influenza virus infection. Influenza A virus- (IAV)-infected airway epithelium releases neutrophil chemoattractants: CXCL1 and CXCL2. Neutrophils traffic into infected lungs by digesting endothelial basement membrane collagen. During trafficking, they release CXCL12-loaded vesicles/membranes which provide signals for CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell migration and effector function. Once in the lungs, neutrophils secrete antimicrobial peptides and cytokines, including IFN
   <italic>γ</italic>, to inhibit IAV replication. TNF
   <italic>α</italic> produced by infected airway epithelium triggers the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) which neutralize IAV particles. Enhanced NETosis damages airway epithelium and endothelium leading to severe pneumonia.
