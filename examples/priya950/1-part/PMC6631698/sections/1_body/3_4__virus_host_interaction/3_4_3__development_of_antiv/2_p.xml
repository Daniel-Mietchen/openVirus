<p>The design and development of effective antiviral therapeutics rely on virology and immunology understanding of EV-D68. The crystal structure of it was revealed by Liu et al., and they also showed that pleconaril, the capsid binding anti-rhinovirus compound, has the ability to inhibit EV-D68 at a half-maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 430nM, therefore making it a potential drug candidate for EV-D68 [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] reported the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of three EV-D68 capsid states, the procapsid, mature virion, and A-particle, which represent the major phases of the virus. They further described two original monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 15C5 and 11G1, that inhibit EV-D68 infection with distinct binding properties and neutralizing mechanisms. The A-particle is selectively bound by 11G1, whereas 15C5 binds and triggers mature virions to transform into classical A-particles, mimicking host receptor interactions and thereby neutralizing viral infection. Both mAbs exhibit protective efficacy in vivo. Moreover, mAb A6-1, isolated from an EV-D68-infected Rhesus macaque (

The illustration of EV-D68 structure and the discovery of mAbs provide for a structure-based approach to the development of EV-D68 vaccines and therapeutic interventions and also provide a tool for further investigating the biological features and virus–host interaction mechanisms of EV-D68.
