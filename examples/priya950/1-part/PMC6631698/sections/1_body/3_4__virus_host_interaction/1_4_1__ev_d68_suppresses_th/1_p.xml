<p>During viral infection, host cells develop various strategies to prevent viral invasion, but viruses have also evolved complex mechanisms to escape and antagonize this host defense. To some extent, the interaction between host and virus is an important factor in determining the course of an infection. The innate immune system is critical to the host’s resistance to viral infection, acting as the first-line physical and chemical barrier to infectious pathogens. When host cells are challenged by pathogenic microbes, different pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by the host cells can recognize viral components through the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of viruses or other pathogens and subsequently trigger intracellular signaling cascades to activate proinflammatory responses [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These responses lead to the secretion of interferons (IFN) via autocrine and paracrine pathways, stimulating IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that can induce an antiviral state in infected host cells [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A TLR3-TRIF mediated signaling pathway recruits downstream TRAF3 and interacts with IKK-related kinase TBK1/IKKε complexes, resulting in the phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Phosphorylated IRF-3 dimerizes and is translocated to the nucleus, where it induces the production of type I IFN [
