<p>Xiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have reported that 3C(pro) cleaves TRIF at its amino- (Q312) and carboxyl-terminal (Q653) domains, leading to a loss of TRIF’s capacity to activate NF-κB and IFN-β signaling and thus helping enteroviruses to subvert host immune responses. These investigators also found that EV-D68 inhibits host viral immunity by downregulating interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). Furthermore, the process strictly requires 3C(pro) to cleave Q167 and Q189 within the constitutive activation domain of IRF7, preventing IRF7 from activating type I interferon expression to limit viral replication [

In our recent studies, we have discovered that 3C(pro) from EV-D68 specifically binds the amino terminus of melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MAD5) and inhibits its interplay with MAVS, consequently blocking MDA5-triggered IFN signaling in the (RLR) pathway [

On the other hand, 3C(pro) also mediates the cleavage of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1(TAK1), leading to the suppression of NF-κB activation, a host response crucial for toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated signaling. The latest research shows that 2A (pro) acts as a “security protein” of enteroviruses by strongly inhibiting stress granule (SG) formation and IFN-β gene transcription in all human EV species (EV-A to EV-D) [
