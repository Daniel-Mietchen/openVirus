<p>The existence of sialic acid on the surface of human respiratory tract endothelial cells may be the reason for the effective replication of EV-D68, which leads to infection of the respiratory system. The modification of sialic acid is also critical for EV-D68 infection, and protein glycosylation in the secretory pathway plays an important role in viral invasion. However, apart from sialylated receptors, some strains of EV-D68 are reported to use an alternative nonsialylated receptor [

The dependence of US/MO/14-18947 (MO) and US/KY/14-18953(KY), the circulating strains in the 2014 United States EV-D68 epidemic, on sialic acid was decreased during viral infection, and these strains were resistant to neuraminidase treatment, pointing to the existence of another vital protein receptor(s) that might mediate the entry and invasion of EV-D68 into host cells [
