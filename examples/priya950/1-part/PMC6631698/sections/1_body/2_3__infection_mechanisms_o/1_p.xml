<p>Unlike other enteroviruses, which are acid-resistant and replicate in the human gastrointestinal tract, EV-D68 displays acid lability, prefers a lower growth temperature, and multiplies in the respiratory tract; these are also characteristic features of human rhinoviruses. Thus, EV-D68 shares important biological and molecular properties with both the enteroviruses and rhinoviruses [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, Vero cells are non-permissive for EV-D68 infection, suggesting that DAF is not likely to be the receptor for EV-D68. Liu et al. have demonstrated that cell-surface sialic acid supports the infection of susceptible cells with EV-D68. Crystal structures of EV-D68 in complex with sialylated glycan receptor analogs suggest that the virus binds within the “canyon,” a depression on the surface of the virion, and induces a cascade of conformational changes that eject a fatty-acid-like molecule that regulates the stability of the virus, thereby initiating viral uncoating and cell entry [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Glycan array analysis has shown that EV-D68 strains preferably bind to α2-6-linked sialic acids (α2-6 SAs) as opposed to α2-3 SAs [
