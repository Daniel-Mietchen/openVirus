<p>According to surveillance by the CDC, between August and December, 2014, coincident with the national outbreak of EV-D68, 120 cases of AFM were diagnosed. The incidence of AFM in California grew from baseline (0.028 cases) to 0.16 cases per 100,000 people each year, and EV-D68 was the most common virus detected in the upper respiratory tract specimens from individuals with AFM [
