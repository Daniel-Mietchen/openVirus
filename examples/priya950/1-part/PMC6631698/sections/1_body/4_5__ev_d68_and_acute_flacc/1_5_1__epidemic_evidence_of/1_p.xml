<p>Except for its respiratory and febrile symptoms, EV-D68 infection is reported to have an association with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), a neurological disorder. In some cases, it can produce symptoms of acute limb weakness, even paralysis, with distinctive abnormalities of the central spinal cord apparent in magnetic resonance imaging [

In 2012, a total of 23 cases of AFP (mostly children and young adults) in California were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). EV-D68 was detected in the respiratory specimens of 2 of the 19 available specimens [

In the summer and fall of 2014 and 2016, EV-D68 circulated and caused a nationwide viral outbreak in the United States, and the number of cases of AFP also increased significantly during this period. In contrast, the occurrence of AFM in 2016, when EV-D68 was not prevalent, was relatively rare [
