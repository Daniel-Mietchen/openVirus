<p>Four strains from the 2014 outbreak, US/MO/14-18947(MO), US/KY/14-18953(KY), US/IL/14-18952(IL), and US/CA/14-4232(CA), were found to be able to induce a paralytic disease in mice resembling human AFM, whereas EV-D68 prototype strains Fermon and Rhyne could not [

EV-D68 infection was able to cause a loss of spinal cord motor neurons, and a virus isolated from the spinal cords of infected mice could transmit the disease to naive mice. Neutralizing antibodies were capable of reducing the paralysis in the mice, and immunosuppressants such as dexamethasone worsened the motor impairment and increased mortality [

 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In addition, EV-D68 exhibited strong tropism to the muscles, spinal cord, and lung in a neonatal mouse model and produced limb paralysis, tachypnea, and even death [

These in vivo experiments in mice verified the ability of EV-D68 to induce disorders in the nervous system and offered experimental evidence to support research into the relationship between EV-D68 and AFM. Furthermore, our research team found that neuron-expressed ICAM-5/telencephalin is a cellular receptor that is needed for EV-D68 to infect and enter host cells [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have noted that EV-D68 can also infiltrate the central nervous system through functional receptors located at the end of the olfactory nerve in the upper nasal cavity epithelium. The ability of EV-D68 to infect the host through neuron-specific molecules may indicate a potential link to neurological diseases and provide clues concerning the possibility of EV-D68 infection-associated AFM.
