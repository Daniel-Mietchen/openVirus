<p>Apart from the virus itself, community immunity, and especially the pre-existing virus serum neutralizing antibody (NAbs) in the community, are very likely to influence the spread and prevalence of the virus. Research on viral NAbs of specific populations can trace the history of viral infection and predict the susceptibility of a population to certain viruses. Xiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] collected serum samples from individuals with EV-D68 infection in Beijing, China from 2004 to 2011, tested the seroprevalence of EV-D68 NAbs, and found that the level of EV-D68 NAbs in the Chinese community in 2004 was remarkably lower in all age groups than in 2009. Furthermore, from 2007 to 2011, the NAbs against EV-D68 in the population increased over time. Meanwhile, researchers also found that the NAbs actually can inhibit virus replication. Thus, the high level of EV-D68 NAbs in the Chinese community could be one of the reasons why EV-D68 infection in China appears only sporadically instead of in the form of outbreaks.
