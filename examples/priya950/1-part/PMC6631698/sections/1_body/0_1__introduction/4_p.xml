<p>Recent studies on EV-D68 have mainly focused on epidemiology; the lack of basic research on its virologic characteristics and pathogenesis have hindered our further understanding of this virus. In this review, we will discuss advances regarding EV-D68â€™s genetic characteristics, infection mechanisms, interaction with hosts, and relationships with neurological diseases in order to provide useful information for future research into the pathogenesis and antiviral therapeutics of EV-D68.</p>
