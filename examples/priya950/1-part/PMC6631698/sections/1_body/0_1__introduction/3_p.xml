<p>The genome of EV-D68 contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA of about 7.6 kb. Like other picornaviruses, EV-D68 consists of a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by untranslated regions (UTR) at each end [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], encoding a precursor polyprotein that is further cleaved autocatalytically to yield four structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) and seven non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D) (

Viral protein 2C has been reported to play an important role in the processes of infection and viral-host interaction, making it a promising target for anti-EV-D68 drugs. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (Prozac) inhibits human enterovirus by targeting protein 2C and interfering with viral RNA replication [
