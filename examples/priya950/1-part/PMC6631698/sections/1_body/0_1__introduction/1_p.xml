<p>The genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> comprises many essential pathogens associated with human and mammalian diseases. This genus is classified into four groups: polioviruses, Coxsackie A viruses (CA), Coxsackie B viruses (CB), and echovirus. It contains fifteen species, encompassing four human enteroviruses (A-D), eight animal 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> species (E-L), and three rhinoviruses (A-C). Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a member of the 
 <italic>Enterovirus D</italic> group of the 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family. It was initially isolated and characterized from the throat swab samples taken from four Californian children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in 1962 [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00490" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], giving rise to four distinct virus strains: Fermon, Franklin, Robison, and Rhyne. In recent years, there has been a gradual emergence of new representative strains, such as US/MO/14-18947(MO), US/KY/14-18953(KY), and others.
