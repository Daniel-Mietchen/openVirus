<p>In urban and suburban settings, ZIKV dissemination involves human – mosquito – human cycle, with

 <italic>Aedes</italic> species are primarily daytime biting mosquitoes. The viral dissemination occurs through the blood-sucking mosquitoes which have a predilection for salivary glands. The virus multiplies in the salivary glands and persists there all its life. Few other mammals, such as elephants, zebras, and rats, may also serve as the likely ZIKV pool.[
