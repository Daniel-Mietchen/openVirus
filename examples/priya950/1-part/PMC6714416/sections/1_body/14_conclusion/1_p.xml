<p>ZIKV was a neglected tropical disease over the last 50 years (since its isolation in 1947). The disease is mainly transmitted through mosquito vector, although, various nonmosquito modes of spread are also known, with the virus being detected in body fluids (semen, saliva, urine, and breast milk). Therefore, preventive measures including vector control, prevention of insect bite, abstinence and use of condoms, avoiding travel to ZIKV endemic regions play an important role. Adopting universal infection control methods may significantly prevent dissemination in oral health-care settings. Recent advancements are being carried out in the form of effective ZIKV vaccine and anti-ZIKV drugs. However, Rapid geographic dissemination, nonspecific clinical presentation, lack of vaccine, and specific diagnostic test are the possible challenges to combat this dreaded public health menace.</p>
