<p>IAV and IBV have eight negative-sense RNA segments, each encoding one or two viral proteins. IAV encodes 10–11 proteins: HA, NA, NP, M1, M2, PA, PB1, PB2, NS1, NS2, and PB1-F2 [

ICV and IDV consist of only seven gene segments each, and they do not encode envelope glycoproteins HA and NA. Instead, they carry only one glycoprotein, HEF (haemagglutinin–esterase fusion), which combines the functions of HA and NA [
