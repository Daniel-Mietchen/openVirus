<p>During the late stages of the IAV replication cycle, the vRNP complexes as well as viral envelope glycoproteins and structural proteins need to be targeted to the virus assembly sites. M2 has to be transported from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) to the apical plasma membrane through the host secretory pathway [

 <xref rid="B169-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. This transport travelling is thought to be modulated by several cellular factors, including the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 4 (UBR4), the vesicle transport protein Rab11 and the transport protein particle complex 6A delta (TRAPPC6AÎ”).
