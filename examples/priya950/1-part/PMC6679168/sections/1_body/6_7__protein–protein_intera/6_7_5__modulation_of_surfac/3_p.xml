<p>The Rab11 pathway is known to be involved in the IAV budding process [
 <xref rid="B172-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Rab11 is a small GTP-binding protein that traffics proteins and vesicles between the trans-Golgi network (TGN), recycling endosome and apical membrane [

 <xref rid="B175-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. Knockout of Rab11 has also led to a reduction of M2 surface levels [
