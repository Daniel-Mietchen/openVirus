<p>Tetherin (BST-2, bone stromal cell antigen 2) is an interferon-inducible antiviral host factor that restricts the release of many enveloped viruses by forming a proteinaceous link, tethering budding virions to the cell surface [

IAV has evolved several mechanisms to neutralize the activity of tetherin, one of which involves AM2 interaction with tetherin to downregulate its surface expression via the proteasomal pathway, probably mediated by AM2 extracellular and transmembrane domains [
