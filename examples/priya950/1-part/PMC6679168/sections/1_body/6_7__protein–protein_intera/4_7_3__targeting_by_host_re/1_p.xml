<p>One identified binder of the cytoplasmic tail of M2 is annexin A6 (AnxA6) [

 <sup>2+</sup>/lipid-binding scaffold protein that interacts with lipid rafts and regulates cholesterol homeostasis. siRNA-silencing of AnxA6 expression has enhanced viral release, while its overexpression has resulted in reduced viral titer, suggesting that AnxA6 negatively regulates IAV infection [
