<p>The channel activity of IAV M2 has been found to be sufficient for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in influenza-infected cells [
 <xref rid="B142-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. AM2 also contributes to influenza pathogenesis by downregulating the expression and function of two host ion channels, the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) [
 <xref rid="B143-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>] and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channels [
 <xref rid="B144-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. These are present in apical membranes of lung epithelium and are important regulators for the absorption and secretion of fluids and electrolytes [

 <xref rid="B147-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]). AM2 has been found to reduce the surface protein levels and channel activity of ENaC, probably via signal transduction mechanisms. M2 can upregulate the steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species, likely by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), leading to modification of ENaC to enhance its endocytosis and proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of ENaC appears to be mediated by the C-terminus of M2 [
