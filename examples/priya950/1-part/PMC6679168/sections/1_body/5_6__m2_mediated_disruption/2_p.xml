<p>CFTR is a cyclic AMP-activated chloride channel that mediates the regulation of the thickness and composition of lung epithelial lining fluids (ELFs). M2 reduces the activity of the CFTR channel by alkalinizing the secretory organelle pH, thereby targeting CFTR for destruction via a ubiquitin-dependent pathway. Several studies have demonstrated that the proton channel activity of M2 is required for inhibition of CFTR: (i) addition of M2 ion channel inhibitor amantadine rescued CFTR expression and activity in 
 <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing both M2 and CFTR channels, and (ii) co-expression of CFTR with M2 channel-defective mutants (M2-G34V and M2-V27F) did not alter the GlyH-101-sensitive currents [
