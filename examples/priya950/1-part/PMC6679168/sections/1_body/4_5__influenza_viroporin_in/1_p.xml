<p>The vast majority of viroporin inhibitors have been developed against the AM2 protein. This is not surprising since AM2 was the first viroporin discovered, has a well-established biological role in viral pathogenesis and is a proven drug target [

 <xref rid="B121-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Amantadine (Amt, Symmetrel) is considered the first viroporin channel inhibitor and the second antiviral agent ever discovered [
 <xref rid="B122-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. It binds the pore of the AM2 channel in a hydrophilic pocket [

 <xref rid="B124-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Together with its close derivative, rimantadine (Rim, Flumadine), they are the only licensed antiviral drugs that target viroporins [
 <xref rid="B125-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] despite their modest affinity for AM2 (e.g., for Amt, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16 Î¼M). However, most currently circulating IAV strains are Amt- and Rim-resistant [

 <xref rid="B129-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], and therefore the use of Amt and Rim has been discontinued in humans [
 <xref rid="B130-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. The focus of the current research is the Amt-resistant variants of AM2 [

 <xref rid="B138-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Recently, the role of water in drug binding was highlighted by the demonstration that small molecules can enable potent inhibition by targeting key waters in hydrogen-bonded networks that are used to facilitate proton diffusion [
