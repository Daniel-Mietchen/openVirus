<p>NB protein is encoded by IBV at RNA segment 6 [
 <xref rid="B116-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. NB is modified by glycosylation and palmitoylation, with the latter being important for NB trafficking to the cell surface [
 <xref rid="B117-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Purified NB has been found to form ion channels when incorporated into artificial lipid bilayers [
 <xref rid="B118-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>], and further studies on an NB-S20A mutant have resulted in altered proton permeability and channel gating [
 <xref rid="B119-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. However, in contrast to the BM2 protein, NB is not required for viral replication in cell culture [
 <xref rid="B120-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. IBV NB cannot modify pH within the TGN [
 <xref rid="B107-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>].
