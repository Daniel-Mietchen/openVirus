<p>IAV and IBV encode other viroporins, PB1-F2 and NB, respectively. For the sake of completion, these two viroporins are briefly described here. PB1-F2 forms nonselective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers and microsomes [
 <xref rid="B111-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>], and is known to localize to the mitochondria of infected cells [
 <xref rid="B112-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. PB1-F2 can interact with two mitochondrial proteins—adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT3) and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1)—present in the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, respectively, leading to the dissipation of mitochondria membrane potential [

 <xref rid="B114-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. PB1-F2 from pathogenic IAV can be incorporated into the phagolysosomal compartment to trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation, inducing the secretion of pyrogenic cytokine IL-1β and thereby leading to severe pathophysiology [
 <xref rid="B115-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. In addition, the PB1-F2 of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) (PR8) has been reported to bind the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), leading to impairment of IFN-β production [
 <xref rid="B114-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. However, the precise role of PB1-F2 in modulation of IAV-induced immunopathogenesis remains to be dissected.
