<p>In BM2, although conductance at a low pH increases more than for AM2, proton conductance is still much lower than the theoretical conductance at a low pH. This suggests that conformational change of BM2 may also constitute a rate-limiting step [
 <xref rid="B43-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The role of the two His residues, especially His19, is important since an H19C mutation abolishes proton conduction [
 <xref rid="B88-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], whereas an H27A mutation can reduce proton transport by ∼25% in a liposome proton flux assay [
 <xref rid="B42-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The proton-dissociation equilibrium constants (pKa values) of the His19 tetrad in BM2 TM domain in lipid bilayers were found to be one pH unit lower (i.e., more difficult to protonate) than the pKa values of the AM2-equivalent His37 tetrad [

 <xref rid="B90-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. This was attributed to the presence of a second titratable histidine, His27 (in the position occupied by Arg45 in AM2), separated by three residues from Trp23 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00654-f001">Figure 1</xref>), forming a putative reverse WxxxH motif. This His27 residue was suggested to increase the proton-dissociation rate of His19 by stabilization of its neutral state. This has been confirmed by a two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) electrophysiological assay in 
 <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes [
 <xref rid="B43-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] that compared AM2 (A/Udorn/72) and BM2 (B/Lee/40) (both C-terminally fused to FLAG), where the apparent pK
 <sub>3</sub> (3rd protonation state) value of the AM2 channel was about one pH unit higher than that of the BM2 channel, indicating that the latter is less easily protonated and requires a lower pH for activation. Despite this, BM2 was found to have a 10-fold higher conductance than AM2, resulting in an overall 60% higher specific conductance of the BM2 channel than the AM2 channel at a pH of 5.5, which is consistent with liposome flux assays, where the specific conductance of BM2(1–33) is about double that of AM2(18–60) [
