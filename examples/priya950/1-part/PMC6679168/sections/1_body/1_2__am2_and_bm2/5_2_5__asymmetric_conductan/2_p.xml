<p>Interestingly, the BM2 proton channel is slightly outwardly rectified [

 <sub>in</sub> low/pH
 <sub>out</sub> high condition, the double mutant G26D/H27R (to mimic AM2 Asp44/Arg45) has achieved similar asymmetric proton flow (I–V curve inward rectified) to the AM2 channel [
 <xref rid="B43-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, asymmetric inward rectified proton flow can be restored by engineering these two residues of AM2 into the corresponding positions of the BM2 channel. Indeed, in the X-ray crystal structure of AM2(22–46), Asp44 participates in ionic interactions with Arg45 and also in water-mediated hydrogen bonding with Trp41 [

 <sub>out</sub> condition, similar to BM2 [
