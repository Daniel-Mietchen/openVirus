<p>A new type of influenza virus, known as type D, has recently been identified in cattle and pigs [
 <xref rid="B3-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The proteome of IDV is closer to ICV than to IAV or IBV [
 <xref rid="B2-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and, correspondingly, CM2 and DM2 share similarities. DM2 was recently tested in 
 <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) method, and an induced inward current was observed similar to that of CM2, with similar reversal potential [
 <xref rid="B110-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Neither CM2 nor DM2 contain an HxxxW motif (found in AM2 and BM2), but a “YxxxK” motif has been proposed instead [
 <xref rid="B110-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], where Y and K would have a lumenal orientation (parallel to H and W in the HxxxW motif found in AM2 and BM2) (see alignment). Indeed, the gating voltage of CM2 and DM2 was shown to be affected by modifications at the YxxxK motif [
 <xref rid="B110-cells-08-00654" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], which were proposed to be involved in cation–pi pairs between Y and K, and were proposed to be able to regulate ion flow. Overall, the significance of the difference in functional motifs between AM2 and BM2 versus CM2 and DM2 remains to be elucidated. The main features of viroporins in influenza are summarized in
