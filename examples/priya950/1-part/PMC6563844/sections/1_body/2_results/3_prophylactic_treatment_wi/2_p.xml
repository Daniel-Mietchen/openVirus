To evaluate potential additive effects of the two drugs and oseltamivir, mice were again treated orally once daily with the respective drug combinations, starting again 1 day before infection. In this series of experiments, the inhibitory effect of ketotifen alone was even less pronounced, and there was no additive effect when ketotifen and dextromethorphan were combined. Combination of each of the drugs with oseltamivir resulted in a slight, but non-significant increase in inhibition, but when all three drugs were combined, the inhibitory effect was significantly higher than that of oseltamivir alone (
