<p>Whole genome siRNA screens using different influenza A virus strains and cell lines have yielded a list of cellular proteins that are required in the influenza virus life cycle (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). While it is in most cases unknown if these identified proteins are directly interacting with viral proteins, or if they act indirectly, drugs that modulate their expression levels or activity may also inhibit influenza virus. Therefore, we computationally searched for FDA-approved drugs annotated in DrugBank (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) to target any of the genes in our updated host factor network generated by a meta-analysis of available influenza virus siRNA screen data sets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This bioinformatics analysis yielded 23 candidates, of which 15 drugs linked to 14 different host genes were chosen for further characterization based on oral bioavailability, since this would be a prerequisite for widespread use during a severe epidemic or pandemic. In addition, price, low organism toxicity, commercial availability, and level of connectivity of the respective target genes in our network were also taken into consideration (
