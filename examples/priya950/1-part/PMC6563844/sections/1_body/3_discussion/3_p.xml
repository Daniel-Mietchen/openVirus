<p>Two of the identified drugs, ketotifen, and dextromethorphan, not only led to a reduction of viral titers 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, but also in mice. While ketotifen blocks histamine H1 receptors and the release of inflammatory mediators, and is used to treat asthma, rhinitis, skin allergies, and anaphylaxis (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), dextromethorphan is primarily a σ
 <sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist and used as an alternative to opioid-containing cough suppressants (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The antiviral properties of ketotifen may thus be associated with its anti-inflammatory effect (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), which could be substantiated by comparatively quantifying the release of inflammatory mediators in ketotifen- and untreated infected cells or animals. In contrast, the mechanism of action is less obvious for dextromethorphan. Its target, the σ
 <sub>1</sub>-receptor, is a chaperone located at the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The protein plays an important role in cell homeostasis, since its knock down leads to ER stress, induction of the unfolded-protein response (UPR), dysfunctional autophagosomes, and oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>–
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), and it also modulates Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> release through the interaction with inositol 1,4,5-phosphate receptors (IP3R) (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). This modulation may underlie the anti-influenza effect of dextromethorphan, since viral transcription and replication require Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> action through calmodulin (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> is also involved in viral entry through the regulation of clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent endocytosis (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). If the primary mode of action of dextromethorphan-mediated σ
 <sub>1</sub>-receptor signaling inhibition lies in such a direct inhibition of viral entry or replication, or rather in the modulation of innate immune responses (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) is the subject of ongoing studies.
