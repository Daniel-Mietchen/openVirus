<p>For the calculation of the 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>), a modified plaque reduction assay was used (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded in 6-well plates and pretreated for 8 h with the drug of interest at 5-fold decreasing doses. The cells were then infected with the respective virus at a dose that yields 15–45 plaques per well in the absence of treatment. After incubation for 1 h at 37°C, the cells were washed with PBS, and overlayed with avicel (Sigma) containing the respective drug concentration. After 3 days, the overlay was removed and the wells were stained with 1% crystal violet solution (Sigma), and plaques were counted. GraphPad 6 was used for curve fitting and EC
 <sub>50</sub> calculation.
