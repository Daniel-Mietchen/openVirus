<p>The MTT assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher Vybrant MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit). Briefly, MDCK cells grown in a 96-well-plate were treated with the respective drugs at 5-fold descending concentrations starting at 500 mM or left untreated. After 24 h, medium was replaced by PBS containing 1 mM MTT. After incubation for 4 h at 37°C, supernatants were removed, mixed with DMSO and further incubated for 10 min at 37°C before absorption was measured at 562 nm using a PHOmo Microplate reader. To calculate the relative cytotoxicity, the absorbance of untreated cells was set to 1. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated using GraphPad 6, and the selectivity index (SI) represents the ratio of CC
 <sub>50</sub> to EC
 <sub>50</sub>.
