   <p>Phylogenetic analysis of Kilifi sequences and sequences retrieved from GenBank constructed using only full F gene sequences (1593 bp) to further asses the clustering of HMPV subgroups. A total 185 full F sequences were used. Sequences were subtyped using references sequences retrieved from GenBank. Reference sequences colored in red. The numbers next to branches indicate the bootstrap values, a branch with &gt; 70% bootstrap value was considered as a major branch. (PDF 44 kb)</p>
