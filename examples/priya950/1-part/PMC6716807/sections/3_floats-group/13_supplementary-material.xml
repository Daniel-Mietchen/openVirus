   <p>Changes in G gene nucleotide sequences for sequences collected from Kilifi. Sequences were aligned by subgroup and by epidemic year for subgroups B1 and B2. Nucleotide differences were determined and indicated by vertical colored bars. Orange red represent Adenine (A), Crimson represent Thymine (T), Indigo represents Guanine (G) and slate blue represent Cytosine (C) nucleotide. (PDF 167 kb)</p>
