<p id="Par21">Substitution rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) were determined under uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based approach implemented in BEAST v1.8.4. Demographic histories of HMPV subgroups were inferred using GMRF Bayesian Skyride model. BEAST analysis was set at 50 million states with sampling every 2500 steps. Selection pressure within F and G genes was analysed by estimating the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS = ω), using the codon-based phylogenetic method (CODEML) in PAML v 4.8a. Different site models were employed i.e. M0 (one ratio), M1a (Nearly Neutral), M2a (Positive Selection) and M3 (discrete) model. M0 model calculates a rough average value (ω) distributed across all sites (homogeneous ratios). M1a assumes two categories of sites: conserved sites with ω = 0 and neutral sites with ω = 1. M2a allows for three classes i.e. neutral ω = 1, purifying (0 ≤, ω &lt; 1), and positive selection ω &gt; 1. M3 estimates ω ratios as M2a but using an unconstrained discrete distribution [

Only sites with posterior probabilities &gt; 95% were considered as positively selected based on Bayes Empirical Bayes method.
