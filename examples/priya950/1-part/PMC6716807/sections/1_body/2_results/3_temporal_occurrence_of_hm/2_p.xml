<p id="Par27">HMPV subgroup prevalence and dominance in Kilifi was compared to other countries around the world. This was based on analysis of 714 F gene sequences from 18 different countries and 500 G gene sequences from 15 countries retrieved from GenBank (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). General agreement in subgroup prevalence patterns was observed for Kilifi and global data sets, the predominance of A2b and B2 in 2007–2010 and subsequent rise of B1 and A2c in years that followed, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Notably, at finer levels there were differences in subgroup temporal occurrence. Globally, clades A2b, A2c and subgroup B1 persisted over the 9 years. In contrast, in Kilifi only subgroup B2 persisted over the 9 years. The dominance of B1 strains in 2011 was also evident globally. A1 and A2a were the least commonly detected subgroups globally and not observed in Kilifi.
