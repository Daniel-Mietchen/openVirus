<p id="Par26">During the 10-year period of surveillance described here, HMPV infections occurred in a seasonal pattern, mainly between the month of October of one year and April of the following year, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, which was used to define an epidemic year, i.e. starting September of one year through August of the following year. Thus, subsequent analyses were done by epidemic year. Multiple subgroups co-circulated within a single epidemic year from 2007 to 2016, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b. There was a shift in dominance from A2b (2007 to 2011) to B1 (2012 to 2014) with subsequent rise of the A2c in recent years. Notably, B2 subgroups remained persistent but non-dominant. A2b viruses circulated only until November 2012.
