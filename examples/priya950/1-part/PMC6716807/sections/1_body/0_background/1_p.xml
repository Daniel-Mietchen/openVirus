<p id="Par13">Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with a genome of about 13 kb [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The virus belongs to the 
 <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> family and genus 
 <italic>Metapneumovirus</italic>. HMPV infections occur across all ages with severe disease predominantly occurring in children below 2 years of age and the elderly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since first description in 2001 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], HMPV has been detected in all continents and its disease prevalence varies widely [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nearly every child by the age of 5 years has been infected by HMPV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Clinical presentation of HMPV infection ranges from mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe lower respiratory tract disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and overlaps with that of other common respiratory viruses especially respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
