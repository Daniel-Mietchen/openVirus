<p id="Par14">HMPV is classified into two major groups, A and B, based on antigenic variation and nucleotide differences in the fusion (F), nucleoprotein (N) and attachment (G) glycoprotein genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses of F (open reading frame, i.e. ORF) and G (ORF) sequences further divides the two groups into subgroups i.e. A1 and A2 (group A), and B1 and B2 (group B) subgroups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, there has been report of within subgroup A2 division, i.e. presence of two phylogenetically distinct clades A2a and A2b [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A few studies have revealed increased heterogeneity of A2, including identification of another distinct clade, provisionally assigned as A2c [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, two novel clades within subgroup A2 with 180 or 111 nucleotide duplications in the G gene have been detected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Geographically, HMPV subgroups have been reported to circulate widely and cluster temporally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], with the exception of subgroup A1 that has been identified in a few countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. There is frequent co-circulation of subgroups with replacement of the predominant subgroup after a period of one or two seasons, although the drivers of this phenomena are unclear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Virus prevalence also varies from year-to-year within the same location [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].
