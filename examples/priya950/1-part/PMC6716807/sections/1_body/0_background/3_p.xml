<p id="Par15">A few studies have reported long-term subgroup circulation patterns of HMPV, necessary for improved epidemiological understanding and, in due course, of potential value to the design and implementation of control measures. In addition, there are a few studies on HMPV in Africa, which bears a high burden of pneumonia morbidity and mortality [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In this study, we analysed the surface F and G gene nucleotide sequences collected through paediatric pneumonia surveillance at the Kilifi County Hospital in rural coastal Kenya, from 2007 to 2016, to describe the molecular epidemiology and gain insights into the spread and the evolutionary dynamics of HMPV. The two genes (F and G) code for immunogenic surface proteins that are the targets for vaccine development. G gene is highly variable and is used to assess the diversity of HMPV. Similarly, F gene which is quite conserved, has been used to characterise HMPV and is the gene of target in many molecular diagnostic assays. This report extends our previously published work from the same location for the period 2007â€“11 [
