<p id="Par32">There remains limited information on long-term circulation patterns and prevalence of HMPV in Africa. This study reports HMPV subtype incidence and molecular evolution in coastal Kenya over a 10-year period of surveillance (2007 to 2016). HMPV incidence in children under 5 years of age varied annually ranging from 1.2 to 8.7% and 71.5% of HMPV infections were in children aged &lt; 2 years. Wide variation in annual prevalence has been reported elsewhere from long-term studies of acute respiratory infection (ARI) aetiology in children: in Germany, HMPV prevalence over 10 years of surveillance varied between 1.4 and 32.8% [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In this study, no significant association was found between subgroup and disease severity or clinical presentation. Further studies are necessary to evaluate whether changes in subgroup are associated with changes in disease severity and prevalence. Climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall and relative humidity have also been shown to influence HMPV activity in the tropics [
