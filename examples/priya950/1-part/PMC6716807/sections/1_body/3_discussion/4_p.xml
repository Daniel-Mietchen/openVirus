<p id="Par35">As is the norm for HMPV detection in respiratory samples, we used molecular PCR-based diagnostics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that mutations at primer and probe binding sites can lead to false negative diagnostic results and hence underestimation of disease burden [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Evaluation of the in-house diagnostic rRT-PCR assay would be important to determine whether there are any missed variants/subgroups and whether this can be associated with the apparent gradual decline in HMPV prevalence observed in the current dataset. There is also some evidence that reduction in bacterial pneumonia (e.g. 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>), as has been seen in this coastal location over this study period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], results in a reduction in viral pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Future investigations will be necessary to give more insight.
