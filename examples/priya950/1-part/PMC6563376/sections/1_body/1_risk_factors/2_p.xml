<p id="Par6">Many studies evaluated risk factors for severe influenza during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Adult ICU patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection were primarily non-elderly, were obese [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and had higher odds of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multi-lobar pneumonia when compared with seasonal influenza patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In children, independent risk factors for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-related mortality included chronic neurologic condition or immune compromise, acute myocarditis or encephalitis, and early presumed MRSA co-infection of the lung [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Female gender was also identified as a risk factor; however, there was no gender difference in overall mortality. Bacterial co-infection was identified in approximately one third of fatal influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases in the largest autopsy case series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Bacterial co-infections in the inter-pandemic period are also common in critically ill influenza patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. One study identified past or current tobacco use as a risk factor associated with ICU admission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A recent multicenter cohort study reported that mortality was higher in immunosuppressed patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 than in immunocompetent patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Severity of influenza seasons varies from year-to-year based on the predominant influenza viruses, and between seasonal and pandemic influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. One study reported that patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 had higher odds of severe disease than patients with either influenza A(H3N2) or influenza B virus infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, influenza B virus infection has been shown to increase the odds of in-hospital mortality in children compared with influenza A virus infection [
