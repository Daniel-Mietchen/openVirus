<p id="Par8">Despite the benefits of influenza vaccination, there continues to be low vaccine coverage among adults admitted to the ICU who often have a high prevalence of high-risk comorbidities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In children, low influenza vaccination coverage has also been reported among those admitted to pediatric ICUs, even among those with underlying high-risk conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Full influenza vaccination was shown to result in a 74% reduction in pediatric ICU admissions compared to unvaccinated or partially vaccinated influenza patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Furthermore, one study showed that influenza VE was 65% in reducing the risk of mortality in children aged 6 months to 17 years in the U.S. [
