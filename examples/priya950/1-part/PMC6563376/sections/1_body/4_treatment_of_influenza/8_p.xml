<p id="Par22">Multiple studies have reported that corticosteroid treatment is associated with prolonged influenza viral shedding in hospitalized patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>], including in sporadic human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>], and increased rates of secondary bacterial and fungal co-infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>], which may lead to adverse clinical outcomes. However, there is some evidence to suggest that the increased risk attributed to corticosteroid treatment is a result of bias in observational studies. A large, retrospective study of critically ill adults in Canada found an increased risk of mortality in patients receiving corticosteroids; however, after adjusting for time-dependent differences between groups, no significant differences in mortality were observed with corticosteroid treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. Moreover, potential differences between low-dose and medium-/high-dose corticosteroid treatment are not well understood. One observational study of hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia due to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in China reported that high-dose, but not low or moderate-dose corticosteroids, was associated with increased 30-day and 60-day mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. Currently, on the basis of available observational data to date, adjunctive corticosteroid treatment is not recommended for children or adults hospitalized with influenza, including critically ill patients, unless clinically indicated for another reason, such as treatment of asthma or COPD exacerbation or septic shock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Further studies are required to understand the clinical benefit or harms associated with corticosteroid treatment of critically ill influenza patients.
