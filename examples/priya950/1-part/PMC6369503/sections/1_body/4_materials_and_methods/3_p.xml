 <italic>Molecular detection of densovirus</italic> - Briefly, viral nucleic acids from C6/36 cell supernatants infected with each ZIKV strain were isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). For MDV DNA amplification (324 bp), the primers DNV3R (5’-TTTATTTCCATAGATATTGACTGTTTCGAT-3’) and DNV3F 5’-AATCGAGAAACAGCATACTACACATTCGT-3’) were used as previously described.

 </xref> These primers amplified a viral genomic region encompassing a small segment of the NS1 and NS2 genes of MDV. As a control for MDV amplification, a plasmid containing the same target gene from the MDV BR/07 isolate was used.
