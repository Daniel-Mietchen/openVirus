 <italic>Immunofluorescence assay for ZIKV and MDV detection</italic> - C6/36 cells (2x10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate and infected (in triplicate) with P.0 of ZIKV 
 <italic>strain A</italic> and 
 <italic>strain B</italic> at an MOI of 1. The MOI was based on the titration of ZIKV 
 <italic>strain A</italic> and 
 <italic>strain B</italic> in C6/36 using a pan-flavivirus monoclonal antibody that recognises the E protein (4G2; ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> HB-112™; see ZIKV titration using foci forming assay). After 72 h, the cells were fixed and permeabilised with methanol:acetone (v/v) as previously described.

 </xref> For immunostaining, three different antibodies were used - an anti-flavivirus envelope (E) protein (4G2), an 
 <italic>in-house</italic> mouse polyclonal antibody anti-MDV and an anti-MDV monoclonal antibody (clone 94DL1; IgG2a kappa).

 </xref> A goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate was used as secondary antibody, and digital images were taken with a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI6000B) using LAS AF (Leica) software. As an MDV positive control, C6/36 cells were infected with MDV BR/07 (GenBank: GU452720) with a multiplicity of genome (MOG) of 0.01 or 1 for 72 h. The polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against MDV strain BR/07 used in the immunostaining assays were generated in a previous study.
