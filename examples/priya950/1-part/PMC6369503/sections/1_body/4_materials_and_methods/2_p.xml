 <italic>ZIKV titration using foci forming assay</italic> - ZIKV virus titers were determined by the foci forming immunodetection assay in C6/36 cells (FFU
 <sub>C6/36</sub>/mL), as previously described.

 </xref> Briefly, C6/36 cells were infected with 10-fold serially diluted mice sera / cell culture supernatant for 90 minutes. After inoculum was removed a CMC overlay media (L-15 plus 5% SFB, 0.26% tryptose, 25 µg/mL gentamicin, 1.6% carboxymethylcellulose) was added and plates incubated at 28ºC for seven days. The immunostaining was performed using the anti-flavivirus mouse monoclonal antibody 4G2 (anti-E protein; ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> HB-112™), followed by alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The reaction was detected using NBT/BCIP substrate solution (nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-39-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt) (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Foci were counted and expressed as FFU
 <sub>C6/36</sub>/mL.
