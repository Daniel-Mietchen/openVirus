 <italic>MDV removal from ZIKV samples</italic> - As MDV does not infect vertebrate cells, we performed serial passages of ZIKV 
 <italic>strain A</italic> P.0 and 
 <italic>strain B</italic> P.0 in A549 cells (lung epithelial cells; ATCC: CCL185). Briefly, A549 cells (1x10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 24 well plates) were infected with 100 µL of ZIKV 
 <italic>strain A</italic> P.0 or 
 <italic>strain B</italic> P.0 for 90 min. After infection, cell monolayers were washed three times with 1X PBS and incubated in culture medium (DMEM-F12, 7% FCS, 100 IU/µg/mL of penicillin/streptomycin) for 72 h. The cell culture supernatants were collected and used (100 µL) to infect a new set of A549 cell cultures (second passage). An additional passage in A549 cells was performed as previously described (third passage). To confirm the exclusion of MDV after three passages in A549 cells, the cell culture supernatant of ZIKV 
 <italic>strain A</italic> P.3/A549 and 
 <italic>strain B</italic> P.3/A549 was passaged three additional times in the C6/36 mosquito cell line. All A549 and C6/36 cell passages were performed as described above. Nucleic acid was extracted from cell supernatants, and RT-PCR and PCR were performed for ZIKV and MDV, respectively.
