 <italic>Densovirus nucleic acid sequencing</italic> - PCR fragments (324 bp) from MDV detection were purified using the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche), and nucleotide sequencing was performed with primers for DNV3R and DNV3F by dideoxynucleotide termination sequencing at Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea). The sequences were assembled using the Assembler tool (http://www.hpabioinformatics.org.uk/cgibin/assembly_tool/seq_assemble.cgi?no=2) and aligned using ClustalW
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> as implemented in BioEdit software v.7.2.5.
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>18</sup>
 </xref> The length of nucleotide sequence used in the analysis was 265 bp due to the primer sequence removal. The consensus sequence of densovirus 
 <italic>strain A</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic> were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers, MH720336 and MH720337, respectively.
