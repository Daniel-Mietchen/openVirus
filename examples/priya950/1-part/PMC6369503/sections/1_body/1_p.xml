However, recent outbreaks and clinical manifestations associated with ZIKV infection resulted in more than 4,500 Zika-related published medical/scientific manuscripts during the 2016/2018 period. This increase in research was beneficial to the ZIKV field and added to our understanding of this new, emerging viral disease.
