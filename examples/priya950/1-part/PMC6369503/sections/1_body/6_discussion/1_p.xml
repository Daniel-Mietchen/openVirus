<p>The exchange of biological samples, such as viral isolates and cell lines, often occurs between research laboratories. Although this is important for scientific development, the certification of the microorganism strains or cell lines shared between laboratories is essential to avoid contamination problems. One of the most notorious cases of biological contamination in research laboratories is the contamination of cell lines with HeLa cells.

 </xref> Contamination of cell lines with MDV is not unusual, as this has already been demonstrated in the mosquito cell lines C6/36 and AP-61.

 </xref> Although difficult to track, we suspect that the MDV contamination origin began in contaminated cell cultures used for virus propagation prior to both ZIKV strains being exhaustively shared between laboratories.
