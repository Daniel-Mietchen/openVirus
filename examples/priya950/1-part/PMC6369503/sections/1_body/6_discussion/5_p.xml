<p>Since coinfections are not limited to ZIKV strains, researchers who work in the arbovirology field should check their cell lines and viral stocks periodically to avoid contamination with arthropod viruses such as MDV. The main purpose of reporting these findings is to call the attention of the scientific community of the potential presence of mosquito virus contaminants in ZIKV strains/stocks. We also suggest two simple strategies to efficiently eliminate MDV contamination from ZIKV strains/stocks, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> passages in vertebrate cell lines or mice models, respectively. Finally, the potential interference of MDV contamination in ZIKV isolates needs further analysis.
