<p>There are no studies addressing the effects of coinfections with MDV and ZIKV, and the outcome of such a coinfection is unknown; however, the negative impact of MDV in dengue virus infection and replication was demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, further reinforcing the potential use of MDV for the biological control of arboviral infections.

 </xref> Given the similarities between DENV and ZIKV, it is plausible that MDV and ZIKV coinfection may affect 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> ZIKV infections. Conversely, studies using the C6/36 cell line and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito models have shown that coinfections with the chikungunya and densonucleosis viruses do not impact the infection and replication of either virus.

 </xref> Furthermore, MDV could induce the production of antibodies in BALB/C mice after immunisation with Freundâ€™s complete adjuvant (first dose) and Alu-S-Gel (doses 2 to 4).

 </xref> Thus, the potential impact of infecting mice with flaviviruses (dengue or ZIKV) contaminated with MDV is still an open question.
