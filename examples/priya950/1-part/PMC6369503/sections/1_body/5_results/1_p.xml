<p>Two different ZIKV strains (referred to as 
 <italic>strain A</italic> and 
 <italic>strain B</italic>) were recently sent to our laboratory from two different sources for research purposes. During the preparation of viral stocks, visual inspection of C6/36 cell cultures revealed an atypical cytopathic phenotype that raised suspicion of potential contamination with an additional virus/microorganism (
