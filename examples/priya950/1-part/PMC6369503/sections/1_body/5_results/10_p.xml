<p>As an alternative protocol, we also hypothesised that passing ZIKV isolates in susceptible mice would eliminate MDV. To test this hypothesis, type I IFN receptor KO (A129) mice were infected with contaminated stocks of ZIKV 
 <italic>strain A</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>A)
 <italic>.</italic> Blood was collected from one to four dpi and tested for MDV. As early as 1 dpi and throughout the kinetics, blood samples were negative for MDV. We also allowed 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to feed on the blood of infected mice at 3 dpi to further test for the successful elimination of MDV (since it would be amplified in mosquitoes even if present at low titers). Mosquitoes that fed on infected mice were negative for MDV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>B). These results indicate that the passage of MDV-contaminated ZIKV-stocks in mice is also a suitable method to eliminate contamination. For all time points, the presence of MDV was tested in mice and mosquitoes, and we confirmed ZIKV RNA using RT-PCR (data not shown). Additionally, ZIKV was recovered from mice sera at higher titers three days after infection (

 <italic>strain A</italic> (
