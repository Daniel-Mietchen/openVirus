 </xref> Once we confirmed contamination of each ZIKV strain with MDV, we focused on strategies to eliminate it from the ZIKV samples to prevent interference with future experiments. It was previously demonstrated that MDV does not infect vertebrate cells,

  <sup>6</sup>

 <italic>strains A</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic> using a ZIKV-susceptible A549 lung epithelial cell line.

 </xref> After three passages of ZIKV 
 <italic>strains A</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic> in A549 cells, the MDV coinfection was no longer detected in cell culture supernatants using PCR, while detection of a ZIKV envelope gene was successful (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>A). Additionally, PCR for MDV and RT-PCR for ZIKV were performed after each passage (P1, P2 and P3) using nucleic acids extracted from the supernatants, and the results demonstrated that fragments of the NS1 and NS2 genes of MDV were not detected for 
 <italic>strain A</italic> after the first passage (P1) in A549 cells or at the second passage (P2) for 
 <italic>strain B</italic> (data not shown).
