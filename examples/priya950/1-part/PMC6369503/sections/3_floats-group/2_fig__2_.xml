  <title>mosquito densovirus (MDV) clearance from the Zika virus (ZIKV) strains A and B (P.0). Agarose gels showing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a 324 bp fragment from MDV and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of a 364 bp ZIKV E gene fragment in ZIKV strain A and strain B after three passages in A549 cells (P.3/A549) (A) followed by three passages in C6/36 cells (P.3/C6/36) (B). (C) Immunofluorescence assay in C6/36 cells infected with ZIKV strain A and strain B (P.3/C6/36) after three passages in C6/36 cells stained with 4G2 monoclonal antibody, anti-MDV mouse polyclonal serum, and anti-MDV monoclonal antibody (clone 94DL1). (D) Cytopathic effects on C6/36 cells infected with ZIKV strain A and strain B after three passages in C6/36 compared to mock-infected cells. Infection with the MDV BR/07 strain multiplicity of genome (MOG) 0.01 for 72 h was used as positive control for immunofluorescence and cytopathic effect assays. (E) Agarose gel showing PCR amplification of a 324 bp fragment from MDV. C6/36 cells were infected with different multiplicity of infections (MOIs) (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10) of ZIKV strain A and strain B after three passages in C6/36 cells (P.3 C6/36). Nucleic acid was extracted from cell pellet and cell culture supernatant of infected cells and tested for the amplification of MDV genes by PCR. As a positive control, a plasmid containing the same target gene from the isolate MDV BR/07 was used (324 bp).</title>
