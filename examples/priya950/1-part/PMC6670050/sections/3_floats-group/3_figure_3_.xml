 <caption>
  <p>Comparison of empirical and reconstructed prevalences of dengue immunoglobulin G from independent serosurveys carried out in Singapore in 2004, 2009, 2013, and 2017. Empirical estimates are shown as black dots and 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals by black bars. Solid gray lines represent the model estimates for 2004 (A), 2009 (B), 2013 (C), and 2017 (D), with the gray shaded regions representing 95% Bayesian credible intervals. Degradation of the sensitivity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay over time was taken into account in the reconstructed estimates.</p>
