  <p>Estimated age-specific dengue seroprevalence in Singapore in 2017, modeled from 4 hypothetical circumstances: force of infection (FOI) fixed at the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s averages, respectively. The black line represents the age-specific seroprevalence in 2017 based on the original FOI estimates. Of the 4 hypothetical situations, the largest number of dengue infections averted occurs when the FOI is held fixed at the 1960s average (3.12 million; 95% Bayesian credible interval (BCrI): 2.94, 3.27), assuming that numbers of primary and subsequent dengue infections are similar. For scenarios where FOI is held fixed at the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s averages, the numbers of dengue infections averted are estimated to be 1.90 million (95% BCrI: 1.63, 2.14), 0.87 million (95% BCrI: 0.61, 1.13), and −0.11 million (95% BCrI: −0.30, 0.07), respectively.</p>
