<p>Trends of primary dengue infections averted among residents in 2017 across age were projected from 4 hypothetical FOI situations (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwz110F6">6</xref>). Assuming the number of primary and subsequent infections to be equal throughout the period, using estimates from patients presenting at primary-care clinics (
 <xref rid="kwz110C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), estimates of the total number of infections averted would be 3.12, 1.90, 0.87, and −0.11 million for an FOI held fixed at the average of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, respectively. However, these 4 estimates are sensitive to the assumed ratio of primary infections to nonprimary infections and, in sensitivity analysis, vary over the range of 2.34, 1.43, 0.65, and −0.08 million to 4.68, 2.86, 1.30, and −0.17 million, if the ratio of primary cases to nonprimary cases is changed to 2:1 or 1:2. No additional infections were averted among residents on the basis of the FOI held fixed at the 2000s average, and a wide Bayesian credible interval was observed (–10,000 infections, 95% BCrI: −110,000, 100,000).
