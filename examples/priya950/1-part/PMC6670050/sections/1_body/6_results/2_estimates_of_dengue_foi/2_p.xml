<p>The observed and reconstructed age-stratified prevalence rates from the serosurveys are presented in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwz110F3">3</xref>. The goodness of fit of the age-stratified seroprevalence estimates was found to be reasonable for the 2004, 2013, and 2017 data (Table 
 <xref rid="kwz110TB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For the pediatric data from 2009, however, there was a notable discrepancy in the youngest age groups, which had empirical estimates for seroprevalence that were higher than the model predicted. Excluding children under 5 years of age from the 2009 cohort produced more adequate estimates, though there was a small cluster of outlying results in young adults. The extent to which these discrepancies reflect biases in recruitment or the impact of 2 large outbreaks (2005 and 2007) occurring prior to sampling in 2008â€“2010 is unclear.
