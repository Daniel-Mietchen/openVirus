<p>While the dengue incidence rate in Singapore has increased dramatically in the last 25 years, the trend contradicts the falling trend of FOI and seroprevalence. We suspect that this is largely due to the surfacing of a larger part of the dengue “iceberg” in the last 2 decades and to the availability of improved diagnostic procedures, increased awareness among the public, and increased use of laboratory diagnosis by the medical community. Besides the ongoing effort in promoting early laboratory testing and use of rapid diagnostic test kits in Singapore, the improved reporting rate could also be attributed to the shift of infections to adult age groups (discussed below), where primary dengue tends to be more apparent than it is in children (
