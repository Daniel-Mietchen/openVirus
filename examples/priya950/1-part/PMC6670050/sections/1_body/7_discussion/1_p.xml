<p>Regular seroprevalence studies in Singapore, coupled with mathematical models, have allowed estimation of FOI and the true number of dengue infections in this dengue-endemic city-state. The FOI reflects changes in the demographic characteristics of a population as well as the risk in transmission, and it can behave in nonintuitive ways; for instance, a falling FOI can coincide with a rise in the incidence of severe dengue (

Cross-sectional serological studies coupled with epidemiologic models provide new insights beyond what is available from case notification alone: Marked changes in the FOI for dengue have been noted in Thailand, for instance, using pediatric cross-sections, mirroring a shift in the age profile of cases there (
