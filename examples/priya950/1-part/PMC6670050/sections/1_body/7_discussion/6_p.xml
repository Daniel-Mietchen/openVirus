<p>However, the progressive lowering of herd immunity poses challenges. First, lower herd immunity makes vector control less effective, since each infected mosquito has a relatively greater chance of infecting 1 or more susceptible hosts. The need to further reduce the already-low vector population is expected to escalate costs considerably. A paradigm shift is needed to reduce contact between susceptible human hosts and infected vectors. Besides dengue vaccination (
