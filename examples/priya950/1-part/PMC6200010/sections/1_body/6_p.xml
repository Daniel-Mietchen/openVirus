<p>Our results indicate that French Polynesia was the main hub of dissemination of the ZIKV
 <sub>SP-AM</sub> lineage and seeded independent outbreaks in several South Pacific islands (including Easter Island) and the Americas from late 2013 to mid-2014, coinciding with a peak in the number of suspected Zika cases in French Polynesia. The long period of cryptic circulation of Zika virus in the Americas, the early detection of Zika virus in the Caribbean in December 2014 (

 </xref>) viruses from French Caribbean territories into French Polynesia during 2013â€“2014 support the hypothesis that Zika virus might have been introduced to and circulated in the Caribbean region for several months before its detection in Brazil in 2015. Human movement between overseas French territories might create an epidemiologic link for arboviral transmissions between the South Pacific and the Caribbean region.
