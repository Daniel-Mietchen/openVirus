<p>French Polynesia was the most probable source location of the Zika virus clade I strains introduced into the Americas (PSP 1), Vanuatu (PSP 1), and New Caledonia (PSP 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>0.98), as well as of the clade II strain introduced into Easter Island (PSP 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>0.77), refuting the hypothesis of introduction of Zika virus into the Americas through Easter Island. The source location of the clade II strain of the Cook Islands was traced to Easter Island (PSP &gt;0.34) or Easter Island (PSP 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>0.37). Our analyses indicate that Zika virus was introduced into Easter Island, New Caledonia, the Cook Islands, and the Americas at around the same time (BCI 2013.6–2014.8), supporting a much longer period of undetected Zika virus transmission in the Americas (≈15 months) (
