<p>From 5′-to-3′, the ORF comprises three regions: (i) P1, encoding the structural capsid viral proteins (VP4–VP2–VP3–VP1), while, in some picornaviruses, also codifying a short leader L-protein; (ii) P2, encoding the viral non-structural proteins 2A−2B−2C; and (iii) P3 encoding the viral non-structural proteins 3A−3B−3C−3D (Palmenberg,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In particular, 3D is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or 3Dpol) that synthesizes the virus genome and 3B (which is VPg) acts as its primer, being the only non-structural protein in the virion (Palmenberg,
