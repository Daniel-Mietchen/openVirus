<p>Picornaviruses' high mutation rates permit the rapid escape from the immune system. The change of residues in the exterior capsid surface overcomes the intense pressure exerted by host Abs. These properties were used to locate capsid antigenic sites by testing neutralizing Abs (nAbs) escape mutants 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Minor et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Sherry et al., 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Stapleton and Lemon, 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Successful progeny virus rely on capsid functionality. Therefore, the preservation of the architecture and receptor binding restrict viable mutations. The exposed jelly-roll loops can accommodate mutations easier than secondary structure elements and protein–protein interacting surfaces (Murray et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Usherwood and Nash, 
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Several structural studies by cryoEM revealed the way nAbs bind to solvent-exposed loops of VP1–3 by interacting with critical residues. Complexes of viruses with Fab-Abs fragments can display 1-Fab:1-protomer ratio following the icosahedral symmetry. Nevertheless, when epitopes are close to the symmetry axis, lower binding ratios are observed due to Fab–Fab steric hindrance (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Three mechanisms of neutralization are interpreted from these structures: (i) destabilization of the virion by triggering conformational changes upon Fab binding, which is accompanied by the “pocket factor” release when present (Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Plevka et al., 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Dong et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Zheng et al., 
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), (ii) stabilization of virions by cross-linking of protomers to prevent conformational changes for infection (Ye et al., 
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), (iii) virus aggregation by antibody cross-linking particles (Mosser et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>), and (iv) opsonization that can interfere with virus-cell attachment and receptor binding (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
