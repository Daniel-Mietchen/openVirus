<p>Hiding the receptor-interacting surface from Abs surveillance is the hypothetical function of the canyon (Rossmann, 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). Therefore, the canyon is the result of an evolutionary process to preserve and protect the critical residues required for host-cell receptor recognition. Conversely, accessible areas can mutate to disguise the virus from the humoral immune response. Nevertheless, some observations have challenged this view, proposing the receptor-binding site topology as an uncoating mechanism that dictates receptor binding to trigger the uncoating event (Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). These views are not strictly incompatible; hence, both pictures contribute to the paradigm of picornavirus capsid evolution. Here, capsid topology arose out of and continues to be shaped by the interplay of host environmental pressure, random genome mutations, and fixation of mutations when beneficial.
