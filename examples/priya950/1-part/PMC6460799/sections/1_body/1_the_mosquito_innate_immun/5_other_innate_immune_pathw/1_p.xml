<p id="Par44">In addition to the RNAi pathway, there are other innate immune pathways involved in protecting mosquitoes against viral infection, including the JAK-STAT, Toll and Imd pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In response to viral infection, activation of these pathways initiates the formation of a multiprotein complex consisting of protein kinases, transcription factors and other regulatory molecules to regulate the expression of downstream innate immunity genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. These include genes that encode for AMPs and key factors that regulate the innate immune response to viruses. AMPs are immune-inducible peptides that are potent and rapid-acting immune effectors with antimicrobial activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. A wide spectrum of AMPs have been reported in insects during infection with Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, filamentous fungi and yeast [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. These AMPs carry out both direct killing and innate immune modulation (recruitment and activation of immune cells) to limit invading pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Most studies on the regulation of AMPs during infection are based on 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and the regulation of AMPs in mosquitoes is poorly understood. AMPs vary among different mosquito species and the induction of AMPs is regulated by multiple immune signaling pathways and is highly dependent on the type of pathogen that elicited the response. In 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 17 AMPs have been identified, and they belong to five different families: defensins (cysteine-rich peptides), cecropins (α-helical peptides), diptericin (glycine-rich peptides), attacin (glycine-rich peptides) and gambicin (cysteine-rich peptides) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The mode of killing of AMPs is often specific for different microorganisms. Defensins are active and highly toxic against Gram-positive bacteria and parasites by disrupting the membrane permeability barrier, thereby causing loss of motility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. As for cecropins, these positively charged peptides bind to the lipids in the membrane that are negatively charged, thus changing the biological structure of membranes. Other possible modes of killing by cecropins include inhibition of nucleic acid and protein synthesis and inhibition of enzymatic activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Defensins and cecropins have been found to be expressed in the midgut, thorax and abdominal tissues of 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> mosquitoes and are induced during infection with parasite [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In the same mosquito species, gambicin has been found to be induced by parasites in the midgut, fat body and hemocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. However, their role in regulating antiviral immune response is not completely understood. In 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, cecropins are upregulated in DENV-2 infected mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Furthermore, cecropins exhibit antiviral activity against DENV and CHIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes, Vago is a secreted peptide regulated by the JAK-STAT pathway and overexpression of Vago reduces the viral load of WNV in mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. During SINV infection in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>, two AMPs, regulated by the Imd and the JAK-STAT pathways, namely the attacin C and diptericin B, control viral RNA synthesis and knocking down of these genes increases viral load in flies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
