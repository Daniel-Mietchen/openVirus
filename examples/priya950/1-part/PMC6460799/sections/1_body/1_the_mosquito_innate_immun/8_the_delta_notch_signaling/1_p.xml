<p id="Par51">The evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway, Delta-Notch, plays crucial roles in embryonic development, stem cell maintenance and adult tissue renewal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. While the Delta-Notch signaling pathway was well described for its role in developmental processes, a recent study has reported a new role of the Delta-Notch signaling pathway in antiviral innate immunity in the mosquito, by limiting the replication of DENV in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Notch is a transmembrane receptor and signaling depends on the binding of Delta ligands, which activates the proteolysis of the Notch receptor, releasing an active fragment, known as the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that enters the nucleus to activate downstream target genes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. During DENV infection, components of this pathway including 
 <italic>Delta</italic>, 
 <italic>Notch</italic> and 
 <italic>Hindsight</italic> genes were also shown to be upregulated in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism of how this signaling pathway limits DENV replication is not known, this study showed that activation of this signaling pathway induced endoreplication, in which cells undergo many rounds of DNA replication without mitosis to increase dramatically the genomic DNA content in the cells. Induction of endoreplication increased the number of gene transcripts that are involved in controlling viral spread [
