<p id="Par46">The Dome receptor is the most well characterized cytokine receptor in mosquitoes; however, evidence suggests that other cytokine receptors are present which also activate the JAK-STAT pathway. For example, in 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes, a secreted peptide known as Vago was upregulated in response to WNV infection, subsequently activating the JAK-STAT pathway to control infection and reduce viral load [

 <italic>Dome</italic> did not inhibit signaling of the JAK-STAT pathway, indicating that Vago activated JAK-STAT 
 <italic>via</italic> another unknown receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
