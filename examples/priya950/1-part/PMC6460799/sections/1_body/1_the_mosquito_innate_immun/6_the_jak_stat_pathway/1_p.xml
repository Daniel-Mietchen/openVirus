<p id="Par45">The JAK-STAT pathway was originally identified in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and was shown to have an active role in antiviral defense against 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> C virus (DCV) and Flock House virus (FHV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Consistent with 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mosquitoes also express the cytokine receptor, Domeless (Dome) and the tyrosine kinase Hopscotch (Hop), which together induce the JAK-STAT pathway. The mechanism of the Dome receptor is similar to the mammalian JAK-STAT pathway. The ligand binds to Dome, which then undergoes a conformational shift leading to self-phosphorylation of Hop (JAK). Activated Hop phosphorylates Dome, which forms a docking site for cytosolic STATs. Recruitment of STATs by the Dome/Hop complex leads to the phosphorylation and release of the STATs. The phosphorylated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription of specific effector genes, such as the virus-induced RNA 1 (
 <italic>vir-1</italic>) gene, that has a role in antiviral immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Through reverse genetic approaches and functional studies, the JAK-STAT pathway has been shown to mediate increased resistance to DENV and ZIKV in infected 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Genetically modifying 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to overexpress Dome and Hop renders the mosquitoes more resistant to DENV infection, but not to CHIKV and ZIKV infections. These studies suggest that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> possess varied molecular responses to different viruses [
