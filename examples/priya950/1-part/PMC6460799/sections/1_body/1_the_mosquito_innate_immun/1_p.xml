<p id="Par38">The mosquito innate immune response is a key determinant for successful transmission of viruses. Unlike the mammalian immune system, mosquitoes do not possess adaptive immune responses and are dependent on innate immunity to fight viral infection. Most of the knowledge on insect antiviral innate immunity is elucidated from studies of the genetic model insect
