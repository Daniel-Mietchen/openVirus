<p id="Par56">As the fat body is important in mediating antiviral responses in mosquitoes, its components such as cellular lipids may play a role as well. It has been shown that cellular lipids are manipulated by flaviviruses to facilitate viral replication. In 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> cells, SINV and DENV infection resulted in accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. LDs are made up of a monolayer of fatty acid and other structural proteins including Perilipin 1, 2 and 3. LDs are found in the fat body tissue of mosquitoes and their main function is maintaining lipid homeostasis, by regulating biogenesis and degradation of LDs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. LDs serve as a reservoir of lipids which are important for anchoring the viral replication machinery for efficient viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Exploitation of lipid metabolism has also been reported in WNV, indicating the importance of lipids in pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Genes involved in LD biogenesis and lipid metabolism are upregulated upon DENV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Interestingly, activation of immune signaling pathway, including the Toll and the Imd pathways enhanced LD content in mosquito midgut [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. During DENV infection, fatty acid synthase is recruited to the site of replication by DENV nonstructural protein 3 to stimulate fatty acids synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Furthermore, inhibition of fatty acid synthase decreased DENV viral titers and thus serve as a potential antiviral target to control viral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>].
