<p id="Par52">The cellular defense response includes phagocytosis, nodulation and encapsulation of pathogens by hemocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, hemocytes also elicit humoral responses by activation of downstream signaling as previously mentioned and their effector responses lead to the synthesis and secretion of soluble effectors molecules such as AMPs and components of the phenoloxidase cascade into the hemolymph to control infection against invading pathogens [
