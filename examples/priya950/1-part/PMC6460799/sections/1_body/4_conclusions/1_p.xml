<p id="Par63">Currently there are no suitable vaccines nor cure for the majority of mosquito-transmitted diseases. Vector control remains the gold standard strategy to block disease transmission. More recently, genetically-modified mosquitoes have been developed and field tests are ongoing, as potential alternative strategies to control disease transmission by mosquitoes. However, these strategies are not perfect and insufficient to block transmission. Furthermore, as these strategies are still novel, little is known about how viruses and mosquito defense mechanisms may evolve to reduce the efficacy of these strategies. More extensive knowledge of how mosquitoes respond to infection, how the innate immune system controls virus infection, other host factors that facilitate viral replication, how viruses persist in mosquitoes and how different mosquito species or strains vary in permissiveness to virus infection at the molecular level could improve and maximize the effectiveness of current strategies and could possibly result in identification of new molecular targets for new vector control strategies. </p>
