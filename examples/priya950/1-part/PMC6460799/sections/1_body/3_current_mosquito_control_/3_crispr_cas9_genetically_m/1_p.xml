<p id="Par61">The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated sequence 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has recently emerged as a powerful genome editing tool to combat vector-borne diseases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. In addition, the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to genetically modify mosquitoes to combat mosquito-borne diseases is steadily growing. For example, the body of literature on the development of highly effective CRISPR/Cas9 systems has expanded significantly especially within the last five years since the emergence of this system. Briefly, the CRISPR/Cas9 system comprises two components: (i) a small RNA (17–20 bases) known as single guide RNA (sgRNA) that is designed to complement the target genomic DNA sequence; and (ii) 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 nuclease (SpCas9) that binds and cleave the double-stranded target DNA in the presence of a short conserved sequence (2–6 nucleotides), known as protospacer-associated motif (PAM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. The SpCas9 endonuclease complexes with the sgRNA and induces double-stranded DNA breaks at the target DNA sequence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. The PAM sequence for SpCas9 is NGG, and SpCas9 will not bind to the target DNA sequence if PAM is absent at the site. Interestingly, the frequency of NGG in the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genome is relatively high (approximately once every 17 base pairs). This feature makes CRISPR/CAS9 an efficient and reliable system to make precise changes to the genome of this vector species [
