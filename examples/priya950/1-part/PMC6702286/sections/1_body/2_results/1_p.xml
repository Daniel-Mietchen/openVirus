<p>A total of 1,498 cattle were sampled across the 2 study sites (Januaryâ€“May 2013 in the NWR and September-November 2013 in the VD). Eighteen samples failed the PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> test and a further seven failed the ID.Vet test due to excessive hemolysis leaving a final sample size of 1,473 for the remaining analyses. The raw continuous readings from the two tests are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and there is generally good agreement.
