<p>The Hui-Walter model assumes that the test performs the same in each population. To explore this we repeated the analysis at a site level running independent models for the NWR and VD. The resulting estimates are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and show that although these is some variation between the sites the specificities remain very high and the sensitivities a little lower with considerable uncertainty as might be expected from the smaller sample sizes but overall a very similar estimate across the two study sites. The prevalence estimates are almost identical to those from the single model estates shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. These have also been plotted on a map in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> to highlight the spatial variation in seroprevalence across the two sites.
