<p>Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic viral disease of ruminants, caused by a 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> in the 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> family. It was first described in Kenya in 1931, and has since been reported in many African countries, as well as the Arabian Peninsula (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It is considered one of the most important emerging zoonotic pathogens of public health significance affecting mainly African communities with low resilience to economic and environmental challenges (

The epidemiology is characterized by explosive epidemics in both humans and livestock populations usually associated with flooding or dam construction and long inter-epidemic periods where there is little evidence of viral presence in those populations affected by epidemics. Where the virus persists in these inter-epidemic periods is still a major gap in our understanding of the epidemiology of RVF (
