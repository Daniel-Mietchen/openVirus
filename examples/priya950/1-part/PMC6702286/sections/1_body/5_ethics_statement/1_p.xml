<p>The study design and sampling methodology was reviewed and approved by the University of Edinburgh Ethics Committee, UK (ERC No: OS02-13) and by the Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation (MINRESI), Cameroon. MINRESI gave permission to conduct the fieldwork and issued fieldwork permits. The research did not involve endangered of protected species and no further approvals were necessary to conduct fieldwork. All participants gave informed verbal consent to participate and were aware they could opt out at any stage. Verbal consent was deemed appropriate for the variety of dialects spoken, variable literacy amongst participants and due to the remote outdoor fieldwork environment. Information to be provided to participants, for informed verbal consent, was communicated to the interviewer in a written document. Additional training was provided to the interviewer regarding the consent procedure and interview process. Furthermore, the interviewer was experienced in conducting questionnaires in similar studies and spoke the various local dialects of study participants. Verbal consent was recorded on a cover sheet to the questionnaire by the interviewer and refusals were recorded in separate document along with reasons for refusal.</p>
