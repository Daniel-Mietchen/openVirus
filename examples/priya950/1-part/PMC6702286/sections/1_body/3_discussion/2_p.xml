<p>The model assumes that the tests perform the same in the different populations and the results support this when the sample was split and analyzed separately for each site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We have included conditional dependence since both tests are serology based as suggested by Toft et al. (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In addition, Toft et al. (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) warn about the potential inflation of the standard errors when the difference between the prevalences in the different subpopulations are small. In this study the range of prevalences is fairly wide therefore this should not be an issue. Finally, the model assumes all individuals are independent and does not account for clustering by herd which may lead to underestimation of the standard error and narrower BCIs. The specificity estimates are similar to those previously published for both the ID.Vet RVF ELISA (0.997) (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> (0.960) (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The estimates for the sensitivity of the ID.Vet RVF ELISA are lower than those published by Paweska et al. (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) who report a sensitivity of 0.963. Our results suggest that in this population it may perform less well but may be a better reflection of performance in a naturally infected population where we do not know the stage of infection and their is a wider range of infectious doses. Other ELISA tests are available including another competitive ELISA produced by Veterinary Medicine Research and Development (Washington State) which when compared to the PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> had similar sensitivities and specificities (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).
