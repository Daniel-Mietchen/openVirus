<p>Rift Valley fever is an important emerging zoonotic disease in sub-Saharan Africa whose epidemiology is still poorly understood and there is a need to evaluate low cost surveillance tools for LMIC settings such as Cameroon. Here we have compared 2 RVF diagnostic tests, an in-house PRNT and a commercial ELISA (ID.Vet) using a latent class approach in a Bayesian framework to deal with the problem of having no gold standard test. The analysis first compared the tests using two different cut-offs and identified the optimal combination of cut-offs for the two tests that were then used for the remainder of the analyses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). We also then compared their performances in geographically separated populations and also across age groups to assess consistency of performance and parameter estimates across these different groups. The results suggest that the tests perform consistently across the different groups with precise estimates of very high specificities and good sensitivities but with more uncertainty in these. There is some variation across the different subpopulation analyses, particularly in sensitivity estimates. This may be due to the relatively small numbers of positive animals per administrative area which results in stochastic noise when the sample is sub-setted by site and age.
