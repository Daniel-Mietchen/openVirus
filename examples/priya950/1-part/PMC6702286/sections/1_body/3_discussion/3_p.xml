<p>This represents the first report of estimating the ID.Vet RVF ELISA performance in an African cattle population and the ELISA shows great potential as a low cost easy to use surveillance tool with very good overall accuracy comparable to the more standardized PRNT
 <sub>80</sub>. Although generally considered the reference test and widely used in reference laboratories the PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> is labor-intensive, time consuming, expensive, and requires virus appropriate biocontainment (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and so it not practical for most surveillance activities particularly in LMICs. Laboratories with only very basic equipment can use the kit making it very appropriate for use in Africa.
