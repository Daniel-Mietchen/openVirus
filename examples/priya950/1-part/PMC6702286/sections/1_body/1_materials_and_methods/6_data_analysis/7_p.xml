<p>In a Bayesian analysis all parameters are given distributions. Hence, prior distributions for the test properties and the prevalences within the subpopulations must be specified. For prevalences where no information was available the distributions were modeled using a uniform distribution on the interval between 0 and 1 with a beta(1,1) distribution. The Se and Sp of the two tests were modeled using the priors Se
 <sub>1</sub>~Beta(20,1) and Sp
 <sub>1</sub>~Beta(5,1) for the ID.Vet ELISA based on published estimates of performance (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and vaguer priors Se
 <sub>2</sub>~Beta(5,2) and Sp
 <sub>2</sub>~Beta(10,2) were used for the RVF PRNT
 <sub>80</sub>. A sensitivity analysis was done to confirm that the priors were not overwhelming the posteriors and driving the estimates (see
