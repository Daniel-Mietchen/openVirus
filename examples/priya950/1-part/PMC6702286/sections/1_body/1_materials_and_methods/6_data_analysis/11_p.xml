<p>The model was implemented in JAGS using R (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Material S1</xref>). For this analysis the chains were used and the first 50,000 iterations were discarded as a burn-in. A further 250,000 iterations were run for each chain and then thinned by 100 to produce a set of 7,500 interactions kept for posterior inference. The parameter estimates are the mean of the posterior and the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles were used to give the Bayesian credibility intervals (BCI). Convergence of the chain after the initial burn-in was assessed by visual inspection of the time-series plots for the parameters, as well as Gelman-Rubin statistic and diagnostic plots of model convergence based on the three sample chains with dispersed starting values (
