<p>A cross sectional survey was conducted between January–May 2013 in the NWR and September–November 2013 in the VD. These were pastoralists whose herds were listed in the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries, and Animal Industries vaccination records at 81 local veterinary centers in the NWR and 31 in the VD in 2012. A total of 5,053 pastoralist herds in the NWR and 1,927 in the VD, with a range of 1–215 cattle per herd were included in the sampling frame. The list of herds in each site was stratified by administrative area; seven Divisions in the NWR and eight sub-Divisions within the VD and a random sample of herds was taken from each site proportional to the total number of herds listed in each of the two sites. This survey was part of a larger study of bovine tuberculosis and liver fluke and the sample size was based on a clustered random sample of cattle assuming a cattle level prevalence of ~10%, a within herd variance of 0.15 and between herd variance of 0.01, an average herd size of 70, a relative cost of 12:1 for herd:cattle and relative error of ±15% (Survey Toolbox; AusVet) (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This gave a target sample size of 15 cattle per herd and 88 herds under the simplifying assumption of perfect test performance. To allow for potential losses or drop out and to have balanced samples from the two sites, we aimed for 50 herds in each of the two sites in the NWR and VD. Within each herd the 15 samples were stratified to each of three age classes; &lt;2 years old (young), 2–5 years old (adult), and older than 5 years (old).
