<p>The study was conducted in two sites in the NWR and VD of the Adamawa Region of Cameroon. Both are of similar geographical size of ~17,000 km
 <sup>2</sup>. The NWR is situated in the fertile mountainous highlands, 500â€“3,000 m above sea level. Bamenda, the capital, is Cameroon's third largest city. The Region is densely populated (1,804,695 people) and an estimated 506,548 cattle are grazed there (

Veterinary services are predominately provided by the government through the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries, and Industrial Agriculture/Ministere de l'Elevage des Peches et Industries Animales (MINEPIA), with local veterinary technicians stationed at Zootechnical and Veterinary Sanitary Control Centers (ZVSCC) distributed across the country (
