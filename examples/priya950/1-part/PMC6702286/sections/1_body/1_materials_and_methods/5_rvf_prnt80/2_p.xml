<p>Neutralizing antibody response to RVFV was determined by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT
 <sub>80</sub>) modified from a previously described protocol (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Serial 2-fold dilutions of serum in DMEM were made starting from 1 in 40 to obtain duplicates of 100 μl/well for each serum sample. One hundred microliter of DMEM containing 100 PFU of RVFV was added to each serum dilution, mixed, and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and 95% relative humidity for 1 h. Two hundred microliter of the virus/serum mixture was then transferred onto a 48-well plate containing confluent Vero E6 cell monolayer and incubated for another 1 h. An overlay of 1.75% carboxymethylcellulose in DMEM containing 0.3% BSA was then added to all wells and plates incubated at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and 95% relative humidity. Assay of negative and positive control sera as well as a back titration of the virus was performed at the same time as the test sera. After 4–5 days the cells were fixed with 10% formalin, stained with 0.5% crystal violet and plaques counted. The reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that prevented at least 80% CPE was taken as the PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> titer for that sample.
