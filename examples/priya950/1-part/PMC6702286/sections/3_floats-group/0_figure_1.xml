  <p>Bivariate plot of the raw continuous values from the PRNT
   <sub>80</sub> and ID.Vet RVF tests. The points are colored by study site and jittered on the y axis. Horizontal and vertical lines in dashed red were added to mark the various cut-off values used. Note that for the PRNT
   <sub>80</sub> a positive result is greater than the cut-off while for the ID.Vet ELISA is lower than the cut-off.
