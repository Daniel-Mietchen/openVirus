<p id="Par10">Data have been analyzed using the ‘
 <italic>meta</italic>’ packages of the R statistical software (version 3.5.1, The R Foundation for statistical computing, Vienna, Austria). We used the reference method to synthetize prevalence data as recommended by Barendregt and colleagues

 </sup>. The prevalence of DENV infection has been recalculated on the basis of crude numerators and denominators provided by individual studies. To minimize the effect of studies with extremely small or extremely large prevalence estimates on the overall estimate, the variance of study-specific prevalence was stabilized with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation before pooling the data with the random effects meta-analysis model
 <sup>

 </sup>. Heterogeneity was assessed by the chi-square test on Cochrane’s Q statistic
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>, which was quantified by I-squares values, assuming I-squares values of 25, 50 and 75% respectively representing low, medium and high heterogeneity
 <sup>

 </sup>. When substantial heterogeneity was detected (I² &gt; 50%), we performed subgroup analyzes to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity using the following grouping variables: clinical presentation (febrile vs apparently healthy) and UNSD regions. The symmetry of the funnel plots and the Egger test have been used to assess the presence of publication bias
 <sup>

 </sup>. A 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.10 was considered indicative of a statistically significant publication bias for studies reporting the prevalence of dengue fever
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. It was decided a priori that if publication bias were present it would not be adjusted for, since we believed that the prevalence estimates of interest would likely be published even if substantially different from previously reported estimates. In the case of multinational studies, we considered data from each country as one study before the meta-analysis. This was also done in cases of studies including both febrile and non-febrile patients included in the same study. To assess the robustness of our findings, we conducted a sensitivity analysis considering only studies that used a confirmation analysis by PRNT.
