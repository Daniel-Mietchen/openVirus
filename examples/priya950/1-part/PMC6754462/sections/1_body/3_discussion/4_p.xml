<p id="Par20">We found a higher prevalence with IgG compared to IgM and RNA markers. RNA is detectable in patients only from infection up to six days after the onset of the fever. IgM are detectable five days after the onset of fever up to three months while IgG appear on the tenth day after the onset of fever and can persist for several years

 </sup>. The prevalence was not surprisingly higher in febrile compared to apparently healthy individuals, although not significant. This may be explained by the fact that the viral markers are more prevalent during febrile phase (first seven days). We found a higher prevalence of IgG in the febrile patients compared to apparently healthy. As IgG can stay several years in the serum, an episode of fever can occur in an individual who already had a previous infection (with IgG and IgM production), especially in the endemic context for DENV like Africa. During a new acute infection (a second and others after), the secondary immunological response is faster with a higher IgG production
