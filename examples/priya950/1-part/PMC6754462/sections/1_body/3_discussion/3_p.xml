<p id="Par19">The high prevalence we found in this review may reflect the weakness of the ongoing public health interventions to control vector transmission of DENV. This can be explained by weak health systems in a low-income context leading to inability to sustain efficient and continuously powerful interventions. In addition, in certain African countries any strategies were implemented to date for vector control

 </sup>. The increasing rate of urbanization in the continent can also explain the high DENV infection prevalence. Indeed, high urbanization rate with poor infrastructure in tropical and subtropical regions is associated with high burden of DENV infection
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. The mechanism would be the increase of mosquitoes breeding sites in these developing countries. The ecological environment and climatological patterns of tropical and subtropical regions where most of African countries are located also favor vector long-life and development
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Indeed, in warm and humid climate that favors eggs conservation and development, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictu</italic>s and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> are active all year long compared to cooler, temperate regions, where they hibernate over winter

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Another explanation and one of the most important for the high prevalence is the interaction between all factors evocated above in addition to the facilitation of international travelling due to development of transportation that favor the expansion of dengue vectors in Africa
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. One of DENV vectors, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, originally came from tropical and subtropical region of Southeast Asia. The presence of this vector in Africa has been facilitated by the development of international transport. For example, the tire trade between Asia, Europe, and Africa was the most favorable factor for the transfer of mosquitoes eggs from Asia or Europe to Africa

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. Definitively, in the last decades there is an increasing urbanization, increasing human exchange between countries and ecological imbalance favoring the infection of vectors, and then of other never infected humans.
