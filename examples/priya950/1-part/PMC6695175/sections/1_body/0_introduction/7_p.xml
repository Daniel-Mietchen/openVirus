<p>Here we used a phylogenetic approach to investigate DENV circulation in the southern provinces of Thailand during 2015â€“2016 and determine the origins and routes of introduction of the DENV strains. While previous studies focused on a single serotype [

 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or were restricted in certain areas in Thailand [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], our objective is to explore, for the first time, the local genetic diversity of the four DENV serotypes and determine whether new strains are emerging or if a switch of genotype is ongoing in Southern Thailand.
