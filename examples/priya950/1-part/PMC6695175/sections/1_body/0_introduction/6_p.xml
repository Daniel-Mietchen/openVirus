<p>Phylogenetic analysis of DENV sequences collected through surveillance allows monitoring of the spatiotemporal dissemination of DENV, which can show the potential rise of a specific genotype in an area or highlight a shift of genotype, as well as changes in virulence, vector competence, geographical adaptation and major epidemic episodes as previously reported [

 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In a DENV-ridden country, monitoring the circulation of the different strains should provide a better understanding of the dynamic of the virus and give clues on the impact of specific serotype/genotype in local epidemics.
