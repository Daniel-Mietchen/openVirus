<p>Despite the presence of DENV in the four regions of Thailand, Limkittikul 
 <italic>et al</italic> showed the heterogeneity of the geographical patterns of dengue desease from 2000 to 2011 [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This heterogeneity included serotype distribution variation in time and place, but also a periodic higher incidence rate reported in the south of Thailand compared to the other 3 regions. Southern Thailand is an important area for trade and tourism. The southern provinces of Narathiwat, Satun, Songkhla and Yala are land and air gateways into Thailand and are involved in the North-South terrestrial communication between continental Asian countries on the one hand and the large insular region of Southeast Asia (SEA) on the other hand.
