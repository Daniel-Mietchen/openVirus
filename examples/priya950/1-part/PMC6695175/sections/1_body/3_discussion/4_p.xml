<p>In the past few years, several studies have shown the replacement of DENV-3 genotype II by the genotype III in Southeast Asia [

 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Genotype III is now described as a widespread worldwide “Cosmopolitan genotype” with a high rate of dissemination upon introduction in a new area and has been linked to several outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our phylogenetic analysis of six DENV-3 samples resulted in their classification within genotype III, suggesting that this genotype replacement occurred in Thailand between 2012–2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221179.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Our strains showed a genetic diversity with two distinct lineages classified within genotype III. Indeed, five samples were closely grouped in a monophyletic lineage with strains isolated from Thailand, Laos and Vietnam between 2012 to 2017, while the single strain DC-125 clustered separately with a strain isolated in Malaysia in 2008. This separation in two lineages suggests different routes of introduction or different modes of circulation in Thailand as proposed by Tan 
 <italic>et al</italic> in Malaysia [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The strain DC125, closely related with the virus from Malaysia 2008, could have been introduced a few years ago and may have been circulating at a low level after its introduction in Southern Thailand. Furthermore, our observation in Southern Thailand corroborates the recent observations in the Central and Northern regions that also showed the establishment of genotype III [
