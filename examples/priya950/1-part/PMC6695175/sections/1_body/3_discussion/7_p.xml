<p>In conclusion, our study describes, for the first time, the genetic diversity of all four serotypes of DENV in Southern Thailand, providing important insights into their distributions in the region. We demonstrated that DENV is hyperendemic in Southern Thailand, rendering coinfection between serotypes and genotypes possible. We observed the co-circulation of multiple genotypes within DENV-2 to DENV 4: DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype co-circulated with Asian-I; DENV-3 genotype I with genotype III; and DENV-4 genotype I was prevalent while genotype II-B was detected after decades of absence. The observed re-emergence of several genotypes suggests constant movement and introduction of DENV strains in Southern Thailand. Our study urges further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> characterization of the local mosquito population to assess the possible gain of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> advantage for the new genotypes in Southern Thailand. Gain in vector competence may partly explain the difference in genotype distribution between the North and the South of Thailand. Our data highlights the high incidence of DENV serotype and genotype co-circulation, particularly in urban area, such as the city of Hat Yai and the area along the Malaysian border. It would be informative to evaluate how this hyperendemicity influences disease severity.
