<p>Following the same pattern as the DENV-3 strains, the DENV-4 strains were grouped into two genotypes: lineage (a) which groups nine samples in genotype I and the lineage (b) which groups six strains in genotype II clade B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221179.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This observation shows that lineage (a) is closely related with strains isolated during outbreaks in Singapore in 2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], in China from an imported case from Thailand (2013), Bali (2016) [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and also recently isolated strains from Northern Thailand [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Genotype I is commonly found in Thailand and continental countries of Southeast Asia. However, the observation of lineage (b) suggests a possible an introduction that did spread and not established in introduction of a new genotype into Thailand. Indeed, six samples were grouped together into a single lineage belonging to genotype II. This clade formed a monophyletic lineage related to the Southeast Asian and Australian strains. The last detection of this genotype in Thailand was reported in 2000 in Bangkok [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It should be noted that all these samples were collected in 2015 from the province of Songkhla and had a low phylogenetic diversity. This observation may suggest a singular introduction in time and place and not necessarily the emergence of a new DENV-4 genotype in Southern Thailand. However, further investigation would be necessary in order to follow the DENV-4 phylogenetic dynamic.
