<p>Of the 182 serum samples collected in the southern province of Thailand during 2015â€“2016, from patients presenting with dengue-like symptoms and confirmed positive for dengue by both NS1 serological test and RT-PCR, the envelope gene of 46 were successfully sequenced. The serotype was determined by nested RT-PCR, revealing the co-circulation of all four DENV serotypes in Southern Thailand (
