<p>Of the twenty DENV-2 samples, ten belonged to the Cosmopolitan genotype. These formed a monophyletic lineage that was closely related to strains isolated in Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka since 2013, as well as strains isolated from north and central parts of Thailand in 2016 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221179.g003">Fig 3</xref>, label b). The phylogenetic association of the Cosmopolitan genotypes with Southeast Asian countries and the Asian I genotype with China and Myanmar indicates spatial segregation of the DENV-2 genotypes within Asia, however both these genotypes overlapped in Southern Thailand.
