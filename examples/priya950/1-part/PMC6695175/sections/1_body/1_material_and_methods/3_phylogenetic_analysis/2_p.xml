<p>Overlapping reads were assembled into contiguous sequences using CAP3 Sequence Assembly Program [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Multiple sequence alignments were conducted using MEGA 7 [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Sequences were edited and sites that could not be unambiguously aligned were excluded from subsequent analyses. Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were constructed using PhyML software [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] with the best-fit nucleotide substitution model (GTR+G)identified by Akaike's Information criterion (AIC) using Topali v.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0221179.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Bootstrap method was used to measure the robustness of nodes with 1000 iterations. Phylogenetic trees were edited with FigTree v1.4.3 software (
