<p>To avoid working on viruses passaged and isolated from cell culture, we decided to directly sequence samples from viral RNA previously extracted from serum as mentioned above. Then, isolated RNA were retro-transcribed in cDNA using random hexamer and MMLV reverse transcription kit (Promega, Charbonnière, France), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Then, PCR was performed to amplify the full Envelope (Env) gene sequence using KAPA2G Fast Ready Mix (KapaBiosystem, Wilmington, MA, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions. The 1
 <sup>st</sup>-forward and 4
 <sup>th</sup>-reverse primers for each serotype were used to amplify Env gene sequences (

Amplification was performed using the following cycling conditions: activation at 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 amplification cycles of 95°C for 15s, 60°C for 15s and 72°C for 30s. PCR products were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel and specific amplicons were purified from gel using QIAquick PCR Purification kit (QIAGEN, Bangkok, Thailand) following manufacturer’s instructions and stored at -20°C until sequencing was performed. The entire envelope gene was successfully amplified for 46 samples. Purified amplicons were directly sequenced in both 5’ and 3’ directions using cycle sequencing and dye terminator methodologies by Macrogen company (Seoul, Korean). A set of eight overlapping primers for each serotype were used for sequencing (
