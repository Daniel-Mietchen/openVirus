<p>Modified mRNA vaccines based on ZIKV prM-E proteins have also been developed (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pardi et al., 2017</xref>). These modified mRNA vaccines present a next generation vaccine platform. This approach involves encoding wild type prM-E genes in an mRNA with a nucleoside 1-methylpseudouridine modification to avoid sensing by the host innate immune system. The modified mRNAs encoding ZIKV prM-E proteins are then encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles for efficient protein expression (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Richner et al., 2017</xref>). The mRNAs are then expressed in either HK293T or HeLa cells, resulting in the production of SVPs that can induce production of neutralizing antibodies. These modified ZIKV mRNA vaccines use non-self-amplifying mRNA that cannot integrate into the genome, unlike DNA vaccines. The vectors used are also non-infectious and just a small dose can induce effective immunization (

These mRNA vaccines have exhibited robust immunization and protection against ZIKV infection in both immunocompromised AG129 and C56BL/6 mice. ZIKV mRNA vaccine concepts are currently undergoing clinical trials and success would prove to be an important milestone in combating current and future ZIKV outbreaks.
