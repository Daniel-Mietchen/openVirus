<p>Another study suggested that the highly thermostable ZIKV E protein, unlike DENV E protein, may also be associated with neurovirulence (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kostyuchenko et al., 2016</xref>). The surface of DENV2 virus changed structurally when the virus was incubated at 37Â°C, whereas ZIKV virus particles remained structurally stable, most likely due to the tightly packed and complex interactions of ZIKV E dimers. The ability of ZIKV to survive harsh conditions may explain why the virus remains viable in different body fluids such as semen, saliva and urine (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson et al., 2016</xref>). The relative contributions of prM amino acid substitutions to E protein thermostability and consequent ZIKV structural biology are not yet well known. However, changes in prM protein structure may induce structural changes in E protein as E protein assembly is dependent on prM protein expression (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al., 2017</xref>). As the virus undergoes purifying selection in the environment, prM modifications might be responsible for the production of novel infectious viral particles that enhance virulence in the host, but this hypothesis needs to be empirically tested.
