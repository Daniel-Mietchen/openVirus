<p>Our results indicate that wild long-tailed macaques in Peninsular Malaysia are exposed to Zika virus but at low levels, without evidence of viremia. This finding suggests that long-tailed macaques are unlikely involved in maintaining Zika virus sylvatic cycles in Malaysia, although the long-term dynamics of Zika virus antibodies and infection (including shedding) in macaques is unknown. This information is arguably needed before an animal can be designated a reservoir (

 </xref>), but the effects against heterologous flaviviruses are poorly understood in wild macaques. Also, the circulation of Zika virus in macaques could be affected by the sylvatic cycles of other endemic flaviviruses. In conclusion, the low seroprevalence of Zika virus antibodies in long-tailed macaques reinforces the need to study other NHPs and mammals as reservoirs in Malaysia to elucidate Zika virus transmission and emergence.
