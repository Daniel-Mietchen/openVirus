<p>Briefly, after the arrival of European pioneers in the fifteenth century, novel infectious diseases arguably became the most devastating consequence of colonization because the indigenous American populations had no prior exposure to pathogens that had become common in Europe (Walker et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Multiple measles epidemics, therefore, devastated the indigenous American populations (Walker et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Nambulli et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Uhl et al. via a mixed approach of paleopathological, historical, molecular, and epidemiological evidence, reported that severe MeV epidemics in the indigenous American populations facilitated the jump of MeV to large domestic dog populations of urban environments in South America and the adaptation of the virus as endemic CDV (Uhl et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Also, historical records could prove that few years after that adaptation to South American dogs, CDV was transported to Europe in 1760, where it initially induced widespread epidemics with high mortality before becoming endemic (Jenner,
