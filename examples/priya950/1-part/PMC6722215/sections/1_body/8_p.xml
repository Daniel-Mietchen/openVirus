<p>Beyond the epistemological and/or scientific meaning of the geographical origin and date of CDV divergence, there are important clues that must be clarified to better understand the current impact of CDVs on interspecies transmission, animal conservation, and zoonotic potential (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). It is clear that unlike the MeV infection, which is maintained by a single host (humans), CDV has been widely proved to be a promiscuous pathogen-causing infection/disease in a vast array of carnivorous and non-carnivorous species (Martinez-Gutierrez and Ruiz-Saenz, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This promiscuity has been attributed to not only the capacity of the CDV hemagglutinin (H) to interact with host cellular receptors, such as SLAM in mononuclear cells and nectin-4 in epithelial cells, but also the similarity among species sequences of the receptors mentioned above (Rendon-Marin et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The amino acid similarity among mammal SLAM receptors, including marine mammals, is &gt;80% (Ohishi et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), thereby supporting the results of cross-species transmission. In addition, there is a lack of species-related variation in the nectin-4 sequences among humans, mice, and dogs because human nectin-4 could function as an

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
