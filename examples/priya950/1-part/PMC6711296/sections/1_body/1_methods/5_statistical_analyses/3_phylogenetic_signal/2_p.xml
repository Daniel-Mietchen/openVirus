<p>To assess the strength phylogenetic patterning in infection status for Ebolaviruses, we estimated phylogenetic signal as a measure of the statistical dependence among species' trait values owing to their phylogenetic relationships [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As infection status is a binary variable, we calculated the 
 <italic>D</italic> statistic of Fritz &amp; Purvis [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] using the function 
 <italic>phylo.d</italic> in the ‘caper’ package in R [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and the mammal supertree of Fritz 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A 
 <italic>D</italic> statistic equal to 1 indicates that the binary trait has a phylogenetically random distribution across the tips of the phylogeny, while a value of 0 indicates clumping expected by evolution under a Brownian motion model; however the values of 
 <italic>D</italic> may fall outside of this range. To test for significant departure from each of these null models, a randomization test with 1000 permutations of the data is performed and compared to the estimated 
 <italic>D</italic> statistic. Further, to assess phylogenetic signal in sampling intensity and predicted host status (both continuous variables), we used 
 <italic>fitContinuous</italic> in the ‘geiger’ package in R to estimate Pagel's 
 <italic>λ</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], a measure of phylogenetic signal that varies between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (phylogenetic dependence following pure Brownian motion along the observed tree).
