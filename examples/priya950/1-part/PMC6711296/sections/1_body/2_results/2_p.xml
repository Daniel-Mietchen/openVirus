<p>We were able to predict hosts with high cross-validation accuracy (AUC = 0.97) as a function of both species-level traits, centre of latitudinal range and sampling effort. Number of individuals sampled for Ebolavirus RNA was the most important predictor and strongly positively related to host status, as was the number of individuals sampled in sero-surveys, the fourth most important predictor (
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Hosts were most likely among species with ranges centred latitudinally between 4° and 7° N latitude, and were associated with small litters, large adult body sizes, long gestations, frugivorous diets, narrow diet breadth, early weaning, solitary or living in small social groups and narrow habitat breath (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180337F1">figure 1</xref>). To clarify the relationship between body mass and traits, we plotted the interactive effects of adult body mass on other relatively important life-history traits and diet (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180337F2">figure 2</xref>). The strongest interaction was between litter size and adult body mass such that hosts were most likely to be large-bodied with small litters and unlikely to be small-bodied with large litters. Although not as strong, gestation length and body mass interacted such that hosts had relatively long gestations and large body masses and, thus, were most likely among a small subset of species. Similarly, relatively large-bodied (more than 3 kg) frugivorous species were much more likely to be hosts than species with less than 40% frugivorous diet and lower body masses. The effect of diet breadth was also larger at adult body masses more than 3 kg. Trait patterns overall point to a slow pace of life and a frugivorous diet, but not necessarily to fruit bats. With the exception of duikers (

 <italic>A. derbianus</italic> was Ebolavirus-positive. While the majority of Ebolavirus-positive species (
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337TB2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) were either bats or primates, and both families include many frugivores, highly frugivorous (greater than 40% of diet) species are also found among the rodents, ungulates, and carnivores.
