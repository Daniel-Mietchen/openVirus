<p>The phylogenetic signal in host status, as measured by the 
 <italic>D</italic> statistic, was estimated to be 0.53 and indicated significant phylogenetic clumping intermediate between phylogenetic randomness (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and pure Brownian motion (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). Phylogenetic signal in sampling intensity was found to be fairly low (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.134), while phylogenetic signal in the predictions from the BRT was found to be relatively high (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.447). Overall, in our dataset relatively few non-bat species have tested positive (
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337TB2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>), and none as a result of virus isolation. This is likely owing to the variation existing among bats and across mammal clades with known Ebolavirus hosts. Of 76 non-bat mammal species assayed to date in our dataset, 10 have tested positive (total sampling effort ≅5536) for Ebolavirus infection, as compared to 26 of 99 bat species (total sampling effort ≅ 13 016). Clearly, the disproportionate representation of bats among known Ebolavirus hosts is, in part, owing to disproportionate sampling of bats compared to other animals, and across the mammal tree, variability in the prevalence of hosts among species surveyed must reflect to some degree phylogenetic patterns in sampling biases. Yet, large sampling biases notwithstanding, we find a role for (i) life-history features such as gestation length that may be linked to immune function that, in turn, determine survivorship, rates of viral shedding, and transmission; (ii) ecological factors related to exposure, such as fruit consumption; and, (iii) interactions or interrelationships between diet or other ecological factors and life-history.
