<p>Ebolavirus hosts are scattered across a number of distinct mammal clades, but concentrated among Old World fruit bats, primates and artiodactyls. Critically, these patterns must be considered in light of very biased sampling effort across mammal species. Taxonomic subgroups differ greatly not only in the number of species reported to have been sampled in the published literature, but also in the number of individuals sampled per species. Olson 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] found that bats represented 61% and rodents 27% of the 8040 mammals tested in sero-surveys, and 30% and 48% of 5309 mammals surveyed for viral RNA from 1976 to 2011. Detection of Ebolavirus sequences in members of Pteropodidae in 2005 skewed study effort toward these prime suspects. Reported sampling of just six species (

 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic>, 
 <italic>Micropteropus pusillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Epomops franqueti</italic>, 
 <italic>Hypsignathus monstrosus</italic>) exceeds 1500 individuals, yet fewer than 1000 individuals had been sampled in 20 other (insectivorous) bat species [

Publication bias against negative results may offset these apparent sampling imbalances to the extent that non-host species within our dataset have actually received greater sampling effort than is reflected in the literature. Nonetheless, documentation of those species surveyed, but found to be Ebolavirus-negative, is likely to be very incomplete, exacerbating biases in the record of which species and taxonomic groups have been investigated [
