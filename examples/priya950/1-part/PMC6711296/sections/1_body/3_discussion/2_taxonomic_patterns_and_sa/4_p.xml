<p>Survey type presents an additional issue in weighing the evidence of exposure to Ebolavirus across the mammal tree. In a review of studies, only bats, rodents and carnivores had tested positive in sero-surveys [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Few positives were detected in the first two groups (3.2%, 0.04%), whereas carnivores yielded a 24.1% positive rate despite fewer animals being sampledâ€”largely a function of domestic dogs. In RNA surveys, only bats have tested positive, but at a low rate overall (0.9%). By far the strongest evidence of exposure and potential to serve as hosts comes from surveys of live virus from mammal carcasses. Of 33 non-human primates, 13 artiodactyls, six carnivores and two proboscideans surveyed, over half the primates and 7.7% of artiodactyls tested positive. Furthermore, strong evidence directly links Ebolavirus-infected primate and duiker carcasses to the initiation of human outbreaks [
