<p>Hosts that tested positive for Ebolavirus tended strongly toward large bodies. This may be attributable to several mechanisms. Larger hosts: (i) have potentially higher contact rates with humans via bushmeat hunting and consumption—although more rodents less than 15 kg were harvested, mammals more than 15 kg comprised more than half of bushmeat biomass in a survey of tropical Africa by Fa 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [

While all four factors may play some part, the relationship of body size to the quantity of virus generated, the detectability of dead or moribund hosts in the environment and the immune correlates of size may be particularly important to susceptibility and transmission.
