<p>Since the first human case was identified in 1976, Ebolavirus has caused recurring human and animal outbreaks in Central Africa, and a major human epidemic in West Africa. Over the past two decades, the frequency of Ebolavirus spillover from animals to humans has increased [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and caused steep reductions in wild populations of chimpanzees and gorillas in central Africa [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite accumulating outbreaks, animal hosts and viral strains (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), the basic ecology of Ebolavirus remains poorly understood [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In particular, reservoir species and the wider community of possible host species remain cryptic [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Though recent work suggests that spillover events (in mammal hosts, including human spillovers) appear to have seasonal triggers [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180337C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the mechanisms driving spillover are still largely speculative.
