<p>To identify characteristics that may confer a propensity for carrying Ebolavirus between unknown reservoirs and human populations, we compiled a list of mammal species tested for exposure to Ebolavirus and corresponding data on life-history traits, movement and diet. Using an automated approach to measuring variable importance, we predicted host status among 119 species and mapped the taxonomic distribution of presumptive Ebolavirus hosts in continental Africa.</p>
