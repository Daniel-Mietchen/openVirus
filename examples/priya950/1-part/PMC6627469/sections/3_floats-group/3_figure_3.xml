  <p>(a) Analysis of inhibition of virus-receptor binding by BLI. Real-time kinetic analysis of virus binding to LAMP1 was performed by BLI. A representative experiment of concentration-dependent inhibition of virus binding by 
   <bold>15</bold> is shown as determined by the BLI wavelength shift. (b) Inhibition curves of compounds from left to right, 
   <bold>14</bold> (blue), 
   <bold>15</bold> (red, obstructed by 
   <bold>14</bold>), 
   <bold>18</bold> (purple), 
   <bold>12</bold> (green), 
   <bold>17</bold> (yellow), 
   <bold>10</bold> (orange), 
   <bold>8</bold> (brown), and 
   <bold>7</bold> (light purple), of the virus-receptor binding determined similarly as shown in (a).
