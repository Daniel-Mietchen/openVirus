<p>IAVs cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. The latter are caused by animal viruses that managed to cross the animalâ€“human species barrier. Prophylactic and therapeutic options against influenza are limited. Several approaches are being used, the most common of which is the vaccination strategy. This is a valuable approach for the seasonal IAV variants that are very common and infective, yet usually only life threatening for those with weakened immune systems. Vaccination is complicated by the large antigenic variation in HA and NA with currently 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes of varying antigenicity known.

 </sup> Also within HA and NA subtypes changes in antigenicity resulting from mutational variation (antigenic drift) are observed. Nevertheless recent progress was reported toward prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.

 </sup> In case of an epidemic, neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir or zanamivir can be used to reduce the illness symptoms and infectivity.
