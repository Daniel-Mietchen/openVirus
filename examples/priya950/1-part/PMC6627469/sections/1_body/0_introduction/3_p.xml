<p>While NA was proven to be a druggable target that yielded nanomolar inhibitors with improved glycomimetic and prodrug characteristics to overcome some of the challenges of carbohydrate drugs,
 <sup>

 </sup> the situation is different for HA. The adhesion protein binds only with millimolar affinities to sialylated glycan receptors. Binding has been observed to α2,6-SiaLAcNAc for the human type specific HAs or α2,3-SiaLAcNAc for avian type-specific HAs.

 </sup> The low affinities are a challenging starting point for a carbohydrate based drug development program, but also non-carbohydrate approaches have faced this challenge.

 </sup> The virus, however, binds with high affinity to tissue surfaces by using multivalency,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
 </sup> which increases its avidity to levels that enable infection. The multivalency effects involve the simultaneous binding of glycans to more than one of the three binding sites per HA trimer on the IAV surface but also the simultaneous binding of cell surface glycans to multiple HA protein trimers on the viral surface. The overall avidity effects are very strong

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
 </sup> and crucial for IAV. In that sense it is a logical step to attempt to block the viral infection via the HA protein with a multivalent inhibitor.
