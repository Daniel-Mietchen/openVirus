<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) causes the flu and poses a serious threat to human health. History has shown that the flu can lead to serious pandemics, with millions of deaths in 1918

 </sup> and a risk of future outbreaks of deadly variants.

 </sup> IAV contains two envelope glycoproteins that bind to sialylated glycans. The hemagglutinin (HA) is responsible for attachment of the virus to the tissue surface to be infected, and its specificity lies at the origin of the species specificity and tissue tropism of the virus, while it is also of importance for the viral fusion with the endosome.

 </sup> The neuraminidase (NA) is a glycosidase enzyme that removes the sialic acid group from glycans which leads to a release of the HA-based attachment

 </sup> and allows the virus to burrow through the protective mucosa and enter the cell. Importantly, the NA also allows the progeny virions to be released from the cell surface to infect other cells. A functional balance is needed between the binding and cleavage properties of NA and HA.
