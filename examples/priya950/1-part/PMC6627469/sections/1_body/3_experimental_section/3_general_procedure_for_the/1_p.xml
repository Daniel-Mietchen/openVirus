<p>The appropriate lactoside (1 equiv, ∼0.03 mmol) and UDP-GlcNAc (1.5 equiv) were dissolved in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.3, 2.5 mL) containing KCl (25 mM), MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> (2 mM), and dithiothreitol (1 mM). To this, 20 μL of CIAP (10 mU) and 50 μL of 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> β3GlcNAcT (β1-3GlcNAc transferase) were added. The resulting reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 14 h, followed by Biogel P-2 and silica gel (
 <bold>6</bold>) purification. The resulting GlcNAc glycan (0.007–0.017 mmol, 1 equiv) and UDP-Gal (1.5 equiv) were dissolved in MES buffer (100 mM, 300–500 μL) containing MnCl
 <sub>2</sub> (20 mM). To this, 30–50 μL of LgtB (β1-4Gal Transferase) was added. The resulting reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The reaction mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was purified by gel filtration over Biogel P-2 (eluent H
 <sub>2</sub>O).
