<p>The appropriate LacNAc derivative (1 equiv) and CMP-NANA (1.2–3.3 equiv per LacNAc unit) were dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5, 200–500 μL) containing MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> (20 mM). To this, PmST1 mutant P34H/M144L (α2-6 sialyltransferase, 20–50 μL) was added to the reaction mixture. Then the resulting reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant subjected to gel filtration over Biogel P-2 (eluent H
 <sub>2</sub>O). Fractions containing product were combined and lyophilized for further preparative HPLC (HILIC column) for

 <bold>14</bold>, 
 <bold>15</bold>, and
