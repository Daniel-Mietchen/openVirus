<p>The azido polymer (
 <bold>3</bold>) was dissolved in water followed by the addition of 
 <bold>7</bold> (3 mg, 1.3 equiv). CuSO
 <sub>4</sub>·5H
 <sub>2</sub>O (0.1 equiv) and sodium 
 <sc>l</sc>-ascorbate (0.3 equiv) were dissolved in water separately and added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was carried out at 100 °C with microwave radiation for 60 min. The solvent was evaporated, and the crude reaction mixture was purified by dialysis using a cellulose based dialysis cassette (MWCO: 2K) against deionized water for 3–4 days and freeze-dried to give a white compound (3 mg, 24%). The disappearance of the azide stretching peak in the IR spectra of the final compound confirmed that all of the azido groups had reacted.
