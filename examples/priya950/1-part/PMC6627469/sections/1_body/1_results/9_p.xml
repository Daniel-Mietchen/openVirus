<p>Besides the BLI assay, also a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay was performed using the H3-containg WU95 virus for a number of our compounds. Results are shown in

 </xref>. Overall the results show the same trends but the

 <sub>i</sub>â€™s for the most potent compounds 
 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> were not as low but still in the low micromolar range. It should be noted that the conditions are different in both assays, and especially multivalency effects can vary due to the in vitro assay conditions.
