<p>In addition to BLI experiments with an H3-containing virus (WU95), we analyzed the inhibitory activity of 
 <bold>14</bold> against another human virus (H1N1) and an avian H5N1 virus. The human H1N1 virus was efficiently and fully inhibited, although with a somewhat higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> (2.7 μM) than the H3 containing virus. In contrast the avian H5N1 virus could be inhibited maximally 50%, which probably relates to differences in the receptor-binding properties of the different viruses. The fact that full inhibition of H5N1 was not achieved is likely caused by this virus preferring binding to α2,3- over α2,6-linked sialic acids, both of which are present on the glycoprotein receptor, while the inhibitor contains α2,6-SiaLAcNAc.
