<p>In the sialyation of 
 <bold>13</bold> also the disialylated 
 <bold>15</bold> was obtained and purified as a useful reference compound. In our hands, performing the CuAAC conjugation with the sialylated building blocks such as 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold> was problematic, which is the reason for the strategy of performing the sialylation as the last step on the multivalent precursor.
