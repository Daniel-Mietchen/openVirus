<p>The above experiments were run in the presence of 10 μM neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) to inhibit the neuraminidase that could potentially cleave off the sialic acid moieties from the inhibitors. A direct comparison was made between experiments involving inhibitory concentrations (3 μM) of 
 <bold>14</bold>, 
 <bold>15</bold>, and 
 <bold>12</bold> in the presence of oseltamivir carboxylate, with the same experiments without the NA inhibitor. These experiments showed very similar degrees of inhibition. Repeating these experiments with a different IAV, i.e., VI75 (containing H3 from another H3N2 virus; see
