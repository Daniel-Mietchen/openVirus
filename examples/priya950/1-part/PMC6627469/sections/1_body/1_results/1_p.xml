<p>The synthesis started with the preparations of the building blocks shown in

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00303/suppl_file/jm9b00303_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supporting Information</ext-link>. Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>3</bold> are the core or scaffold structures outfitted with azido groups. The other compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>8</bold> are the glycans that contain alkyne groups for linkage to 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>3</bold> by CuAAC conjugation. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> represents a trivalent scaffold derived from a known triamine
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
 </sup> with the potential to display three glycans toward all three HA binding sites of the trimer. Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> is a divalent spacer with rigid elements such as a direct linkage between glucose and triazole, a motif that was previously explored in rigid spacers for enhanced multivalency effects.

 </sup> Compound 
 <bold>3</bold> is a polymeric dextran scaffold
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
 </sup> for comparison with the “small” molecule scaffolds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>. Compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>5</bold>, and 
 <bold>8</bold> were made from propargyl lactose, and 
 <bold>7</bold> was made from LacNAc, and azidolactose and 1,4-diethynylbenzene were the starting materials for 
 <bold>6</bold> via CuAAC. The β1,3-linked GlcNAc and β1,4-linked Gal moieties of 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, and 
 <bold>8</bold> were introduced using glycosyl transferases. Similarly, the α-2,6-linked sialic acid part of 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold> was added using a sialyl transferase.
