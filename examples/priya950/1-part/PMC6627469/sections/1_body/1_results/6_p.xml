<p>Compounds 
 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> were the most potent in the assay, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.7 μM, representing a 428-fold enhancement over reference 
 <bold>7</bold>. The two compounds were strikingly similar in the assay, clearly indicating that two sialic acid groups were sufficient and that simultaneous binding to all three HA sites with 
 <bold>14</bold> was not achieved. The fact that both compounds were similar indicates that the expected statistical advantage of 
 <bold>14</bold> is compensated by other factors. The trivalent compounds with the shorter linker 
 <bold>12</bold> and shorter ligand moieties 
 <bold>10</bold> were considerably weaker inhibitors with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.3 and 15 μM, respectively, indicating the importance of the length of the arm. The divalent scaffold 
 <bold>2</bold> contains a similar number of atoms separating the azido groups as trivalent scaffold 
 <bold>1</bold>. Notably, the compound based on 
 <bold>2</bold>, i.e., 
 <bold>17</bold>, had very similar potency when compared to the one derived from 
 <bold>1</bold>, i.e., 
 <bold>10</bold>. This result again indicates that divalent binding is likely. Furthermore, it indicates the importance of the length of the arm, as the longer arms lead to enhanced inhibition. Interestingly, the polymeric glycoconjugate 
 <bold>18</bold>, while a potent inhibitor with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.5 μM, was weaker than the tri- and divalent 
 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> and much more so when corrected for valency, as the relative potency per sugar is only 3.75.
