<p>First to note is that the inhibition with the two reference compounds 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold> showed relatively low IC
 <sub>50</sub>’s below the millimolar level that is commonly associated with the binding of sialic acid derivatives to whole virus or HA. Another notable fact is that the inhibition of the two compounds is very similar, indicating that the added lactose moiety of 
 <bold>8</bold> does not help the binding. Another reference compound was 
 <bold>13</bold>. It contains the triphenylbenzene core linked to the LacNAcLac arms. The combined presence of the hydrophobic aromatic core and the 12 sugar moieties did not yield any detectable inhibition in the assay up to the 20 μM used in the assay.
