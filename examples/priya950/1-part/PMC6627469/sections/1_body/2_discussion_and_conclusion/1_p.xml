<p>We here showed the successful synthesis of multivalent sialic acid containing glycoconjugates. Their synthesis was possible by a combination of chemical scaffold synthesis, enzymatic carbohydrate synthesis, and CuAAC conjugation. The well-defined systems were found to inhibit the binding of IAV in a dose dependent manner. Clearly a combination of structural features is needed for inhibition as a single sugar arm is weakly active and the non-sialyl system is not active. Enhancements of 428-fold were achieved with the system containing two or three sialic acid units. Furthermore, the use of divalent systems showed similar results to experiments performed with trivalent systems. Therefore, not all three binding sites can be occupied simultaneously by our system, but two seem possible, as previously indicated for large biantennary glycans

 </sup> The length of the glycan arm is an important factor in the potency.
