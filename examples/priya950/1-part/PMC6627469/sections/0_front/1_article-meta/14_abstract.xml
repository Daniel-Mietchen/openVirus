 <p>Multivalent carbohydrate-based ligands were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of the adhesion protein HA of the influenza A virus (IAV). HA relies on multivalency for strong viral adhesion. While viral adhesion inhibition by large polymeric molecules has proven viable, limited success was reached for smaller multivalent compounds. By linking of sialylated LAcNAc units to di- and trivalent scaffolds, inhibitors were obtained with an up to 428-fold enhanced inhibition in various assays.</p>
