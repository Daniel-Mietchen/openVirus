<p>To conclude, we have investigated both how the spatial scale of control strategies and the choice of neighborhoods which are included in interventions may influence the efficacy of control in limiting outbreak size. Our results suggest that the overall best choice of strategy will largely depend on decision-makersâ€™ willingness and ability to invest in control measures (which is likely to be location specific and may even vary within cities, depending on the organization of vector control), and the efficacy of control methods. The spatial configuration or distribution of control (i.e., the neighborhoods whose inclusion in scenarios were likely to increase the effectiveness of the scenario) appeared to differ by urban center, where for San Juan (a relatively smaller city) and to a somewhat smaller extent Recife, the inclusion of neighborhoods was at least in part driven by the human population size, whereas targeting based on this factor became less important in Jakarta. While this finding needs further investigation, it adds to the conclusion that there will be no one-size-fits-all optimal solution for vector control strategies between different environments. Further work is needed to determine how such strategies should be structured, and to what extent that will vary between different urban centers of different sizes, distributions, and movement patterns of humans, under different frequencies of introductions of pathogens, and tailored to individual environmental, seasonal, and entomological settings.</p>
