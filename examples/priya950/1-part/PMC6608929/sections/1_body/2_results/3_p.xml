<p>We additionally performed simulations where we assumed that control would not be feasible in a proportion of randomly chosen and varied neighborhoods (20%). Based on this we can investigate what the relative impact is of including or excluding specific neighborhoods from the control responses. Our results suggest (and support findings from a different model and scenarios [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] that the spatial configuration of control also impacts the effectiveness of the control response (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007479.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). This is likely due to the connectivity structures of the patches (derived from a gravity model). In part, this also appears to relate to the population size of each specific neighborhood (

 <sup>

 </sup> = 0.56) and particularly Jakarta (

 </sup> = 0.11). In these larger environments, other factors (e.g., distribution of patches) likely become more prominent.
