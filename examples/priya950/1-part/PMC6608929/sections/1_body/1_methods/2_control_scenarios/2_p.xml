 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we assume detection occurs only for a proportion of infections, based on draws from a binomial probability distribution with probability of success of 0.5), control is initiated after 1–30 days (randomly chosen for each simulation) to reflect a time delay associated with factors such as laboratory processing of samples, the incubation period of the virus, and health-seeking behavior of symptomatic individuals. To focus on the impact of the spatial configuration and scale of control, we used the same control method in each scenario. Specifically, we assumed larval control (e.g., the application of pesticides to larval development sites) was used, modifying the base rate of death of larvae as follows:
