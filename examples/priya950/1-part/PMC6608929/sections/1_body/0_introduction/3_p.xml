<p>Human behavior also plays a critical role in determining the outcome of (re)emerging epidemics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. One type of behavior that influences both the global spread of pathogens and local clustering of cases relates to human movement, both in the form of local commuting and travel or migration over longer distances. In the case of vector-borne diseases the dispersal of vectors also has to be considered in interaction with the movement across different scales by human hosts, which can shape local patterns of transmission intensity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and contribute to the heterogeneity in exposure levels typical of vector-borne disease transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In general, the implications for disease spread become complex once contacts between individuals are clustered in some manner (e.g., for spatial, household or sociological reasons) instead of assuming random or well-mixed populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the case of vector-borne diseases, such heterogeneous patterns in exposure to infective bites can have implications for disease surveillance, estimates of risk, and control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For instance, if transmission hot spots and vector population sources and sinks occur in a particular vector-borne disease system, these could potentially provide targets for control interventions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Considering the movement of humans could therefore conceivably improve our ability to target both the areas of origin and the areas where onward transmission may occur [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], or at least to help reduce costs associated with those efforts.
