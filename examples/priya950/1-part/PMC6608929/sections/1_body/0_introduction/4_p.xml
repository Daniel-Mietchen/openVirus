For instance in Iquitos, Peru, clusters of dengue tended to be observed on greater than a 100 m radius, therefore likely involving a combination of both mosquito and human movement [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Other studies have supported the notion that movements within urban areas shape transmission and risk of exposure. For instance, visiting areas of risk, rather than the location of the home, was identified as a key driver of exposure to dengue in Iquitos [
