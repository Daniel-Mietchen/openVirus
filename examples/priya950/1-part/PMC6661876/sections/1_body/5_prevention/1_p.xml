The study found that the vaccine was associated with a 92% reduction in H7 positivity rates among poultry and a 98% reduction in human H7N9 cases. So, vaccination is still an effective way to prevent influenza. Most of the current vaccines are trivalent vaccines or tetravalent vaccines, including inactivated whole virus vaccines, split vaccines, subunit vaccines and live attenuated vaccines. The vaccines currently under development are divided into the following categories: (1) Vaccines that respond to antibodies in the conserved regions of HA and M2e structures, mainly to prevent infection; (2) Vaccines that produce cross-protective T cell responses to internal proteins such as NP and M1, mainly to reduce the severity of the disease.
