<p>In recent years, the sequencing of pathogenic microbial genomes has gradually become an important tool and means in the field of clinical microbiology. Applications include: rapid identification of pathogens, pathogen genomic variation, pathogen drug resistance monitoring and so on. Next-generation gene sequencing (NGS) technology can be a useful tool to accurately identify virus subtypes from the clinical specimens. Seong

Nasopharyngeal swabs from patients were collected for molecular epidemiological analysis. Total of 7 to 12 million reads were obtained; however, 3â€“4% of reads originated from a non-human source. A BLAST search of the contigs revealed high sequence similarity to pandemic H1N1 virus sequences, and indicated that most contigs were originated from human and bacterial sources. Therefore, the application of NGS technology in clinic about viral infection will become more and more extensive.
