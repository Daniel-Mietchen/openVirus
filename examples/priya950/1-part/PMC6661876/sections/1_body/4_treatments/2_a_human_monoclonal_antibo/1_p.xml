<p>The team of Professor Ying Tianlei from the School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, reported a human monoclonal antibody-m826, which could bind to H7 HA and protect against H7N9 infection. M826 binds to H7N9 HA with subnanomolar affinity at acidic pH and 10-fold lower affinity at neutral pH, which indicated that M826 is pH-dependent in combination with HA. M826 fully protects mice against lethal challenge with H7N9 virus through mechanisms likely to be involving antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). M826 is a germline antibody, and m826-like sequences can be identified in H7N9-infected patients, healthy adults, and new born babies. These m826 properties can also offer a template for H7N9 vaccine.[
