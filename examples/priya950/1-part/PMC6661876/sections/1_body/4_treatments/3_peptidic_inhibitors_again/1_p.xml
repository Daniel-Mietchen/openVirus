The peptide design was based on complementarity determining region (CDR) loops of anti-HA human broadly neutralizing antibodies, FI6v3 and CR9114. The optimized peptides exhibit nanomolar affinity and neutralization against influenza A viruses including H1N1 and H5N1. These peptidic compounds and their advantageous biological properties should accelerate development of novel small molecule and peptide-based therapeutics against influenza virus.
