<p>ECMO is the ultimate respiratory support method and can directly improve the oxygenation and ventilation of patients. ECMO was the breakthrough treatment for the severe avian influenza A (H1N1) outbreak of 2009 and reduced mortality from this outbreak. A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted by Huang

 <xref rid="j_jtim-2019-0012_ref_029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In this study, 23 patients with an average PaO2/FiO2 of 78 ± 23 mmHg had undergone invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). After 48 hr on ECMO, PaO2 improved from 56 ± 21 mmHg to 90 ± 24 mmHg and PaCO2 declined from 52 ± 24 mmHg to 38 ± 24 mmHg. Therefore, ECMO is effective at improving oxygenation and ventilation of patients with avian influenza A (H7N9) induced severe ARDS. Early initiation of ECMO with appropriate IPPV settings and anticoagulation strategies are necessary to reduce complications.
