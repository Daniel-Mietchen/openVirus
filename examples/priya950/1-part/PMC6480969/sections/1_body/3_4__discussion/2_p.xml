<p>To verify our discoveries and explanations quantitatively and to acquire quantitative relationships between road traffic, as well as socioeconomic factors and the spread of influenza A (H1N1), we conducted spatial regression analyses. When the cumulative incidence was taken as a response variable in the spatial autoregressive model, the results could be interpreted as follows: People had more chances to contact each other and transmit infectious diseases with a higher base probability in cities of a higher population density [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which resulted in a higher cumulative incidence at the end of epidemics. The income level in these cities was also higher [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and more workers would be attracted to come. It has been previously reported that the density of medical facilities was not significantly associated with the arrival time of the first confirmed influenza A (H1N1) case in each Chinese county in 2009 [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our findings elaborate on this, showing that the density of hospitals has a significant effect on the cumulative incidence at the city level. As we know, cities with more (high-level) hospitals would attract more patients seeking medical treatment [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, many symptomatic patients gathered in hospitals where the space was confined, and cross infection and nosocomial infection by means of virus droplet and aerosol could be facilitated [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which would also result in a higher incidence. Previous research [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported that people between 5–24 years old were most affected by the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in China. Therefore, our positive association between the proportion of college students and cumulative incidence is consistent with previous works. Cities with a higher 
 <italic>SumRatio</italic> were more likely to be traffic hubs in the national highway network, and the cumulative incidence would be higher. The larger the 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic> of a city, the lower the medical treatment level would be, and the cumulative incidence could not be reduced quickly and would remain relatively high. As for cities with a high GDP, they would tend to conduct stronger intervention measures to control the infectious disease, reducing the cumulative incidence. When the onset week was taken as a response variable in the spatial regression, we found that the population density and the number of pigs had negative effects on the epidemic onset in cities. A higher population density meant that the corresponding city was more central and it might have been more likely to have a large airport or train station, and then, the imported cases which could start an epidemic in the city might arrive earlier. The “first” reported case may not be the true first person who was infected by the influenza virus in a given city. It is possible that an infected individual arrived in a city and infected others around him/her, but the public health authority did not receive an infection report, and then, the epidemic started silently and developed freely. Thus, the “first” case was not announced to the public until the underlying infected population had taken place. As the reservoir of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, pigs can carry this virus, can transmit it to human beings, and may be a magnifier of the population of virus and potentially infected people. Hence, the “first” case would be reported earlier in a city where more pigs were fed. When the duration from onset to the first epidemic peak was taken as the response variable in the spatial regression, the results can be interpreted as follows and be supported by the finding in Reference [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] that the periods of epidemics in smaller cities are shorter than those in larger cities. A city with a high population density would have a high proportion of susceptible people who are fuel for epidemics [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which would prolong the duration of an epidemic. It was reported that school students were more susceptible to the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) than other age groups in China [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and that schools were high-risk areas for influenza outbreaks and should be the focus for prevention [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, the result that the number of colleges was positively associated with the epidemic duration is consistent with the real situation. Moreover, cities with a larger value of 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic> would have a smaller population, and the number of susceptible people would also be less. As a result, the epidemic duration would be shorter. Intervention measures of public health authorities in China could shorten the epidemic duration, but these measures were taken upon human beings instead of pigs, which played a role of viral reservoir. The virus might spill over from pigs to the human population continuously, which would prolong the epidemic period. It may be an explanation for the significantly positive association between the number of slaughtered pigs and epidemic duration. In addition, it has been reported recently that the presence of airports and railway stations in prefecture-level cities did not have significant impacts on epidemic duration [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our results complement previous findings and reveal that both road transport and socioeconomic factors had a significant influence on epidemic duration.
