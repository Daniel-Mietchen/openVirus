<p>It is interesting to note that the number of newly reported cases peaked at a time point later than the peak of the number of newly affected cities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01223-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Our explanations of this finding is that before week 34 (until 23 August) in 2009, the number of cases was quite small and increased very slowly (255 cases per week); the number of affected cities increased steadily (10 cities per week), which was most likely to be driven by the sporadic importation of overseas cases into China, because the majority of new cases before week 30 (until 26 July) were imported cases [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. From week 35 to week 44 (until 1 November), the increase in the number of new cases sped up significantly (6126 cases per week) and reached its first peak on 27 September, and the large amount of existing cases greatly facilitated the invasion of the virus into unaffected cities; hence, the number of affected cities increased more quickly (18 cities per week) than in the prior period. This could be explained by two possible reasons. The first may be that almost all the new cases were local cases after week 36 (until 6 September), which meant the community transmission of the virus within a city had started, so the number of weekly newly affected cities arrived in its peak on 6 September and the rate of increase dropped afterwards. The second reason could be that the Chinese government took strict prevention and control measures before September 2009, but the measures were relaxed from September [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which could also partly explain the sharp rise in the number of new cases and newly affected cities at the end of August and the beginning of September. The curve of new cases did not rise continuously but dropped to a local minimum in early October, which may be explained by the reduced case reporting during Chinese National Holidays [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and could further enlarge the time delay between its peak and the peak of the number of newly affected cases. From week 45 to week 53 (until 31 December), no city was newly affected because almost all prefecture-level cities (except for Yushu City in Qinghai Province) in mainland China had already reported cases in the prior period, and the increasing velocity of the number of new cases was nearly twice of that in the earlier period.
