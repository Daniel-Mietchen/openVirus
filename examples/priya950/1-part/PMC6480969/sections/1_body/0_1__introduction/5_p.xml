<p>In this study, we constructed a national highway network including 333 prefecture-level cities in mainland China and extracted three epidemiological variables (cumulative incidence, onset week, and duration of epidemics) and 14 socioeconomic factors (related to population, income level, medical condition, livestock breeding, and school education) in each city. We calculated four classic centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality) for each city in the network and proposed two new measures (
 <italic>SumRatio</italic> and 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic>). We first evaluated the correlation between the centrality measures and epidemiological features, and then used spatial autoregressive models to investigate the impacts of road network and socioeconomic factors on the diffusion of the 2009 influenza pandemic.
