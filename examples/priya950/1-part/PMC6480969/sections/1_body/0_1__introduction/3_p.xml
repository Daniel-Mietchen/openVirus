<p>Road traffic is considered to play an important role in the spread of infectious diseases. City traffic can be modelled as a road network to help simulate the transmission of airborne diseases in a city [

In the United States, the genetic distances between seasonal influenza A (H1N1) viruses were found to correlate with the distances along those parts of the interstate highways most used by commuters, along which only 1% of commutes occurred over distances of more than 242 kilometers, and the role of this road-based travel in facilitating influenza transmission should not be neglected [

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, the confined space in buses and cars are more limited than that in trains, and the vehicles are usually more crowded and filled with stagnant air, which may facilitate infection to fellow travelers [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in spite of air filters as an effort to reduce potential virus aerosol concentrations.
