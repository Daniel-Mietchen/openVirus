<p>We calculated four common network node centrality measures for each city node, including the degree, which is the number of nodes directly adjacent to it; the betweenness, which is the number of shortest paths that pass through the node; the closeness, which is the sum of the shortest distances (geodesic paths) between that node and all other nodes in the network; and the eigenvector centrality, which is a measure of the influence of a node in a network [

 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in the R program [
