<p>The suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) used in this study were obtained from the surveillance system of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, with dates ranging from week 19 (May) in 2009 to week 53 (December) in 2010. Every data entry represents a case with attributes, such as the date of onset, date of birth, and address together with a corresponding administrative area number. MATLAB [

 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] were used to extract information concerning the cumulative incidence which is the cumulative number of daily reported cases during the above time period divided by the population at risk, the onset week which is defined here as the week when the first case in a city was reported, and the duration which is the time from onset to the first epidemic peak, all in a certain prefecture-level city.
