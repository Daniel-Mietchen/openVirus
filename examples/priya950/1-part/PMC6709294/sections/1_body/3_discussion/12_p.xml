<p>Early diagnosis of hepatitis infections is critical for effective treatment and care. The DIAHV has recommended that to define a seropositive HCV infection status, a positive anti-HCV screening test result should be confirmed by a positive HCV RNA assay.

 </sup> HCV RNA testing was not performed on the specimens in the current study. Nevertheless, recent studies have proposed the use of signal-to-cut-off (S/CO) ratios of screening-test-positive results as an alternative to a supplemental test in some circumstances, minimizing the number of specimens that require supplemental testing and providing a result that has a high probability of reflecting the person's true antibody status.

 </sup> Recent studies have shown that a Elecsys Anti-HCV II S/CO ratio within 12.27 to 19.0 is predictive of a true positive result in â‰¥95% of the cases.
