<p>Both HBV and HCV infections are hepatotropic infections and share common routes of transmission.

 </sup> Being unaware of these routes of transmission imply a high risk of acquiring these infections and also unknowingly transmitting them to others. Although the major HBV transmission route in Brazil is unprotected sexual intercourse,

 </sup> accounts for most of the infections acquired in the country; however, approximately one-third (n = 11,876) of the study population was unaware of this information. We also observed lack of knowledge regarding well-known routes of transmission

 </sup> (i.e., blood transfusions, sharing nail technician instruments, sharing razor blades or waxing and obtaining tattoos or piercings). Similarly, other studies have already demonstrated a low level of knowledge about viral hepatitis, suggesting the need for strategies to increase access to information, such as awareness campaigns targeted towards this population.
