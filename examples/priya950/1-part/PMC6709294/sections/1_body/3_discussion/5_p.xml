<p>In our study, the estimated anti-HCV seroprevalence rate among the Brazilian conscripts was 0.28% (n = 101). This prevalence is lower than the overall HCV antibody prevalence of 0.7% obtained in a previous survey among Brazilian conscripts (Villar, 2015) or the estimated prevalence of 1.38% for both sexes in the Brazilian population, reported from a cross-sectional study.
