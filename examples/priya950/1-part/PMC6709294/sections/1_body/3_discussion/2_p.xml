<p>Since 2003, all cases of viral hepatitis detected in Brazil are subject to compulsory notification on the national notifiable diseases information system (SINAN). Data from the passive notification-based system are not sufficiently reliable to estimate infection rates in the general population since a large number of viral infections are asymptomatic, the etiology of notified symptomatic cases cannot always be confirmed, and most surveys are conducted in restricted geographical areas.

 </sup> In 2016, the WHO released the 
 <italic>Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis, 2016â€“2021</italic> (WHO, 2016). The goal of the strategy is to eliminate viral hepatitis as a major public health challenge by 2030.

 </sup> Brazil has signed on to implement the goals outlined in this document, and has since established its own action plans towards meeting these goals. One of the action plans involves estimating cases of hepatitis at the national level, based on epidemiological data.
