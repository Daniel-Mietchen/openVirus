<p>The estimated HBsAg and anti-HCV seroprevalence rates across the country by region are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The estimated HBsAg rate was 0.22% (n = 77), ranging from 0.04% in the South to 0.49% in the North Region. The estimated anti-HCV seroprevalence rate was 0.28% (n = 101). The Central-west Region presented the highest anti-HCV seroprevalence rate (0.65%, n = 18), followed by the South (0.42%, n = 21) and North Regions (0.40%, n = 13). From 101 anti-HCV positive individuals, 96 presented a low-positive result (S/CO &lt; 10.00) and 5 presented a high-positive result (S/CO≥10.00). No patients were found to be simultaneously HBsAg and anti-HCV positive.
