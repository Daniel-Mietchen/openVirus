<p>Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> summarizes the risk factors associated with a positive HBsAg and an anti-HCV positive status among conscripts, when compared to a negative HBsAg and anti-HCV status. Among the anti-HCV positive conscripts, 53% (n = 51, 0.56%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .049) reported they had never had sexual intercourse, vs 12% (n = 6, 0.07%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .343) in the positive HBsAg group. Regarding self-reported STI status, the vast majority of positive anti-HCV (n = 100, 0.29%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and positive HBsAg (n = 76, 0.22%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .205) conscripts reported not having a STI. From those conscripts who tested positive for HBsAg, 89% (n = 42, 0.28%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .005) reported not making consistent use of condoms with steady partners. Although not statistically significant, this behavior was conserved with any partner, except with paid partners (sex workers) or when receiving payment to have sex, where condom use was 26% (n = 7, 0.38%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .868) and 29% (n = 8, 0.39%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .694), respectively. Among anti-HCV positive conscripts, 40% (n = 12, 0.15%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .594) reported the use of condoms with steady partners, 36% (n = 9, 0.12%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .245) with casual partners, and only 26.7% (n = 12, 0.13%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .520) with any partner.
