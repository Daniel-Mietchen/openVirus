<p>All analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics, version 22.0 software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). The analyses incorporated data weighting, clustering (as selection commissions with different sizes were included), and stratification. Since the dataset was obtained using a complex sampling procedure that combined stratification and clustering, the design of the survey was incorporated into the statistical analysis of the data. Additionally, a calibration procedure was applied for the samples according to the census distribution by population size of the city of residence (less than 80,000 inhabitants, 80,000â€“199,999 inhabitants, and equal to or greater than 200,000 inhabitants), and educational levels.</p>
