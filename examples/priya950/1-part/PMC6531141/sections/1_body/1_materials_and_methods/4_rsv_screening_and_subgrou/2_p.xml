<p>For RSV screening, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed with primers RSV-NF and RSV-NR to amplify a 279 bp fragment of the RSV N gene.

 </sup> Subgroup-specific products were amplified with the subgroup A-specific 5′-primer RSV-GPA, and subgroup B-specific 5′-primer RSV-GPB and 3’ primer RSV-GF.

 </sup> Briefly, 2.5 μL of cDNA was added to a 22.5 μL PCR master mixture containing 12.5 μL Premix, 0.5 μL GPA primer (GPB primer), 0.5 μL RSV-GR primer and 9 μL ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O. The thermocycling protocol was 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 98°C for 10 seconds, 50°C for 10 seconds (for RSV-A) or 55°C (for RSV-B) for 10 seconds and 72°C for 1 minute, with a final extension for 7 minutes at 72°C and hold at 4°C. The amplified products of 550 bp were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel was stained with nucleic acid stain (SBS Genetech, Shanghai, China) and visualized under UV light.
