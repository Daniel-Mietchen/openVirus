<p>From December 2010 to June 2017, 2175 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from outpatients and inpatients children aged 1 month to &lt;5 years with ARTI in the Gansu Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital (Lanzhou, China). Demographic and clinical data were taken from the medical files. Informed consent was sought from the children's parents for participation in the study and it was approved by the ethics committee of the hospital. A 3-point (0–2, age adjusted) clinical severity score based on use of supplemental oxygen, duration of hospital, and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) was determined on admission.
