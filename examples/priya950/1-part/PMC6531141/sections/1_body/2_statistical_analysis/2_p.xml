<p>We explored associations among demographic, clinical, or outcome variables and RSV genotypes for all RSV-positive cases. Significant differences in rates between various groups were tested with a χ

 <italic>t</italic> test, and a Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test. The index of severity was tested by logistic regression. A 
 <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Analyses were performed with SPSS 17.0 software.
