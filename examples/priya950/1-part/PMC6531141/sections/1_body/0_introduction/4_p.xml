<p>So far, researchers from all over the world have detected 2 novel RSV genotypes (BA and ON1) with large duplications of amino acids in the attachment G glycoprotein. In 1999, the BA genotype with a 60-nt insertion in G (generating a 20-aa insertion in the C-terminal region) in an RSV-B strain was detected in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

 </sup> The BA variant subsequently spread slowly and sequentially throughout the world,

 </sup> becoming the predominant group B genotype, and in some regions replaced all previous circulating RSV-B genotypes with a divergent BA lineage.

 </sup> More recently, the RSV-A genotype ON1, which had a larger insertion than BA, was first identified in specimens collected at the end of 2010 in Ontario, Canada. In the ensuing years, the ON1 genotype has been found in Malaysia,

 </sup> which indicates that it spread rapidly and diversified globally. However, in China, there are no detailed reports about the population of the ON1 genotype, particularly in northwestern China. However, it is not known whether this new genotype could be more pathogenic, which is the information that would be of high interest to researchers worldwide. Research on the ON1 genotype has developed gradually. Investigation on the spread of ON1 is important to understand to which extent genetic variability can modify the epidemic behavior of RSV at the population level.
