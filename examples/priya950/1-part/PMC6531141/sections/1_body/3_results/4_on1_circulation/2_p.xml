<p>We found that 2 RSV-A genotypes were circulating in Lanzhou during 2010 to 2017, ON1 (n = 136, 30.3%) and NA1 (n = 313, 69.7%). The temporal prevalence of RSV-A, and genotypes ON1 and non-ON1, is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. ON1 was first detected in Lanzhou in the 2012/2013 season (August 2012). The prevalence of ON1 in Lanzhou was 0% in the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012, 25% in 2012/2013 when ON1 was first detected in Lanzhou, 85.7% in 2013/2014 and 95.7% in 2014/2015 epidemics, respectively, and finally 100% in the recent 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 epidemics, that is, we observed rapid replacement of the previously circulating dominant non-ON1 genotypes by ON1, and 2 years after its first being detected abroad in 2010/2011 (November 2010) and prevalence in 2012/2013 in Canada. In addition, RSV-A predominated in 4 nonconsecutive RSV epidemics in 2010/2011, 2011/2012, 2014/2015, and 2015/2016.
