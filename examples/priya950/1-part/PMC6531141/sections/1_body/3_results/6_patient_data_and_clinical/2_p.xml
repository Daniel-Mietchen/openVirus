<p>In our study, we analyzed demographic and clinical data from 468 RSV-A cases and found differences between infections with ON1 versus non-ON1 strains. ON1 patients were more likely to be younger males receiving inpatient treatment (
 <italic>P</italic> = .044), similar to data record in an Italian report for 2011 to 2013. Infections were more severe than those caused by non-ON1 strains. ON1 infection is more commonly diagnosed with bronchiolitis and wheezing is a more common symptoms. However, for the ON1 patients, the PICU occupancy rate is not high (not statistically different from non-ON1) (
 <italic>P</italic> = .4), which is different from Italy and German Studies. In addition, ON1 patients spend more days in the hospital (
 <italic>P</italic> = .002).
