<p>From December 2010 to June 2017 (7 RSV epidemics), 2430 samples were collected from eligible children (average age: 5.1 months; median age: 2.95 months; range: 1â€“36 months). For the samples, 2175 (89.5%) were tested for RSV, 584 (26.9%) were RSV-positive and 449 (78.2%) were RSV-A-positive. The G gene was successfully sequenced in 574 (98.3%) samples. All patients were hospitalized and clinical serviced for respiratory conditions. As summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, 177 cases were from 2010/2011, 149 from 2011/2012, 16 from 2012/2013, 7 from 2013/2014, 70 from 2014/2015, 45 from 2015/2016, and 4 cases from 2016/2017. Among the 449 RSV-A positive samples, all were successfully sequenced and categorized based on the presence of a 72-nt insert in the G gene (Table
