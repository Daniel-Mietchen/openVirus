<p>According to the evolutionary tree, in Lanzhou and between 2010 and 2017, there are 2 epidemic RSV-A genomes in Lanzhou, that is, NA1 and ON1 genotypes. Among the 449 RSV-A isolates, 44 different G genomes exist, and combining reference sequences, genetic evolutionary tree was drawn. The bacteria strains NA1 and ON1 were both derived from GA2 genome, and more specifically, ON1 came from NA1 genotype. ON1 is characterized by a 72-nt insertion in G, resulting in 24 extra amino acids of which 23 are duplications of 261 to 283.</p>
