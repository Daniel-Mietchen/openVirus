<p>In addition to the epidemiological impact, significant genetic variation in circulating strains may involve different pathogenicity and virulence. A study from Kilif showed a change in the alternation of RSV subgroup dominance patterns because ON1 was introduced into this community. Previously, RSV-A predominated in up to 2 consecutive epidemics in Kilifi, whereas it predominated over RSV-B in 3 consecutive epidemics from 2012/2013 to 2014/2015. However, we did not find this phenomenon in our study. The first ON1 strain was found in Lanzhou in 2012 and in following years, RSV-A and B subtypes are still prevalent every 2 years. A study in Italy reported that the beginning and peak times of RSV were earlier than before because of the emergence of the ON1 genotype, and the phenomenon was also been found in our research.</p>
