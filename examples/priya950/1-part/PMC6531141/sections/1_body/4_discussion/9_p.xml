<p>The possibility exists that ON1 and other similar new RSV variants (e.g., the BA genotype) gain dominance by evading host immunity. The appearance of ON1 makes RSV-A “reset to zero,” which provides a new possibility for further development of an RSV vaccine. ON1 may be similar to the BA genotype and be the predominant strain of RSV-A for decades. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the appearance of ON1 could lead to evasion of future vaccine-induced protection, lessening the herd immunity potential of vaccination, yet to provide a new possibility for manufacture of an RSV vaccine. Because of the emergence of ON1, RSV-A “reset to zero” and human immunity set to zero, the vaccine development can also been seen as zero to some extent. In conclusion, the emergence of ON1 is a challenge and an opportunity for the development of an RSV vaccine, and has important public health significance. Continued surveillance for cases and collection of detailed standardized clinical data are warranted.</p>
