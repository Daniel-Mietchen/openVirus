<p>High homology among wild-type NA1 and ON1 genotypes in Lanzhou and isolates from GenBank reveals the global distribution of these 2 genotypes. Site-specific evolutionary analysis of the C-terminal hypervariable region of the G protein among Ontario NA1 isolates revealed strong evolutionary selection pressure, resulting in 19 positively selected sites compared with the NA1 reference genotype. For ON1 genotype, the substitutions at amino acids 274 and 290 resulted in loss of group- and strain-specific epitopes.

 </sup> The variability and apparent evolution seen at the positively selected site 274 in the ON1 cluster of sequences is particularly interesting. The aa 237 mutation, presenting in 56% of the Ontario NA1 isolates, suggested the gain of a potential N-glycosylation site. These reverted mutations, particularly in the epitope regions, may decrease the antigen avidity to the current circulating strain-specific antibodies. The longer attachment protein of the 72-nt duplication in ON1 viruses seems to offer more opportunities for variable changes and thus greater diversity and increased fitness over previous group A genotypes. Notably, new N-glycosylation sites were discovered in our study, 2 in 23aa in 2015/2016 epidemic season and 1 in 24-aa duplication area in 2016/2017. Overall, a variety of genetic changes could be responsible for the spread of ON1 strains, conferring low cross-protection by preexisting antibodies against RSV-A strains previously circulating in Italy: the 24aa insertion, the loss of a further potential glycosylation site due to the T253K substitution, and even other amino acid changes.
