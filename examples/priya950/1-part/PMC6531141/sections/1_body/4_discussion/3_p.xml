<p>We documented circulation of 2 genotypes of NA1 (98.6% of RSV-A isolates detected from 2010 to 2013) and ON1 (97.1% of RSV-A isolates detected from 20132017) in Lanzhou. In addition, ON1 is a novel genotype, characterized by a 72-nt duplication in the C-terminal region of the G gene, first reported in Canada. All RSV-A G-gene variants described in this report are derived from the GA2 genotype and are genetically close to the recently characterized NA1 genotype, which are the most recent strains circulating worldwide.

 </sup> Our findings document the presence of the novel ON1 genotype in Northwestern China in the 2012/2013 epidemic season (August 2012) and its rapid spread in 2013/2014, which is 2 years later than its prevalence in some of the foreign countries (e.g., Italy). We provide a detailed analysis on the spread and the associated demographic, clinical, and evolutionary characteristics of the novel RSV-A genotype ON1 in Lanzhou.
