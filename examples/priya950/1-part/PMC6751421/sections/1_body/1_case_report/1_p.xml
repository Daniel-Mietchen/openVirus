<p>A 79-year-old housewife presented to our hospital with exertional dyspnoea, gradually increasing shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitation, and decreased urine output over the last 4–5 days, with severe exacerbation of dyspnoea and watery diarrhoea for the last 2 days. She denied any history of diabetes, hypertension, any pre-existing liver disease, abdominal discomfort, or passage of blood or mucus in stool. She was known to have intermittent shortness of breath especially in the winter season, but she admitted that she was very irregular in taking inhaled bronchodilators prescribed by her physician. She had never required hospital admission for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This time there was no history of fever, cough with expectoration, jaundice, pruritus, melena, haemoptysis, or altered sensorium. On inquiry she admitted that for the last 10–15 days she had not been feeling well, feeling feverish, having malaise, being fatigued and having lost her usual appetite. She did not have any skin rash or arthralgia. Clinical observation at the emergency room revealed that she was orthopneic, conscious, and oriented. She was anaemic and there was mild icterus, but she was not cyanotic, and no clubbing was noticed. There was mild pitting oedema at her feet. On admission her blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, heart rate was 104/min, respiratory rate was 24/min, temperature was 98°F, oxygen saturation breathing room air was 91%, and capillary blood glucose was 121 mg/dL. Her abdomen was soft with mild tenderness at the right hypochondrium. There were no organomegaly nor palpable mass or lymph nodes. There was no focal neurodeficit. Cardiac auscultation revealed S3 gallop. The respiratory system revealed bi-basal crepitations in both lung fields with bilateral diffuse rhonchi. She was advised immediate admission from the emergency room.</p>
