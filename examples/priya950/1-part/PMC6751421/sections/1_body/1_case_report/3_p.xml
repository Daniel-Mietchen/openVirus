<p>Over a period of 2 days, the patient gradually improved and was weaned off non-invasive ventilation support. Her biochemical parameters indicated an improvement of liver function. The antibiotic was stepped down gradually with improvement in renal function. With adequate nutritional therapy, diuretics, and other conservative management, she started showing positive improvements in her clinical parameters. Serum creatinine came down to 1.9 mg/dL, she started passing adequate urine of around 2 L/day, maintained an oxygen saturation breathing room air of 98%, and there was no dyspnoea. All her liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase 119 U/L, alanine transaminase 307 U/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase 79 U/L) settled down in 7 days. Persistently her urine output improved and tachycardia subsided. A repeat 2D echocardiogram after 14 days showed improvement in cardiac contractility with an ejection fraction of 50% (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The blood investigation results on admission and at discharge are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. As she rapidly improved over the next few days and subsequent cardiac evaluation was normal by day 14, she was screed only by echocardiography. She was discharged on day 16 of the hospital stay.
