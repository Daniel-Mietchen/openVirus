<p>The concomitant acute viral hepatitis E and acute myocarditis in this case and the subsequent resolution of cardiac symptoms with a resolution of acute hepatitis indicated an aetiological link between hepatitis and myocarditis. We feel that it is pertinent to report that benign self-limiting acute hepatitis E can sometimes be complicated by life-threatening acute myocarditis leading to decompensated heart failure. In spite of the fact that there were repeated outbreaks of viral hepatitis E in West Bengal, there had to date been no reported case of HEV-induced acute myocarditis. To our knowledge, this is so far the first ever reported case from West Bengal, and we feel that hepatitis E should also be kept in mind as a possible viral aetiology of acute myocarditis, irrespective of age.</p>
