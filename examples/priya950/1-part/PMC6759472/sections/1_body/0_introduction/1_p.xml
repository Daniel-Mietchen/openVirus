<p>Neurotropic viral infection can directly and indirectly (e.g., by inducing local immune responses) disrupt the complex structural and functional architecture of the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, several neurological disorders are often associated with autoimmune mechanisms initiated by a viral infection, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">van den Berg et al., 2014</xref>). Neurotropic viruses invade the CNS by various routes, including retrograde axonal transport from infected motor and olfactory neurons, infected immune cells that cross the brain endothelium, or by direct infection of cells at the blood–brain barrier (BBB), blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and the meningeal-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Ludlow et al., 2016</xref>). BBB dysfunction appears to be the main route for viral neuroinvasion, and it is preceded by changes in the expression of cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Suen et al., 2014</xref>) infections. Part of this effect is related to high susceptibility of vascular endothelial cells to oxidative and proinflammatory insult (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Toborek et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), combined with efficient intercellular communication (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). HCV and WNV, together with several other major human pathogens, including Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus, and Zika virus (ZIKV), are members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family of viruses. These viruses have significant neuroinvasive characteristics and are regarded as neurotropic (
