<p>Zika virus is an enveloped, mosquito-borne flavivirus, containing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Yun and Lee, 2017</xref>). Two main lineages, named African and Asian, have been identified so far from the entire genome sequencing data. The African lineage is composed of clusters from Uganda and Nigeria, and the majority of strains were isolated from enzootic vectors, whereas the Asian lineage has been associated with the majority of the human epidemics (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Miner and Diamond, 2017</xref>). ZIKV infects endothelial cells derived from the aorta, brain, and lymphatic and umbilical vessels (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Richard et al., 2017</xref>). In brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC), ZIKV infection persists, despite innate antiviral responses, functioning as a viral reservoir capable of spreading the infection into neuronal compartments (
