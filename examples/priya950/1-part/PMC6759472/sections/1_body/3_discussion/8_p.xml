<p>After the recent Zika epidemic, the development of animal models to study the virus pathogenesis has been a research priority. There are approximately 20 mouse models of ZIKV infection published in the literature (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Morrison and Diamond, 2017</xref>); however, only a few studies were successful in using immunocompetent adult mice (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Larocca et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Yockey et al., 2016</xref>). Among these studies, ZIKV was detected in blood (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Larocca et al., 2016</xref>), testes (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2016</xref>), and vaginal tissues (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Yockey et al., 2016</xref>), correlating with the inoculation route (intravenous, intratesticular, and intravaginal, respectively). To our knowledge, our study is the first to show an immunocompetent adult mouse model of systemic and brain infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Our model could serve as a stepping stone for the development of more robust animal models associated with ZIKV pathogenesis in adults, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Morrison and Diamond, 2017</xref>). It is well-established that ZIKV infects neural progenitor cells, mature neurons, astrocytes, and brain endothelial cells in the CNS. In addition, it has been recently reported that ZIKV infection of microglia cells leads to modulation of the expression of numerous metabolites, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, ceramide and sphingomyelin, and carboxylic acids. Some of these metabolites are involved in neuronal differentiation, regulation of apoptosis, virion architecture, and viral replication. In the same study, ZIKV infection was associated with concomitant secretion of inflammatory mediators linked to CNS inflammation and alterations in endothelial and microvascular permeability, such as IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, and NO. Furthermore, ZIKV infection resulted in upregulation of the expression of the gene encoding for CX3CR1, a chemokine receptor known to regulate functional synapse plasticity and signaling between microglial cells (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Diop et al., 2018</xref>). Upregulation of these proinflammatory mediators is important because inflammatory Th1 cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and CCL-2 play important roles in increasing endothelial/microvascular permeability, both

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Fahey and Doyle, 2019</xref>). IFN-γ, on the other hand, tends to stabilize TJs (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Capaldo and Nusrat, 2009</xref>). Consistent with these results, our analyses performed on microvessels isolated from ZIKV-infected brains also revealed upregulation of genes involved in immune responses against viral infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, we observed downregulation of selected genes related to neurogenesis and cell differentiation, namely, Omp and Plekhb1. Intriguing further studies are needed to determine if these gene alterations might influence the development of neuronal division and growth, leading to microcephaly in offspring. While the gene expression changes observed in the present study were independent of the infection by individual ZIKV strains, detailed genetic studies of different strains may reveal viral genetic determinants affecting ZIKV-mediated input on TJ and BBB functionality as well as on CNS neuroinvasion.
