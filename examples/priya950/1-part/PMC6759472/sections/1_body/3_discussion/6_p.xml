<p>Interestingly, when we evaluated the expression of TJ proteins after ZIKV infection, significant changes starting at 2 dpi, and at a physiologically relevant dose (MOI 0.01) were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Expression of claudin-5 and occludin were significantly downregulated in ZIKV-PR and ZIKV-U infected BMECs, whereas ZO-1 expression was upregulated. Changes in TJ protein expression are frequently accompanied by disruption of endothelial integrity, as demonstrated for other neurotropic flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Velandia-Romero et al., 2016</xref>). However, the role of occludin in maintaining barrier function is not clearly defined as occludin-deficient mice form paracellular barriers and do not exhibit defects in epidermal, respiratory, or bladder TJ functions (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Schulzke et al., 2005</xref>). While downregulation of claudin-5 has been very strongly associated with an increase in transendothelial permeability (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Andras et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Argaw et al., 2009</xref>), it is possible that upregulation of ZO-1 can maintain functional barrier properties by affecting other claudins or other transmembrane TJ proteins.
