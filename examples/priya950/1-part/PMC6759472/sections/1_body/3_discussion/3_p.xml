<p>Our data show that ZIKV infects and replicates in BMECs, the main component of the BBB, independent of viral strain. Moreover, we found no differences in infection and replication efficiency among different strains in these cells, as shown by ZIKV RNA quantification from both cell culture supernatants and cell lysates (
