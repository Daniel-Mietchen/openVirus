<p>The viral strains responsible for the recent outbreaks in the Americas, leading to an alarmingly high number of cases of microcephaly, were phylogenetically clustered to Asian strains of ZIKV, previously associated with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and microcephaly (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lessler et al., 2016</xref>). In Asia, on the other hand, the outbreaks emerged during the 2000 decade, as a consequent spread of the ZIKV burden from Africa (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Duffy et al., 2009</xref>). African strains of ZIKV have not been associated with human neuropathogenesis and the disease remains predominantly in the sylvatic cycle (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lessler et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the impact of three different strains of ZIKV in BBB integrity: the Honduras and Puerto Rico strains, representing the Asian lineage; and the Uganda strain representing the African lineage.
