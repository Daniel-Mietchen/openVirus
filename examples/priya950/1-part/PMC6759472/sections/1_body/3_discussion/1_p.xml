<p>The present study aimed to identify the mechanisms by which ZIKV crosses the BBB to infect CNS cells, a condition that has been linked to microcephaly in infants and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome in adults. Here we used an animal model of ZIKV infection of immunocompetent adult mice to verify possible damages in BBB integrity in the adult population. We chose to analyze different strains of ZIKV in order to verify possible differences in neurovirulence, and therefore in neuropathogenesis.</p>
