<p>Results presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> indicated that 11/24 (45.8%) mice subjected to ZIKV infection developed brain infection and/or disruption of the BBB. Because ZIKV may infect the brain as the result of penetration via the BBB, we attempted to analyze if these changes are associated. Indeed, alterations of BBB permeability were detected in all mice that developed brain infection with ZIKV-H (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). However, ZIKV-PR and ZIKV-U-infected mice presented a less evident association, suggesting strain-specific effects for ZIKV-H infection.
