<p>Our next series of experiments focused on the impact of ZIKV infection on BBB permeability as assessed by the NaF extravasation assay. The same animals that were used to evaluate ZIKV-induced brain infection in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> were injected intraperitoneally with 10% NaF, the dye was allowed to circulate for 20 min, and NaF extravasation into the brain parenchyma was measured as previously established in our laboratory (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Infection with ZIKV-H induced significant increase in the mean levels of NaF fluorescence in the brain, compared to mock-infected controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). While the mean levels of NaF fluorescence in the brains of ZIKV-PR and ZIKV-U-infected animals were approximately 2-fold higher compared to mock-infected controls, no statistical significance was detected due to high in-group variability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).
