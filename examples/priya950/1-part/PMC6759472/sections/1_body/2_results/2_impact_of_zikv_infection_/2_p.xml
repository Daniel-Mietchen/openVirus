<p>Intriguingly, ZIKV infection caused alterations of the levels of TJ proteins. Cells were infected with ZIKV-H, ZIKV-PR, ZIKV-U, or mock-infected (media only) at MOI 0.01 and lysed in RIPA buffer at 2, 4, and 6 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The expression levels of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5, three major TJ proteins involved in maintaining endothelial permeability, were analyzed by immunoblotting. A significant reduction in claudin-5 levels was observed in cells infected with ZIKV-PR and ZIKV-U throughout the infection time points analyzed. In addition, a significant downregulation of claudin-5 in ZIKV-H-infected cells compared to mock-infected controls was observed at 4 dpi and sustained at 6 dpi. On the other hand, ZIKV-H-infected cells presented significantly increased expression of ZO-1 at 2, 4, and 6 dpi. Interestingly, at 2 dpi, expression of ZO-1 and occludin was significantly decreased in ZIKV-PR and ZIKV-U-infected cells, compared to mock-infected controls. Downregulation of occludin persisted at 4 and 6 dpi in ZIKV-PR-infected cells (
