<p>To evaluate the impact of ZIKV infection on endothelial permeability, human primary BMECs were grown to confluence on transwell inserts. Preliminary permeability experiments (data not shown) were performed with BMECs infected with ZIKV-H at MOI 0.01 and 1; however, no alteration of BMEC barrier integrity was detected; therefore, the subsequent experiments were performed at MOI 10 to ensure that all cultured cells were infected. Control cultures were exposed to medium only. Then, media in the apical compartment of the transwell system was replaced with medium containing fluorescently tagged dextran of either 20 kDa or 10 kDa (

Infection with all ZIKV strains employed in the current study did not induce significant differences in endothelial permeability.
