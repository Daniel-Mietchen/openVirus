<p>Productive infection was also assessed by expression of viral proteins. ZIKV-infected BMEC lysates were submitted to immunoblotting for NS-1 ZIKV protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). NS-1 was detected as early as 1 (data not shown) and 2 dpi in ZIKV-U-infected BMEC. At 4 and 6 dpi, NS-1 expression was observed in ZIKV-PR and ZIKV-U-infected cells; however, no NS-1 protein was detected in ZIKV-H-infected cells (

In these experiments, BMECs were seeded on 8-well chamber slides, infected at 80% confluency and MOI 0.01, and stained for ZIKV NS1 protein (red) and DAPI (blue) at 2 dpi (
