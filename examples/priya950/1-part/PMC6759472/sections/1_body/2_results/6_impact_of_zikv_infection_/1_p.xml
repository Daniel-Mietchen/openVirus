<p>Our studies on the impact of ZIKV infection on brain microvasculature and the BBB were completed by evaluating the transcriptome profile of brain microvessels by high-throughput RNA sequencing. Eight animals (4 males and 4 females) per group were infected with ZIKV-H, ZIKV-PR, and ZIKV-U for 48 h. Mock-infected animals were included as negative controls. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, ZIKV titers in the brain show biphasic response, with the first peak at 2 dpi, followed by the second peak at 7 dpi. Protein expression profiles and the transcriptome analysis were performed during the first peak, i.e., at 2 dpi. Whole brain tissue samples were homogenized and microvessels were isolated and submitted to RNA extraction, followed by sequencing, as described in section “Materials and Methods”.
