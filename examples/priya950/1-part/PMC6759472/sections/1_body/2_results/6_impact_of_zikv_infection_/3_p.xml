<p>The transcriptome of brain microvessels (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) from animals infected with ZIKV-H, ZIKV-PR, and ZIKV-U was quite uniform, except for the Xist gene that was downregulated in male animals, compared to females (
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.4 × 10
 <sup>–26</sup>). The Xist gene ensures X-chromosome inactivation in female placental mammals, and therefore its expression is expected to be low in male animals. Gene expression related to BBB function was not significantly changed in microvessels isolated from ZIKV-infected animals as compared to mock-infected controls. However, the analysis revealed upregulation of genes involved in immune responses against viral infection, such as Ddx60 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.2 × 10
 <sup>–24</sup>), Dhx58 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 8.8 × 10
 <sup>–45</sup>) and Nlrc5 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 5.4 × 10
 <sup>–45</sup>). In addition, IFN-related immune response genes, such as Zbp1 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 6.8 × 10
 <sup>–44</sup>) and genes of the Oas (Oasl2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 8.1 × 10
 <sup>–72</sup>; Oas1b, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 5.9 × 10
 <sup>–59</sup>; Oas3, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 5.3 × 10
 <sup>–13</sup>; Oas1g, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.0 × 10
 <sup>–34</sup>; OasL1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.7 × 10
 <sup>–25</sup>; Oas2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.0 × 10
 <sup>–59</sup>; Oas1a, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 9.3 × 10
 <sup>–38</sup>), H2-Q (H2-Q4, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.5 × 10
 <sup>–53</sup>; H2-Q5, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 4.1 × 10
 <sup>–30</sup>; H2-Q6, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 5.2 × 10
 <sup>–55</sup>; H2-Q7, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.6 × 10
 <sup>–54</sup>), Irf (Irf7, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 9.8 × 10
 <sup>–86</sup>; Irf9, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.0 × 10
 <sup>–33</sup>), and Stat (Stat1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.1 × 10
 <sup>–46</sup>; Stat2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 5.9 × 10
 <sup>–75</sup>) families were upregulated in microvessels of ZIKV-infected animals. Interestingly, the gene Rnf213 was significantly upregulated in ZIKV-infected animals (
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.9 × 10
 <sup>–46</sup>). Rnf213 encodes a type Zn-finger protein involved in mediating protein-protein interactions and has been reported as a susceptibility gene for Moyamoya disease, a vascular disorder of intracranial arteries (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, expression of the gene encoding the cellular glycoprotein galectin 3 binding protein (Lgals3bp) was significantly upregulated in ZIKV-infected animals, compared to mock-infected animals (
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.0 × 10
 <sup>–28</sup>). The expression of Lgals3bp is upregulated in the context of HIV-1 and HCV infections, and its expression is associated with upregulation of IL-2, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and TNF-α, contributing to an antiviral state (
