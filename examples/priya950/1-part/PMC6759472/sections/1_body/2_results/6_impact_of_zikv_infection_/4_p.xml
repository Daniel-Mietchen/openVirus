<p>Regarding the mostly downregulated genes, ribosomal protein encoding genes were significantly downregulated in ZIKV-infected animals, compared to mock-infected animals (Rpl3, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 4.1 × 10
 <sup>–19</sup>; Rpl19, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.7 × 10
 <sup>–12</sup>; Rpl27a, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.7 × 10

 <sup>–7</sup>; Rps28, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.1 × 10
 <sup>–20</sup>). Interestingly, one gene related to neurogenesis signaling pathway and one gene related to cell differentiation signaling pathway (Omp and Plekhb1, respectively) were significantly downregulated in ZIKV-infected animals, as compared to mock-infected animals (

 <sup>–23</sup>, respectively).
