<p>Using the microvessels isolated from the brains of mice analyzed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, we evaluated the levels of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 by immunoblotting. Mice were grouped according to the detection of ZIKV RNA in their brain, and the analyses were performed separately on infected and mock-infected brains at 2 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Animals infected with ZIKV-H exhibited a trend toward increased levels of TJ proteins in both infected and mock-infected brains as compared to mock-infected controls. ZIKV-PR-infected mice presented a trend toward decreased TJ protein levels in the infected brains, but not in the mock-infected brains. A similar trend in decreased TJ protein expression was observed in ZIKV-U infected brains, with claudin-5 expression reaching statistically significant values (
