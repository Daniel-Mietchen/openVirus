<p>Following the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses, we next evaluated the impact of ZIKV infection on BBB permeability and TJ protein expression 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In order to assess the kinetics of ZIKV infection, immunocompetent C57BL/6J male mice were infected with 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU of ZIKV-PR or vehicle and euthanized at 1 dpi (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4), 2 dpi (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4), 4 dpi (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4), 6 dpi (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4), and 8 dpi (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4). Systemic infection was verified by the presence of ZIKV RNA in spleen tissue homogenates and plasma samples by ZIKV-specific RT-qPCR. In brain tissue homogenates, ZIKV RNA levels peaked at 2 dpi (
