<p>A total of 8 animals (4 males and 4 females) per group (groups: ZIKV-H, ZIKV-PR, ZIKV-U, vehicle) were infected intravenously with 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU of ZIKV and euthanized at 2 dpi. Plasma, spleen and brain tissues were collected and processed for RNA extraction, followed by ZIKV detection by RT-qPCR. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> depicts the RNA quantification for each tissue analyzed and for individual ZIKV strains. No differences were observed between male and female genders. Therefore, the results from male and female mice were combined.
