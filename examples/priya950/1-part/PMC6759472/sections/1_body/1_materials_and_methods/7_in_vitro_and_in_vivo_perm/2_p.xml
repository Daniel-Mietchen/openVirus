 <italic>In vivo</italic> BBB permeability assays were performed using sodium fluorescein (NaF) as described before (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Briefly, 20 min before euthanasia mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μL of 10% sodium fluorescein. Blood was collected via heart puncture, and the mice were transcardially perfused with saline to remove blood from the intravascular compartment. Brains were harvested and thoroughly homogenized in PBS, containing freshly added protease inhibitors, and cleared of debris by centrifugation (1,250 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, 5 min, at 4°C). Proteins were precipitated with 100% trichloroacetic acid (TCA; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4°C. After the incubation period, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, 15 min, at 4°C and supernatants were harvested and mixed with 0.05 M sodium tetraborate buffer. A NaF standard curve was prepared by serially diluting 0.01% NaF in saline at a 1:2 ratio, and a total of 12 NaF concentrations were used. NaF fluorescence was measured in a fluorescent plate reader (Ex: 485 nm; Em: 525 nm). Protein levels were measured by the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit for normalization of NaF fluorescence.
