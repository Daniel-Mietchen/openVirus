<p>Protein fractions from cell culture lysates and isolated brain microvessels were extracted with RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and 1% Triton X-100 to inactivate ZIKV. Protein concentrations were measured by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The proteins (20 μg/well) were loaded on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide 4–20% ready gels (BioRad) and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a transfer pack system (BioRad). The blots were probed overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-ZIKV NS-1 (GeneTex; #GTX133307), rabbit anti-Claudin-5 (Abcam; #ab15106), rabbit anti-ZO-1 (Abcam; #ab96587), and rabbit anti-Occludin (Abcam; #ab167161) (1:1,000) in 5% BSA in TBS-T, overnight at 4°C. Then, the samples were incubated with conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Licor) (1:20,000) in 5% BSA in TBS-T, for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed three times in TBS-T for 5 min after each incubation step. Membranes were imaged in the Licor CLX imaging system and signal quantification was performed using ImageStudio 4.0 software. The GAPDH housekeeping gene was used as a reference.</p>
