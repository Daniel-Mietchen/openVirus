<p>Total RNA was isolated from 200 μL of plasma or cell culture supernatant using MinElute Virus Spin kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was also isolated from 400 μL of tissue homogenates (spleen and half brain) or 100 μL of cell culture lysates, using RNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). RT-qPCR of plasma and tissue total RNA samples was performed using primers specific for all ZIKV strains evaluated in the present study (5′-CCG CTG CCC AAC ACA AG-3′ and 5′-CCA CTA ACG TTC TTT TGC AGA CAT-3′), probe (5′-6FAM-AGC CTA CCT TGA CAA GCA GTC AGA CAC TCA A-IABkFQ-3′) (Integrated DNA Technologies), and the qScript XLT 1-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix (Quantabio) reaction mix in a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA absolute quantification per cell was achieved by fitting to serially diluted standard curves of plasmids containing the target region of ZIKV (10
 <sup>8</sup> to 10
 <sup>1</sup> viral copies) and the mouse housekeeping gene hemoglobin beta chain complex (HBB) (10
 <sup>8</sup> to 10
 <sup>1</sup> gene copies), as previously described by our group (

 <sup>1</sup> were considered undetectable and were plotted as zero in the graphs.
