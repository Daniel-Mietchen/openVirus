  <p>ZIKV infection kinetics in immunocompetent mice. C57BL/6J mice were infected intravenously with 10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU of ZIKV-PR or vehicle and euthanized at 1 dpi (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4), 2 dpi (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4), 4 dpi (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4), 6 dpi (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4), and 8 dpi (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4). ZIKV RNA quantification was assessed in plasma (in red; expressed as RNA copies/mL of blood), spleen (in blue; expressed as RNA copies/10
   <sup>6</sup> cells) and brain homogenates (in black; expressed as RNA copies/10
   <sup>6</sup> cells) by qPCR. Data are mean Â± SEM.
