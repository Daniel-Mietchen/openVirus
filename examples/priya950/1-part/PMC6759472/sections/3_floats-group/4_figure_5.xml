  <p>Impact of ZIKV infection in BBB permeability 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>. C57BL/6J mice were infected intravenously with 10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU of ZIKV-H, ZIKV-PR, and ZIKV-U, and euthanized after 48 h. Mock-infected controls were injected intravenously with PBS. Approximately 20 min before euthanasia, animals were treated intraperitoneally with 10% sodium fluorescein (NaF, 376 Da). Translocation of NaF from plasma into the brain parenchyma was used as the indicator of BBB integrity. Closed symbols indicate animals with ZIKV-infected brains; open symbols indicate animals with no brain infection. Data are mean ± SEM, expressed as fold change compared to mock-infected control, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 8 per group. 
   <sup>∗</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.0078, vs. mock-infected control.
