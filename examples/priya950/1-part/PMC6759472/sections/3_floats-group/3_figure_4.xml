  <p>Different strains of ZIKV infect immunocompetent mice. C57BL/6J mice were infected intravenously with 10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU of ZIKV-H, ZIKV-PR, and ZIKV-U, and euthanized after 48 h. Mock-infected controls were injected intravenously with PBS. ZIKV RNA quantification was assessed in plasma (
   <bold>A</bold>; expressed as RNA copies/mL of blood), spleen (
   <bold>B</bold>; expressed as RNA copies/10
   <sup>6</sup> cells) and brain homogenates (
   <bold>C</bold>; expressed as RNA copies/10
   <sup>6</sup> cells) by qPCR. Viral copy numbers less than 10
   <sup>1</sup> were considered undetectable and were plotted as equal to zero. ZIKV RNA was detected for all animals in plasma and spleen homogenates (
   <italic>n</italic> = 8 per group). Brain homogenates were positive for ZIKV RNA in 3/8, 3/8, and 5/8 animals infected with ZIKV-H, ZIKV-PR, and ZIKV-U, respectively. Data are mean Â± SEM.
