  <p>Different strains of ZIKV productively infect brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Primary human BMECs were infected with different strains of ZIKV: Honduras (ZIKV-H), Puerto Rico (ZIKV-PR), and Uganda (ZIKV-U) at MOI 0.01 for 2, 4, and 6 days. Mock-infected controls (Mock) were treated with virus-free media. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> ZIKV quantification by RT-qPCR, expressed as ZIKV RNA copies per mL in cell culture supernatant (left graph) and cell culture lysates (right graph). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Detection of ZIKV NS-1 protein expression by immunoblotting in BMEC culture lysates. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Confocal images of ZIKV-infected BMECs stained for ZIKV NS-1 protein (red; arrows). Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue). Images are representative of three individual experiments (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Representative image of the plaque assay in Vero cells inoculated with BMEC culture supernatant at 2 dpi, showing infectivity of viral particles produced by infected BMECs. Dpi: days post-infection.
