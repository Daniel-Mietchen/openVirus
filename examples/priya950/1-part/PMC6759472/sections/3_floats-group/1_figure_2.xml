  <p>ZIKV infection impact on endothelial cell permeability and tight junction protein expression. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Using a transwell system, primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were infected with different strains of ZIKV: Honduras (ZIKV-H), Puerto Rico (ZIKV-PR), and Uganda (ZIKV-U) at MOI 10. Mock-infected controls (Mock) were treated with virus-free media. At 2 dpi, culture media in the apical compartment of the transwell system was replaced with medium containing fluorescently tagged dextran (FD) of 20 kDa (upper panel) and 10 kDa (lower panel). Basolateral levels of FD were assayed 90 min post-addition of FD-dextran. Data are mean ± SEM, expressed as fold increase over mock-infected control; three independent experiments, each with

   <bold>(B)</bold> Expression of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 was assessed by immunoblotting at 2, 4, and 6 dpi in primary human BMECs infected with ZIKV-H (blue), ZIKV-PR (red), and ZIKV-U (green) at MOI 0.01. Mock-infected controls (Mock; black) were treated with virus-free media. Presented blots are cropped from the originals. Data are mean ± SEM expressed as fold increase over mock-infected control.
