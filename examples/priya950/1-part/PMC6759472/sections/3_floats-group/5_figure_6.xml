  <p>ZIKV infection impact on tight junction proteins expression

   <bold>(A)</bold>, ZIKV-PR 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, and ZIKV-U 
   <bold>(C)</bold> infected animals. ZIKV-infected animals were divided according to viral detection in the brain, according to RT-qPCR data (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) (Brain negative: ZIKV-infected mice with brain RT-qPCR negative; Brain positive: ZIKV-infected mice with brain RT-qPCR positive). GAPDH was used as an internal control. Presented blots are cropped from the originals. Data are mean ± SEM expressed as fold increase over mock-infected control.
