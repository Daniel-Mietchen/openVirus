<p>As part of this development pathway, a transgenic strain of 
 <italic>A. gambiae</italic> that confers sexual sterility to males has been developed (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>). The effector protein, a fusion of 
 <italic>I-PpoI</italic> DNA nuclease and enhanced green fluorescent protein (
 <italic>eGFP</italic>), cleaves a 15 bp target site in the 28S ribosomal DNA which consists of hundreds of copies and, in this species, is typically located exclusively on the X chromosome (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al. 1987</xref>). The resulting sexual sterility is a trait expressed only in males because the nuclease is controlled by a testes-specific promoter. A sufficient amount of the fusion protein is transported by all sperm produced in transgenic males to cleave the rDNA of the pronucleus so that embryos fail to develop (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>). As a consequence of complete male sexual sterility, the transgene must be maintained in mosquitoes by backcrossing transgenic females to nontransgenic males. This has been done using males of a ‘wild-type’ laboratory strain, in this case one named ‘G3’ (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. 2012</xref>). This process of repeated backcrossing and recombination in both sexes results in progeny in which populations consist of nontransgenic or heterozygous transgenic individuals. Individuals that carry the transgene are genetically distinguishable from those that do not only by the transgene and the immediate vicinity of the chromosome that might not have undergone recombination during the backcrossing process. These nontransgenic individuals provide a useful experimental comparator to test effects specifically due to the transgene in nearly identical genetic backgrounds.
