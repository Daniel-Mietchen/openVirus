<p>No significant differences were found among mean body viral titers; however, there were significant differences in leg titers between the 4.1 Log
 <sub>10</sub> dose of the TR mosquito strain and the 5.6 Log
 <sub>10</sub> dose treatment in the WT strains strain and between the 5.6 Log
 <sub>10</sub> highest dose treatment of the TR and WT strains (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Note that the number of individuals that were positive for CPE is greater than the number of individuals from which a plaque titer was obtained because of the higher sensitivity of the CPE screening assay. The high-dose WT leg sample had a particularly low proportion of individuals in which the virus titer could be detected, which may have affected the statistical interpretation. Two saliva samples were positive by CPE assay in the TR mosquito group at the highest dose (5.6 Log
 <sub>10</sub>) but the titer was below the detection limit for the plaque assay. All saliva samples were negative by CPE in WT mosquito groups.
