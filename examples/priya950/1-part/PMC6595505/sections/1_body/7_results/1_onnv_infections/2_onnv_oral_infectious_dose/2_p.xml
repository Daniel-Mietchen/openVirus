<p>The same measures were made at day 14 PI (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For the 14 d PI bodies, the oral ID
 <sub>50</sub> for the TR and WT were Log
 <sub>10</sub> = 3.12 and Log
 <sub>10</sub> = 3.46, respectively. Two saliva samples were positive by CPE assay in the TR mosquito group at the highest dose (5.6 Log
 <sub>10</sub>). All saliva samples were negative in WT mosquito groups. Overall, our infection and dissemination results showing limited vector competence were similar to those reported previously (
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Brault et al. 2004</xref>) with this ONNV strain in 
 <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, and there was no significant difference in infection rate between TR and WT groups at any dose.
