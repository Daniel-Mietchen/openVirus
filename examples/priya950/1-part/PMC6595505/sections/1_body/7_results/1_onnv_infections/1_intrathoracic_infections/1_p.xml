<p>To examine potential differences in ONNV replication within the two mosquito strains, cohorts of both mosquito strains were inoculated intrathoracically. The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. No significant difference in the number of females that became infected was observed at any dose between the transgenic and wild-type populations. Fisherâ€™s exact test probabilities for the four doses tested (0, 1, 2.5, 3.5 back titer dose (Log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/ml) were 0.50, 0.39, 0.38, and 0.07, respectively).
