<p>With regard to prevalence of infection, the three SMFAs each gave different relative results. In blood-feeding number 1, the prevalence was not significantly different between the two groups. In one of the other two (number 2), the WT group had higher prevalence and in number 3, the WT prevalence was lower. Mirroring these results, there was no significant difference in oocyst intensity in blood-feeding number 1 between TR and WT (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.665), while there were significant differences in feeding 2 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002, WT &gt; TR) and feeding 3 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007, WT &lt; TR). When all three feeding results were analyzed together, there was no significant difference in oocyst intensity: the best estimate of oocyst intensity ratio (oocyst intensity in TR over that in WT) = 0.95 (95% CI, 0.63â€“1.4) and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.801.
