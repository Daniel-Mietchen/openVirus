<p>Three 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections were performed. As an infection control, simultaneous infections of 
 <italic>A. stephensi</italic>, which were reared at NIH, were performed, and the mean oocysts per mosquito in feedings #1, #2, and #3, were 56, 26, and 56, respectively, showing satisfactory uptake in the feeds. The results of two groups of 
 <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, both of which were cultured at CDC and shipped to NIH for SMFA testing at the same time, are presented in
