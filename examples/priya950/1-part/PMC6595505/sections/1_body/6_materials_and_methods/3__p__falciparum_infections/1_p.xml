 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infections were performed at the National Institutes of Health, Malaria Immunology Section in Bethesda, MD, USA. All infections were performed within BL2/Arthropod Containment Level 2 conditions. The gametocyte culture of the 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> NF54 line and standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA) were performed as described previously (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Miura et al. 2013</xref>) with three modifications. In this study, WT and TR mosquitoes were utilized in addition to 
 <italic>A. stephensi</italic> mosquitoes (a known susceptible species, to check on gametocyte uptake success). Second, all mosquitoes were fed gametocyte mixtures in normal human sera (without any transmission-blocking antibodies). Lastly, midguts from all mosquitoes with any eggs in their ovaries at the time of dissection (8 d after feed) were analyzed (instead of 
 <italic>n</italic> = 20 per group). The stage V gametocytemia in feeds 1, 2, and 3 were 1.88, 0.69, and 1.14%, respectively. Two different batches of pooled human sera (pools of 20 or 39 individual sera) were used in this study (one pool for feed 1 and 2, and the other pool for feed 3). Different batches of red blood cells were used for different feeding experiments. The human serum and RBC used in this study were purchased from Interstate Blood Bank, Inc. (Memphis, TN).
