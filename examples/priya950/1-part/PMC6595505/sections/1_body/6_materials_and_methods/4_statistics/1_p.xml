<p>In all statistical tests, the alpha was 0.05. Fisher’s exact probability test was used to compare the ONNV intrathoracic and oral infections. Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used for body part infection comparisons. Fisher’s exact probability test was used to analyze the proportion of mosquitoes infected (prevalence). The best estimate of oocyst ratio between WT and TR, the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and 
 <italic>P</italic>-values (whether there was a significant difference in oocyst density between WT and TR) from single or multiple feeds were calculated using a zero-inflated negative binomial random effect model, which was generated from a large SMFA data set along with 
 <italic>A. stephensi</italic> mosquitoes (
