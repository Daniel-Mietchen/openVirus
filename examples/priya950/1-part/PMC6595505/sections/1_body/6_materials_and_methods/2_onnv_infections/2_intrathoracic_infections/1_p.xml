<p>Cohorts of 30–50 adult TR and WT females were injected intrathoracically, using glass capillary pipettes heated and pulled to fine tips, with 1–2 µl of 0, 1, 2.5, and 3.5 Log
 <sub>10</sub> plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml stocks of ONNV infection dose (titers confirmed by back-titration on Vero cells of the stocks after inoculations). Mosquitoes were held for an extrinsic incubation period of 7 d at 27°C and 80% RH before being assayed. Twenty mosquitoes were harvested on day 7 postinfection (PI) for each infection dose. Each infected mosquito was placed in an Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) tube with 300 µl of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s essential medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and amphotericin B (50 μg/ml), triturated for 4 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant from each mosquito was screened for virus content by the induction of cytopathic effects (CPE) on Vero cells.
