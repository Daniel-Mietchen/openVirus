<p>From each dose batch, up to 30 potentially infected mosquito bodies and legs were placed in Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) tubes with 300 µl of DMEM containing 10% FBS, and amphotericin B (50 μg/ml), triturated for 4 min, and centrifuged. Supernatants from each body were screened for virus content by the induction of CPE on Vero cells. If body samples were positive, indicating initial oral infection, viral titers of bodies and legs (a proxy for dissemination into the hemocoel) were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells. If legs were positive, indicating a disseminated infection, saliva was assayed for CPE on Vero cells to detect ONNV.</p>
