<p>Mosquitoes were cultured at the insectaries of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Entomology Branch in Atlanta, GA, USA. The recorded air temperature and relative humidity (RH) in the insectaries were 27.4°C and 80.4% RH (SD 0.78 and 7.0, respectively), and larvae were cultured according to the standard operating procedure described in the supplemental material of Valerio et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Valerio et al. 2016a</xref>) using a larval diet designed for use in mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Damiens et al. 2012</xref>). For routine stock-keeping purposes, adult females were bloodfed on an anesthetized rabbit and all adults were provided with 10% sucrose in water containing 0.1% methylparaben (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Benedict et al. 2009</xref>). Use of this antimicrobial is the typical stock-keeping procedure in the CDC insectary. Transgenic and nontransgenic individuals were identified in the larval stage based on the 3X-P3 DsRed fluorescent transgene marker and males and females were separated in the pupa stage based on genitalia. Adults that were shipped for experimental infections were provided 10% sucrose in water that did not contain methylparaben to ensure that the antimicrobial activity did not affect pathogen development. Prior to shipping, females were allowed to mate with the sexually sterile Ag(DSM)2 transgenic males as a containment precaution. They were shipped in 9 cm diameter, 10 cm high polyethylene cups covered with screen tops and provided with 10% sucrose in containers approved for shipping transgenic mosquitoes (UN 3245). Only females were shipped and transit time was overnight. Female mosquitoes were 4–7-d old upon arrival at NIH or UTMB, and infections were performed the same or the following day.
