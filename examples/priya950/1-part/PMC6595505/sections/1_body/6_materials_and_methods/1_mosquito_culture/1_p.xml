<p>Transgenic (TR) Ag(DSM)2 females were backcrossed to G3 strain males (MRA-112, BEI Resources) to maintain the transgenic strain. This produced nontransgenic and heterozygous transgenic progeny in each generation with a normal sex ratio (1:1) and a 1:1 proportion of transgenic offspring, which is typical for this dominant Mendelian trait (
