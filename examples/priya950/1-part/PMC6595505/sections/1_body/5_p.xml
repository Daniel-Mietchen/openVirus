<p>We measured characteristics of vector competence for two relevant pathogens, 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, a causative agent of malaria, and o’nyong-nyong virus, which causes epidemics of a severe febrile, arthralgic syndrome often confused with dengue fever. O’nyong-nyong (ONNV) is one of the few viruses pathogenic to humans that 
 <italic>A. gambiae</italic> is capable of transmitting (
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Sim et al. 2014</xref>). In this report, transgenic and highly related nontransgenic sibling females were compared for their ability to develop these pathogens. The results are presented in the context of risk assessment in public health.
