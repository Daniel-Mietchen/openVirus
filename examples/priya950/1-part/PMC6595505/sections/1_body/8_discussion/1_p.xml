<p>With regard to two important pathogens transmitted by 
 <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, we observed few differences between WT and TR mosquitoes. ONNV virus was rarely detected in the saliva even after ingestion of large oral doses and 14 d of extrinsic incubation. The rate of saliva infection, the critical measure of vector competence, did not differ significantly between WT and TR mosquitoes. Apart from titers in infected mosquito legs following medium and high-dose blood meals, there was no evidence of a significant difference in the susceptibility, permissiveness for viral dissemination or for replication of ONNV between the WT versus TR populations. The ONNV titer in legs after oral infection with high dose was very low in the WT pooled leg sample, with a significantly lower mean than for the TR group at both of the higher doses. No significant difference was seen between WT and TR in the body samples at any dose. Although the logistic challenges of rearing mosquitoes in one location and performing infections in another precluded replicates of experiments, our data indicate no meaningful difference between the two mosquito strains in vector competence.
