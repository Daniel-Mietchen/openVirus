<p>Ag(DSM)2 is a sterile male strain that is intended only for small scale field study in Africa as a step in progressive biosafety and entomological testing, subject to regulatory approval. The intended releases that have now been approved by the National Biosafety Authority in Burkina Faso (approval number 2018–453) would consist predominantly of males, and the number of females that has been approved would be less than 25 individuals. Natural village level populations of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes in Burkina Faso are estimated at 100,000–500,000 males (with similar numbers of females) in a village of approximately 1 km
 <sup>2</sup> (

The release protocol involves intensive manual sorting to select males, however, even if a small number of transgenic females occur in the releases, due to low fitness characteristics in mating competitiveness and survival, the persistence of the trait in females in generations after release is expected to be very short (
