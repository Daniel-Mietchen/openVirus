<p>These results and similar laboratory assays of components of vector competence cannot fully capture the range and variation in response that might be encountered naturally. Whereas laboratory experiments such as these are conducted under controlled conditions to increase the experimental sensitivity to differences, a wider range of temperatures and genetic backgrounds would be experienced by transgenic individuals in the environment, both of which might affect vector competence. The results do provide an indicator of whether concern is warranted.</p>
