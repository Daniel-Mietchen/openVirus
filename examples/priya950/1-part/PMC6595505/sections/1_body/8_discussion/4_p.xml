<p>It is not apparent that there is any mechanism by which this particular transgene could affect the ability of mosquitoes that carry it to develop viruses or parasites. We are aware of only one report (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Pompon and Levashina 2015</xref>) of a common pathway between immunity and sexual sterility. In that report, an allele of an immune factor TEP1 that is known to affect 
 <italic>A. gambiae</italic> susceptibility to malaria parasites is also recruited to eliminate sperm in males that have DNA breakage due to irradiation. The Ag(DSM)2 strain has DNA breakage due to rDNA cleavage and it has also been observed to have morphologically defective sperm in the testes and spermatheca (C. Oliva, data not shown and personal communication) which might recruit this protein. In the experiments performed here, both TR and WT mosquitoes were mated to TR males and would have received a similar amount of TEP1 in the sperm. However, there is no information to indicate that this mode of transfer or amount would be likely to affect susceptibility of females.
