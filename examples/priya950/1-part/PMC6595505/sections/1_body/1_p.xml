<p>To complement existing interventions, transgenic mosquitoes are being developed in various laboratories that might offer an alternative method at a feasible cost (

A potentially powerful and economical method of introducing population suppression and antipathogen effectors into populations is via ‘gene drive’ which spreads transgenes at a rate higher than Mendelian inheritance predicts (
