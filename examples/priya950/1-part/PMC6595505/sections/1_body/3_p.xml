<p>Mating, life history, and sterility characteristics of one particular strain have been extensively studied in the laboratory. The strain, originally named ‘β2Ppo2’ (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>), has since been renamed Ag(DSM)2 by Target Malaria (targetmalaria.org), the research consortium responsible for its development. The strain is sexually sterile (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. 2012</xref>), but males have reduced mating competitiveness (

 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Facchinelli et al. 2015</xref>) and retarded larval development (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. 2012</xref>) compared to nontransgenic siblings.
