A relevant risk concern with transgenic mosquitoes is that their capacity to transmit known pathogens could be greater than the unmodified form. In this study, the ability to develop two human pathogens in these transgenic mosquitoes carrying a homing endonuclease which is expressed in the testes was compared with its nontransgenic siblings. Infections were performed with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (Welch) and o&#x02019;nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) and the results between the transgenic and nontransgenic sibling females were compared. There was no difference observed with ONNV isolate SG650 in intrathoracic infections or the 50% oral infectious dose measured at 14 d postinfection or in mean body titers. Some significant differences were observed for leg titers at the medium and highest doses for those individuals in which virus titer could be detected. No consistent difference was observed between the transgenic and nontransgenic comparator females in their ability to develop <italic>P. falciparum</italic> NF54 strain parasites. This particular transgene caused no significant effect in the ability of mosquitoes to become infected by these two pathogens in this genetic background. These results are discussed in the context of risk to human health if these transgenic individuals were present in the environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>competence</kwd><kwd>risk</kwd><kwd>transgenic</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>arbovirus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000865</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Open Philanthropy Project Fund</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Silicon Valley Community Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000923</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">NIAID</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000060</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">NIH</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Considerable progress is being made in reducing malaria transmission using entomological methods, primarily long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets and indoor residual insecticide spraying, along with improved diagnosis and treatment (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization 2015</xref>). A gap still exists between the most optimistic expected outcomes of existing interventions and elimination of malaria (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Rogerson 2016</xref>). In addition to the potential obstacles to effectiveness that insecticide and drug resistance present, the shortfall in effort needed for malaria elimination means that unless novel, less expensive and more effective interventions are developed, malaria elimination will remain an aspiration rather than a reality (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization 2015</xref>).</p><p>To complement existing interventions, transgenic mosquitoes are being developed in various laboratories that might offer an alternative method at a feasible cost (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">TDR/WHO 2010</xref>). Methods for both population reduction and population replacement (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Burt 2014</xref>) are envisioned, and considerable progress has been made developing these for <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> Giles (Diptera: Culicidae) (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Galizi et al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Hammond et al. 2016</xref>) and <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> Liston (Diptera: Culicidae) (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Isaacs et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Gantz et al. 2015</xref>), major vectors of human malaria parasites in Africa and Asia, respectively. A potentially powerful and economical method of introducing population suppression and antipathogen effectors into populations is via &#x02018;gene drive&#x02019; which spreads transgenes at a rate higher than Mendelian inheritance predicts (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Committee on Gene Drive Research in Non-Human Organisms: Recommendations for Responsible Conduct et al. 2016</xref>), but its development requires incremental testing of precursor technologies that demonstrate the safety and potential effectiveness of transgenic mosquitoes (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">WHO/FNIH 2014</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Committee on Gene Drive Research in Non-Human Organisms: Recommendations for Responsible Conduct et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>As part of this development pathway, a transgenic strain of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> that confers sexual sterility to males has been developed (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>). The effector protein, a fusion of <italic>I-PpoI</italic> DNA nuclease and enhanced green fluorescent protein (<italic>eGFP</italic>), cleaves a 15 bp target site in the 28S ribosomal DNA which consists of hundreds of copies and, in this species, is typically located exclusively on the X chromosome (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al. 1987</xref>). The resulting sexual sterility is a trait expressed only in males because the nuclease is controlled by a testes-specific promoter. A sufficient amount of the fusion protein is transported by all sperm produced in transgenic males to cleave the rDNA of the pronucleus so that embryos fail to develop (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>). As a consequence of complete male sexual sterility, the transgene must be maintained in mosquitoes by backcrossing transgenic females to nontransgenic males. This has been done using males of a &#x02018;wild-type&#x02019; laboratory strain, in this case one named &#x02018;G3&#x02019; (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. 2012</xref>). This process of repeated backcrossing and recombination in both sexes results in progeny in which populations consist of nontransgenic or heterozygous transgenic individuals. Individuals that carry the transgene are genetically distinguishable from those that do not only by the transgene and the immediate vicinity of the chromosome that might not have undergone recombination during the backcrossing process. These nontransgenic individuals provide a useful experimental comparator to test effects specifically due to the transgene in nearly identical genetic backgrounds.</p><p>Mating, life history, and sterility characteristics of one particular strain have been extensively studied in the laboratory. The strain, originally named &#x02018;&#x003b2;2Ppo2&#x02019; (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>), has since been renamed Ag(DSM)2 by Target Malaria (targetmalaria.org), the research consortium responsible for its development. The strain is sexually sterile (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. 2012</xref>), but males have reduced mating competitiveness (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Facchinelli et al. 2015</xref>) and retarded larval development (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. 2012</xref>) compared to nontransgenic siblings.</p><p>Assessing risk of these mosquitoes in the environment considers changes in the transgenic mosquito that could lead to harm in comparison to an unmodified form. Among changes that might be considered are changes in behavior, life history, and vectorial capacity. It is the latter that is relevant to this investigation.</p><p>We measured characteristics of vector competence for two relevant pathogens, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, a causative agent of malaria, and o&#x02019;nyong-nyong virus, which causes epidemics of a severe febrile, arthralgic syndrome often confused with dengue fever. O&#x02019;nyong-nyong (ONNV) is one of the few viruses pathogenic to humans that <italic>A. gambiae</italic> is capable of transmitting (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Sim et al. 2014</xref>). In this report, transgenic and highly related nontransgenic sibling females were compared for their ability to develop these pathogens.

This produced nontransgenic and heterozygous transgenic progeny in each generation with a normal sex ratio (1:1) and a 1:1 proportion of transgenic offspring, which is typical for this dominant Mendelian trait (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Windbichler et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. 2012</xref>). We will refer to the nontransgenic progeny as wild type (WT). Comparisons were made between TR and WT sibling females resulting from the same backcross.</p><p>Mosquitoes were cultured at the insectaries of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Entomology Branch in Atlanta, GA, USA. The recorded air temperature and relative humidity (RH) in the insectaries were 27.4&#x000b0;C and 80.4% RH (SD 0.78 and 7.0, respectively), and larvae were cultured according to the standard operating procedure described in the supplemental material of Valerio et al. (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Valerio et al. 2016a</xref>) using a larval diet designed for use in mosquitoes (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Damiens et al. 2012</xref>). For routine stock-keeping purposes, adult females were bloodfed on an anesthetized rabbit and all adults were provided with 10% sucrose in water containing 0.1% methylparaben (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Benedict et al. 2009</xref>). Use of this antimicrobial is the typical stock-keeping procedure in the CDC insectary. Transgenic and nontransgenic individuals were identified in the larval stage based on the 3X-P3 DsRed fluorescent transgene marker and males and females were separated in the pupa stage based on genitalia. Adults that were shipped for experimental infections were provided 10% sucrose in water that did not contain methylparaben to ensure that the antimicrobial activity did not affect pathogen development. Prior to shipping, females were allowed to mate with the sexually sterile Ag(DSM)2 transgenic males as a containment precaution. They were shipped in 9 cm diameter, 10 cm high polyethylene cups covered with screen tops and provided with 10% sucrose in containers approved for shipping transgenic mosquitoes (UN 3245). Only females were shipped and transit time was overnight. Female mosquitoes were 4&#x02013;7-d old upon arrival at NIH or UTMB, and infections were performed the same or the following day.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>ONNV Infections</title><p>Experimental ONNV infections were performed at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, TX, USA under arthropod containment level 2 conditions. ONNV strain SG650 was isolated from human serum in Uganda in 1996, passed twice in Vero cells and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for use in all experiments. A stock of titer 4.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> Vero cell plaque-forming units was used for mosquito infections.</p><sec id="s4"><title>Intrathoracic infections</title><p>Cohorts of 30&#x02013;50 adult TR and WT females were injected intrathoracically, using glass capillary pipettes heated and pulled to fine tips, with 1&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;l of 0, 1, 2.5, and 3.5 Log<sub>10</sub> plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml stocks of ONNV infection dose (titers confirmed by back-titration on Vero cells of the stocks after inoculations). Mosquitoes were held for an extrinsic incubation period of 7 d at 27&#x000b0;C and 80% RH before being assayed. Twenty mosquitoes were harvested on day 7 postinfection (PI) for each infection dose. Each infected mosquito was placed in an Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) tube with 300 &#x000b5;l of Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s essential medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and amphotericin B (50 &#x003bc;g/ml), triturated for 4 min, and centrifuged.

Infectious blood was heated to 37&#x000b0;C in a Hemotek feeding apparatus (Discovery Workshops, Accrington, Lancashire, UK) for 1 h.

Lastly, midguts from all mosquitoes with any eggs in their ovaries at the time of dissection (8 d after feed) were analyzed (instead of <italic>n</italic> = 20 per group). The stage V gametocytemia in feeds 1, 2, and 3 were 1.88, 0.69, and 1.14%, respectively. Two different batches of pooled human sera (pools of 20 or 39 individual sera) were used in this study (one pool for feed 1 and 2, and the other pool for feed 3). Different batches of red blood cells were used for different feeding experiments. The human serum and RBC used in this study were purchased from Interstate Blood Bank, Inc.

When all three feeding results were analyzed together, there was no significant difference in oocyst intensity: the best estimate of oocyst intensity ratio (oocyst intensity in TR over that in WT) = 0.95 (95% CI, 0.63&#x02013;1.4) and <italic>P</italic> = 0.801.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Discussion</title><p>With regard to two important pathogens transmitted by <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, we observed few differences between WT and TR mosquitoes. ONNV virus was rarely detected in the saliva even after ingestion of large oral doses and 14 d of extrinsic incubation. The rate of saliva infection, the critical measure of vector competence, did not differ significantly between WT and TR mosquitoes. Apart from titers in infected mosquito legs following medium and high-dose blood meals, there was no evidence of a significant difference in the susceptibility, permissiveness for viral dissemination or for replication of ONNV between the WT versus TR populations. The ONNV titer in legs after oral infection with high dose was very low in the WT pooled leg sample, with a significantly lower mean than for the TR group at both of the higher doses. No significant difference was seen between WT and TR in the body samples at any dose. Although the logistic challenges of rearing mosquitoes in one location and performing infections in another precluded replicates of experiments, our data indicate no meaningful difference between the two mosquito strains in vector competence.</p><p>Similarly, the absence of consistent differences observed in the prevalence and intensity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection in each assay. When data from all three assays are combined, the oocyst ratio between TR and WT was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.63&#x02013;1.4). If the assays were performed with higher mean oocysts and/or more mosquitoes were dissected per assay, or if more than three repeat feeds were performed, the range of 95% CI could become narrower. However, the insignificant result (<italic>P</italic> = 0.8) suggests that even if Ag(DSM)2 females were released into the environment, they would pose no additional risk to a release of the same number of wild-type females with regard to this characteristic.</p><p>These results and similar laboratory assays of components of vector competence cannot fully capture the range and variation in response that might be encountered naturally. Whereas laboratory experiments such as these are conducted under controlled conditions to increase the experimental sensitivity to differences, a wider range of temperatures and genetic backgrounds would be experienced by transgenic individuals in the environment, both of which might affect vector competence. The results do provide an indicator of whether concern is warranted.</p><p>It is not apparent that there is any mechanism by which this particular transgene could affect the ability of mosquitoes that carry it to develop viruses or parasites. We are aware of only one report (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Pompon and Levashina 2015</xref>) of a common pathway between immunity and sexual sterility. In that report, an allele of an immune factor TEP1 that is known to affect <italic>A. gambiae</italic> susceptibility to malaria parasites is also recruited to eliminate sperm in males that have DNA breakage due to irradiation. The Ag(DSM)2 strain has DNA breakage due to rDNA cleavage and it has also been observed to have morphologically defective sperm in the testes and spermatheca (C. Oliva, data not shown and personal communication) which might recruit this protein. In the experiments performed here, both TR and WT mosquitoes were mated to TR males and would have received a similar amount of TEP1 in the sperm. However, there is no information to indicate that this mode of transfer or amount would be likely to affect susceptibility of females.</p><p>Ag(DSM)2 is a sterile male strain that is intended only for small scale field study in Africa as a step in progressive biosafety and entomological testing, subject to regulatory approval. The intended releases that have now been approved by the National Biosafety Authority in Burkina Faso (approval number 2018&#x02013;453) would consist predominantly of males, and the number of females that has been approved would be less than 25 individuals. Natural village level populations of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes in Burkina Faso are estimated at 100,000&#x02013;500,000 males (with similar numbers of females) in a village of approximately 1 km<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Epopa et al. 2017</xref>). The release protocol involves intensive manual sorting to select males, however, even if a small number of transgenic females occur in the releases, due to low fitness characteristics in mating competitiveness and survival, the persistence of the trait in females in generations after release is expected to be very short (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Valerio et al. 2016b</xref>). Differences in infection rates due to any differences in vectorial capacity within the limited ranges shown in these tests would be undetectable in a natural population with the numbers of transgenic females potentially present.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Declarations</title><p>Ethics approval and consent to participate</p><p>No human subjects participated in this research.
