<p>The relationship between climate variables and the activity of influenza subtypes/lineages was evaluated on a monthly basis. 
 <xref rid="tab02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between the monthly influenza virus prevalence data and meteorological factors. A/H3N2 activity was positively associated with RH, while A/H1N1pdm09 activity was negatively associated with temperature, precipitation and VP. Higher level of sunshine hours and lower level of RH and VP was associated with increased prevalence of both Victoria and Yamagata. Additionally, Victoria activity was negatively associated with precipitation. Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses showed that higher A/H3N2 activity was only associated with higher RH (coefficient = 0.234, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.081), while A/H1N1pdm09 prevalence was only negatively correlated with VP (coefficient = −0.740, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002, adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.118). Higher Victoria activity was driven by lower RH (coefficient = −0.344, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.000, adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.239), while higher Yamagata activity was promoted by lower VP (coefficient = −0.663, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.013, adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.044).
