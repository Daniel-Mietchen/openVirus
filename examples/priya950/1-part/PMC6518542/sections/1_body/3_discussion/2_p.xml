<p>Our study found that the seasonal patterns among influenza subtypes/lineages were not the same and the associations with meteorological factors were different by subtype/lineage. A/H3N2 generally demonstrated an annual cycle with a peak in summer–autumn. An annual cycle with a peak mainly occurring in summer was observed for A/H3N2 during 2004–2013 in Hong Kong [

This association was partly consistent with previous epidemiological analyses in eastern and southern China, which found that RH was positively correlated with influenza A activity [

Additional surveillance data might be necessary to identify the epidemic pattern and climatic predictors of seasonal A/H1N1. A/H1N1pdm09 replaced seasonal A/H1N1 after the pandemic and exhibited an annual cycle with a peak in winter. Statistical analyses indicated that higher A/H1N1pdm09 activity was driven by lower AH. This relationship was also shown by previous analyses of A/H1N1pdm09 in temperate and subtropical/tropical regions [

 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Influenza B lineages showed an annual cycle, respectively, as previous studies of both influenza B lineages combined [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our study found that the peak month of Victoria mainly occurred in March while the peak month of Yamagata would occur during November–April. Regression analyses demonstrated that seasonal activity of Victoria was inversely associated with RH while Yamagata activity was negatively associated with AH. The inverse association between influenza B activity and humidity was different from previous studies in some subtropical cities, likes Hong Kong and Okinawa, which showed that the epidemics of all influenza B viruses combined could be promoted by higher RH/AH [

 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Animal experiments demonstrated that transmission of both influenza B lineages could be enhanced at colder temperature [
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. But the impact of humidity on influenza B transmission remains to be examined.
