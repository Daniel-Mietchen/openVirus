<p>Ten-year surveillance demonstrated non-stationary seasonality of composite influenza virus activity in Panzhihua. Although well-defined seasonal patterns, such as the annual or semi-annual cycles were observed in many subtropical regions, cities with non-stationary periodicity were also reported [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the seasonality of individual influenza subtypes/lineages and the seasonal drivers remain to be investigated.
