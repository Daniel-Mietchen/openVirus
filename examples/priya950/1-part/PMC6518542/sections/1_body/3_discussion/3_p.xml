<p>Differences in seasonality might be driven by several factors, including viral survival and transmission, host susceptibility and behaviour, and the environment. Our findings suggested that the different effects of weather conditions on influenza subtypes/lineages might be related to the regional heterogeneity of influenza seasonality. Animal experiments showed that aerosol transmission of type A and B influenza strains was highly effective at low temperature (5 °C) [

 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This temperature condition might be common in temperate region. However, Panzhihua is a warm subtropical city, with limited annual temperature differences. Over the 10-year surveillance, the lowest average monthly temperature was 13.1–13.6 °C in winter and the highest was 26.5–26.6 °C in late spring and early summer. Therefore, the association of temperature with influenza epidemics might not be significant. Our analyses showed that the associations between humidity and influenza activity varied by subtype/lineage in Panzhihua. This might indicate that at the context of a subtropical city, each influenza subtype/lineage could have a most suitable humidity with different temperature condition. RH might perform effects on influenza virus transmission at different level [
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Aerosol transmission of influenza A could be maximal at low RH (20% and 35%) while minimal at high RH (80%). Notably, effective transmission (75% or 100%) of type A influenza virus was also observed at 20 °C and 65% RH. The peak months of A/H3N2 mainly occurred in August–September coinciding with the peak months of RH in Panzhihua. In August–September, the average monthly temperature was 23.5–22.6 °C and average monthly RH was 69.4–70.3%, which might support the active transmission of A/H3N2. While lower AH/RH in winter–spring might be more suitable for virus activity of A/H1N1pdm09, Victoria and Yamagata. Previous epidemiological analyses, for example, in Hong Kong and Suzhou, showed that higher RH was correlated with higher influenza A activity [

 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, these studies did not analyze influenza A subtypes or influenza B lineages separately. In addition, RH is a measure of the water content in a gas, relative to the maximum capacity of that gas to hold water vapour at a given temperature. RH reflects human's feeling of humidity while AH measures the mass of water vapour per unit volume of a gas. It is suggested that aerosol transmission of influenza virus shows a direct dependence on AH, rather than varying with both RH and temperature [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, several transmission results based on RH and temperature could not be explained by AH alone [
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is possible that humidity (either RH or AH) and temperature affect transmission of influenza subtypes/lineages by more than one mechanism.
