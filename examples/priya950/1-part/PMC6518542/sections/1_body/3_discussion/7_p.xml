<p>This study expands our knowledge regarding the epidemiological characteristics of individual influenza subtypes/lineages as well as the association with meteorological factors in the subtropics. In summary, we found differences in seasonality and different associations with climatic variables by subtypes/lineages. These findings revealed that the role of weather conditions in regulating virus activity could be complicated which might be related to the diverse transmission modes and mechanism of influenza virus. Studies of influenza seasonality and its relationship with climatic drivers should therefore account for individual subtypes/lineages. Moreover, it is necessary to increase year-round influenza surveillance and develop subtype/lineage-specific prevention and control measures. In addition, QIV is recommended to provide protection against both influenza B lineages.</p>
