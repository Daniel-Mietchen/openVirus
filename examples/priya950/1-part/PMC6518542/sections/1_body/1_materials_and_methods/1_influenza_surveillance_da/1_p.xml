<p>Epidemiological and virologic data during 2006–2015 in Panzhihua were obtained from the Chinese National Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (CNISN). Panzhihua is located at the 26.57°N and 101.67°E and is characterised by a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate [

Influenza surveillance was conducted year-round based on a sentinel hospital-based influenza surveillance system, including two Grade III level A hospitals (top-class in China) in Panzhihua. In each hospital, 5–15 (⩾20 since 2013) nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected each week from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), who had not received antiviral treatment and within 3 days after the onset of symptoms. ILI was defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as sudden onset of fever with measured body temperature ⩾38 °C and a cough or sore throat in the absence of other diagnoses. Madin–Darby canine kidney cells and/or specific pathogen-free chicken embryos were used to inoculate clinical specimens. The types, subtypes and lineages of influenza isolates were identified by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and/or real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assay. During 2006–2008, virus culture and HI test were used to identify types, subtypes and lineages of influenza isolates. From 2009 to 2015, both virus culture and rRT-PCR assay were applied although the majority of specimens were identified by virus culture and HI test. A total of 83.0%, 40.2%, 98.0%, 96.4%, 79.4%, 99.3% and 91.5% of specimens tested in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, were subtyped using virus culture and HI test. ILI consultation and influenza virologic surveillance were carried out based on the guideline for national influenza surveillance [
