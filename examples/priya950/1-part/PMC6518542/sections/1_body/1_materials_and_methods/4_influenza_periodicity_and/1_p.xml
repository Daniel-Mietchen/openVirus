<p>Three pre-pandemic years (2006–2008), the pandemic year (2009) and six post-pandemic years (2010–2015) were included in the analyses. Unsubtyped influenza A virus-positive isolates were allocated to A/H3N2, seasonal A/H1N1 or A/H1N1pdm09, according to the seasonal ratio of each subtype. Influenza B virus-positive specimens that were not determined were allocated to Victoria, or Yamagata, according to the seasonal ratio of each lineage, excluding 2010 when 24 out of 33 (72.3%) influenza B virus-positive specimens were not determined. Because the A/H1N1pdm09 did not emerge in Panzhihua until October 2009, the annual ratio of 2009 was separately calculated for the first 9 months and the remaining 3 months. Time series of the monthly influenza-positive rates which were calculated as monthly numbers of positive specimens (all influenza viruses, or each A subtype, or each B lineage) divided by monthly total numbers of specimens tested were compiled.</p>
