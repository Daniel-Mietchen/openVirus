  <p>Composite influenza virus activity in Panzhihua during 2006â€“2015. (a) The monthly positive rate of all influenza viruses combined and the monthly positive numbers of laboratory-confirmed A/H3N2, seasonal A/H1N1, A/H1N1pdm09, Victoria and Yamagata cases. (b) Wavelet power spectrum of the monthly activity of all influenza viruses combined. Black lines highlight periodicities that reach statistical significance of 95% based on 1000 Monte Carlo simulation. The region outside the white-curved cone indicates the presence of edge effects. The power values were shown in the panel on the right. Time series have been square-root transformed.</p>
