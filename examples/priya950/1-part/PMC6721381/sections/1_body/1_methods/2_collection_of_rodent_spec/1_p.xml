<p id="Par16">In order to figure out the potential rodents population and virus-carrying rate of Hebei province, four separated surveillance points (Luan county, Xinji city, Dingzhou city and Xian county) were set up since 2007 and two more points (Guantao county and Kuancheng Man Autonomous county) were added since 2015 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In each surveillacnce point, the rodents were captured with rattraps and baited with peanuts according to related National Survellance Program during annual spring and autumn. In field areas, which include grassland, woodland and footpath besides farms, the rattraps were set as parallel lines letting interval distance as 20 m for each line and 5 m for each rattrap. Set one rattrap per 10–20 square meters in residential areas, including granary, barn and outdoor cooking bench, where had been obtained individual consent from local residents. All rattraps were set before night and recovered in next morning. After identification of species through morphological observation, captured rats were narcotized by pentobarbital sodium, then dissected and extracted lung tissue sterilely. Lung tissues of rodents were immediately stored into liquid nitrogen until further laboratory test. All sections of this report adhere to the ARRIVE Guidelines for reporting animal research. A completed ARRIVE guidelines checklist is included in Additional file
