<p id="Par11">Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease caused by hantaviruses which circulate worldwide posing the ongoing public health threat in most countries of Europe and Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. HFRS emerged in China among the early 1930s, and to date 29 of 31 provinces had reported the epidemics of this zoonotic disease. So far, 60,000–100,000 HFRS cases are collectively reported worldwide each year, with the majority occurring in China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thanks to lots of comprehensive preventive measures, such as the national immunization programs, a dramatical decline of the incidence of HFRS among China was observed since the beginning of the new century [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, it has been suggested that the real epidemic occurring in Western World were probably underestimated or even neglected because of the lower medical awareness for detecting milder or atypical cases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Human infections with hantaviruses are generally associated with inhalating the aerosolized excreta of virus-carring rodents [
