<p id="Par31">As a zoonotic disease, the incidence of HFRS has a close relationship with the local population of rodents, including host density and virus-carrying rate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The annual host densities in Hebei province were drastically fluctuated indicating that the rodent habitted ecology environment was flimsy. While an apparent peak of virus-carrying rate was solely observed in Luan county, where was the high-incidence region of HFRS during the third epidemic phase indicating that virus-carrying rate play a more significant role to affect incidence of HFRS infection. Therefore, virus-carrying rate should be considered as a significant surveillance indicator to alert next HFRS epidemic. In addition, deratization especially in the residential area should be encouraged, cause the higher host density has made people under high exposure risk of rodent-borne pathogenic viruses including hantaviruses.
