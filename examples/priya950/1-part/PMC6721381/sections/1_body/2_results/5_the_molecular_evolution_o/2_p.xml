<p id="Par26">All variations of the viral nucleotides we identified are substitutions without any indel and most of them are non-signification. Among the 36 amino acid sequences of the viral partial glycoproteins, three sites (A647V, V652I and T690R) of five sequences are shown with single mutation compared to the strain isolated from Qinhuangdao in 1993 (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). The partial glycoprotein gene we amplified covers the end of Gn gene and the head of Gc gene, and all three mutated sites are in this extra-membrane part of Gc protein that will be present on the surface of mature viral particle.
