<p id="Par25">Not all virus-carrying lung samples detected by IFA for positive could be successfully detected by RT-PCR due to the different thresholds. Totally, only 36 lung tissues of rodents captured from the northeastern cities of the province, Chengde, Tangshan and Qinhuangdao where were the current high-incidence area for HFRS, were detected for positive by RT-PCR of partial M segment (1934–2353 bp, total 420 bp). The phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences showed that hantaviruses circulating in Hebei province evolved slowly and they all belonged to 
 <italic>Seoul virus</italic> S3 genotype (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). It is shown that the hantaviruses identified in 1993 had an apparent genetic difference with the viruses identified in last decade. However, there was no significant genetic divergence between each hantaviruses identified during this ten-year period (2007–2016), neither in different areas nor different years.
