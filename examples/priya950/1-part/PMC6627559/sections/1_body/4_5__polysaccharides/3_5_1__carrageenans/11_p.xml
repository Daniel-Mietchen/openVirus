<p>The study of Fazekas T. et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] was very important, because it was conducted in a clinical setting with the participation of patients (children and adults aged from 1 to 18 years) with respiratory viral infections, including influenza B. Intranasal spray was used three times a day in for seven days. Symptom dynamics was monitored and viral load was determined. In this study iota-carrageenan did not alleviate symptoms in children with acute symptoms of common cold, but significantly reduced viral load in nasal secretions that may have important implications for future studies. In this study, v-carrageenan as part of the spray did not reduce the severity of symptoms in children with acute cold symptoms, but significantly reduced the viral load in the nasal lavage of patients who received the spray compared with the control group (27% versus 13%, respectively).
