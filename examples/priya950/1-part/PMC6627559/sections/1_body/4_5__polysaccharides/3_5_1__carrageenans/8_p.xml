The authors showed that the polysaccharide specifically and effectively inhibited the reproduction of the influenza virus. The MDCK cells were infected with various strains of the influenza virus, after which they were treated with carrageenan at different doses. After 24 h, a dose-dependent decrease in the titer of SW731 and CA04 viruses (homologous MDCK) was recorded. The remaining experimental strains of influenza virus (PR8, WSN, ZB07, and H1N1) were insensitive to carrageenan. Thus, k-carrageenan prevented the development of the extra- and intracellular stages of influenza virus replication. To determine the stage of reproduction of the virus affected by carrageenan, the authors added polysaccharide to infected cells during the period of adsorption (0 h), internalization (1 h), early replication (2â€“6 h), and release (8 h). Then, after 24 h, the inhibitory effect was evaluated, in response to treatment at the time points of 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h. After 8 h, there was no inhibition. Thus, it was shown that not only extracellular, but also some intracellular stages of influenza virus replication were affected by k-carrageenan. The titer of influenza virus SW731 was decreased in cases where the virus was treated with the polysaccharide before or during infection of the cells. When treating cells with carrageenan, there was no such effect, i.e. the best results were obtained by the action of the polysaccharide at the adsorption stage. The same authors showed that carrageenan does not inactivate the influenza virus, since no differences were found between the pre-treatment group and the adsorption group. Carrageenan specifically inhibited the binding of the HA virus to its receptor, sialic acid. The effect of polysaccharides on the exit stage was insignificant. The authors have proposed the use of carrageenan against the H1N1/2009 influenza virus and other viruses containing HA/H1N1/2009. The carrageenan used in these experiments contained both high- and low-molecular components, and therefore it acted on the extracellular and intracellular stages of reproduction.
