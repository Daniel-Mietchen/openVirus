<p>Carrageenans have attracted the attention of researchers investigating the problem of influenza and other acute respiratory viral infections, particularly in terms of the possibility of creating a physical barrier in the nasal cavity against respiratory viruses, including the flu virus [
 <xref rid="B55-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. For this purpose, kappa (k), iota (ι), and lambda (λ) carrageenans were used. It is known that carrageenans block the interaction of viruses with cells and also inhibit the formation of a syncytium, induced by influenza A viruses. A. Leibbrand et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] carried out an investigation showing the effectiveness of carrageenan against human influenza A viruses. The authors determined the sensitivity of the H1N1 influenza virus strains, as well as the pandemic H3N2 strain, to carrageenan subtypes ι and k using the plaque formation method in canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK). The most active in this test was ι-carrageenan (IC
 <sub>50</sub> or 50% inhibitory concentration = 0.04 μg/mL); k-carrageenan was less active (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.3 μg/mL). The purity of the ι- and k-carrageenans used in these studies was above 95%, and the molecular weight of both polymers was more than 100,000 Da. At the concentrations of 40 and 4 µg/mL, ι-carrageenan effectively reduced viral replication by 2–4 log units within 96 h after infection. Thus, it was found that ι-carrageenan contributes to the survival of cells infected with the virus by direct exposure to the virus. In another series of experiments, the same authors investigated the effect of carrageenans on an influenza virus-infected primary cell culture of the human epithelium from the nasal cavity. Under these conditions, ι-carrageenan inhibited the formation of plaques by the pandemic strain H1N1/2009 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> about 0.04 µg/mL). At the same time, an interesting fact was established: to obtain an effect when cells were infected with another virus (A/PR8/34 H1N1), a higher concentration of polysaccharide was required, i.e., the sensitivity of different strains to carrageenan was different.
