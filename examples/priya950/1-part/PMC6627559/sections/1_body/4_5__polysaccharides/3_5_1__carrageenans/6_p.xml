<p>Unfortunately, the solubility of carrageenans is limited, especially in aqueous solutions containing potassium and calcium ions [
 <xref rid="B52-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], since in their presence carrageenans form viscous gels. Another disadvantage of carrageenans is their anticoagulant properties. Despite this, Î¹-carrageenan has passed clinical trials and a nasal spray based on it has already been successfully sold in Europe for use in viral infections of the respiratory tract in humans. The effectiveness of the spray for ARIs was also reported by Eccles et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The authors showed that, compared with persons receiving placebo, patients in the experimental group noted such significantly reduced symptoms of the disease as nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, and sneezing. Moreover, nasal congestion at the end of the observation period was noted by 63.6% of persons in the placebo group and 28.6% of the group receiving carrageenan. Viral capacity in the nasal mucosa in patients treated with the spray was significantly decreased (92%), while placebo treatment did not affect viral replication. The nasal spray was effective when used during the first 48 h after the onset of symptoms. Similar results were obtained by Ludvig et al. [
