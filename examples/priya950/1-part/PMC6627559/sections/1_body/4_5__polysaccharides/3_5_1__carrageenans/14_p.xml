<p>Zanamivir and carrageenan separately exhibited different antiviral activity against different strains of the influenza virus. Since the mechanism of action of these agents is quite different, one could expect protection against a wider spectrum of viruses than with their individual use. Both compounds and the complex preparation were non-toxic at the highest concentration (400 μg/mL zanamivir and 533 μg/mL carrageenan). The effectiveness of the suppression of the replication by both substances depended on the virus strain. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for zanamivir ranged from 0.18 µg/mL for H5N1 and 22.97 µg/mL for H7N7. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for carrageenan ranged from 0.39 µg/mL to 118.40 µg/mL for H1N1 and H7N7, respectively. Thus, zanamivir and carrageenan target different strains of influenza virus to varying degrees and, therefore, they can provide broader anti-influenza activity by acting synergistically. At the same time, the physical interaction of carrageenan with the virus did not violate the inhibition of NA by zanamivir. The effectiveness of the spray increased when ı-and k-carrageenans were used simultaneously. Mice infected with a lethal dose of the influenza virus that received the placebo dies, as did the animals in all groups receiving monotherapy; however, the combined spray statistically significantly increased the survival of animals. The authors believed that if a vaccine does not keep up with a virus that has changed its composition, such a spray will to some extent protect the population from the impending epidemic.
