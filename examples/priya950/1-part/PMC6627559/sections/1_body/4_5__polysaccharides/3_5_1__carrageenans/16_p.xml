<p>Thus, carrageenan is currently widely used as a therapeutic and prophylactic agent and was also proposed as an integral part of various antiviral drugs. On the other hand, there is evidence in the literature that oral administration of carrageenan by laboratory animals can lead to the development of inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract [

 <xref rid="B70-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, carrageenan compounds are considered safe and approved for use [

The Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) concluded that the use of carrageenan is acceptable, even in childhood: “The use of carrageenan in a formula for children or for special medical purposes at concentrations up to 1000 mg/mL does not cause concern” [

Some authors combine low molecular weight products of carrageenan hydrolysis, such as polyginan and degraded carrageenan, which are clearly toxic, and native non-degraded food carrageenan, which is considered safe, under the general term “carrageenan” [
