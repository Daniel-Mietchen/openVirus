<p>Fucoidans are highly sulphated, usually branched polysaccharides, often containing, in addition to fucose residues, glucose, galactose, xylose, mannose, and uronic acids, as well as acetyl groups [
 <xref rid="B45-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The structures of polysaccharides from brown algae are very diverse and depends on the type of alga, its reproductive status, and other abiotic factors. In fact, each new polysaccharide isolated from algae is a new substance, and its molecule contain unique structural elements. This is why the determination of the structure of fucoidans, as well as the clarification of the structure/function relationship of these polysaccharides, is extremely difficult.
