<p>In another study [
 <xref rid="B81-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], as a result of a comparative study of sulphated polysaccharides activity from algae of different families (red algae: 
 <italic>Polysiphonia lanosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Furcellaria lumbricalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Palmaria palmate</italic>; brown algae: 
 <italic>Ascophyllum nodosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Fucus vesiculosis</italic>; green alga: 
 <italic>Ulva latuca</italic>), it was found that fucoidans from brown algae, i.e., 
 <italic>F. vesiculosis</italic> and 
 <italic>A. nodosum</italic>, had the highest anti-influenza activity. The total sugar content in the polysaccharides studied varied from 15.4% (
 <italic>U. latuca</italic>) to 91.4% (
 <italic>F. lumbricalis</italic>). Galactans (agars or carrageenans) were mainly isolated from 
 <italic>P. lanosa</italic>, xylans from 
 <italic>P. palmate</italic>, and fucoidans from brown algae. Heteropolysaccharides were isolated from green algae.
