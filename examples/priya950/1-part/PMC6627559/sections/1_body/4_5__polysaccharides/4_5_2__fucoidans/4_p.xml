<p>A study on the anti-influenza activity of polysaccharides from the sporophylls of the brown alga 
 <italic>Undaria pinnatifida</italic> allowed Synytsya et al. [
 <xref rid="B78-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] to establish that in mice, infected in vivo with avian influenza A viruses (subtypes H5N3 and H7N2), the level of virus replication decreased and the production of specific antibodies increased. Oral administration of the polysaccharide blocked the release of the virus from cells and significantly increased the titer of virus-neutralizing antibodies and IgA. This polysaccharide presents as a low molecular weight (Mw 9 kDa) fucogalactan, consisting of partially sulphated and acetylated fucose and galactose residues in approximately equal amounts and having a complex structure. Previously, Hayashi et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] investigated the effectiveness of this 
 <italic>O</italic>-acetylated sulphated fucogalactan in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza virus. The use of this polysaccharides reduced virus replication, weight loss, and mortality in animals of both groups and increased their lifespan. Oral administration of fucoidan caused an increase in the titre of neutralizing antibodies in the blood and mucous membranes. In immunocompromised mice, drug-resistant viruses often multiply after treatment with oseltamivir. No resistant viruses were isolated from mice treated with fucoidan. The authors proposed the combined treatment with oseltamivir and fucoidan, because in this case there was no recurrence of influenza virus reproduction, as is sometimes the case when treating only with oseltamivir. Combined treatment with fucoidan and oseltamivir was thus recommended by the authors as a new treatment strategy for influenza infection.
