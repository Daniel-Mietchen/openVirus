<p>After administration, these polysaccharides can be detected in the urine and serum [

The same authors established the active transport of fucoidan through a monolayer of Caco2 cells in vitro and the excretion of fucoidan in the urine of a patient after oral administration. The level of fucoidan increased from 3 to 9 h after administration [
