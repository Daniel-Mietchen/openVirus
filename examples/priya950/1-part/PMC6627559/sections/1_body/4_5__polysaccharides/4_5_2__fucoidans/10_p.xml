<p>Based on this evidence, fucoidans have not only a direct effect on influenza viruses but also affect the processes of viral attachment and replication, interact with neuraminidase, and inhibit the release of viruses from cells [

Another positive quality of fucoidans is their antibacterial action, which in some cases will allow them to be used to prevent bacterial complications, which often aggravates the course of influenza infection.
