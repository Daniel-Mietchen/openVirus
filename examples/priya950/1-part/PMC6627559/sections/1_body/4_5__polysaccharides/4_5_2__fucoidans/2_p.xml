<p>It should be noted that the effectiveness of fucoidans of brown algae as potential anti-influenza agents has been studied quite actively in recent years due to the polyvalence of their effects (antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effects, etc.), as well as the fact that fucoidans penetrate biological membranes. Efficiency of oral administration of fucoidan is confirmed by data of its transformation in macroorganism, which are presented in articles [

 <xref rid="B74-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The possibility of the appearance of fucoidan derivatives in the peripheral blood was confirmed by Irhimeh M.R. et al. [

Authors using monoclonal antibodies to highly sulfated fucoidan found its derivatives in plasma of healthy participants who took orally for 12 days at 3 g/d Undaria algae powder, containing 10% of fucoidan derivatives and purified galactofucane sulfate. The average concentration of fucoidan detected in plasma was 4.002 mg/L and 12.989 mg/L, respectively. Tokita Y. et al. [

These facts indicate the possibility of degradation of fucoidan molecules in the human body and the participation of its derived structures in the implementation of antiviral properties.
