<p>The interaction between the H5N1 influenza virus and fucoidan were investigated by Bobrovnitsky [
 <xref rid="B86-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. For the first time, the authors visualized this process by scanning probe microscopy, which provides information about the surface microrelief and measures the length and height of observed objects. In this case, measurements were made of the height of viral particles before and after treatment with fucoidans from two types of algae. The concentration of fucoidans was 1 and 100 ng/mL. It was found that the average size of the virus particles after treatment with fucoidans changed significantly. In the case of a lower concentration, the average height of the particles increased from 40 to 45 nm. With increasing concentrations, the height of the virus particles reached 50 nm. These results indicate an interaction between the positively charged groups of lipoproteins of the viral envelope and the negatively charged sulphate groups of fucoidans; this interaction may be the cause of the antiviral effect of polysaccharides. The antiviral effect of these compounds is probably due to the encapsulation of viral particles and their deactivation as a result of this. Adhesion of fucoidan on the surface of viral particles is an irreversible process.
