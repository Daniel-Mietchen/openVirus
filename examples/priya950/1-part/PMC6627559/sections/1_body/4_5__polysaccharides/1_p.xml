<p>These compounds represent a class of biopolymers, the content and structure of which vary depending on the type of algae, its place of growth, climatic conditions, harvest season, method of extraction and many other factors [

According to the literature, sulphated polysaccharides (fucoidans, galactofucans, dextran sulphates, carrageenans, sulphated chitosans, synthetic polyvinyl, and polyethylene sulphates) have antiviral activity not only against the influenza virus but also against many other viruses, such as those that cause hepatitis C, tick-borne encephalitis, haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, dengue fever, and AIDS. It is known that, in the human body, the most prevalent heteropolysaccharides are glycosaminoglycans, negatively charged long unbranched polysaccharides consisting of disaccharides repeating units [
 <xref rid="B42-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The binding of glycosamines with different ligands leads to post-translational modifications that facilitate cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The glycosaminoglycans, a class of heparan/heparan sulphates present in the basement membrane, in the extracellular matrix, and on the cell surface that are able to specifically interact with macromolecules of the extracellular matrix (fibronectin and laminin), enzymes, and an extensive class of heparan-binding molecules (growth factors and chemokines) [

 <xref rid="B43-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Sulphated polysaccharides of algae are natural mimics of heparan sulphates. Fucoidans and carrageenans can mimic the action of endogenous factors and regulate the functions of microorganism systems through key cell and enzyme receptors. Due to this, sulphated polysaccharides have the ability to bind to various receptors on the surface of the host cell and compete with viruses for glycoprotein receptors [
