<p>In this regard, we need new therapeutic approaches and broad-spectrum drugs. Drugs aimed at various viruses or impairing different stages of influenza virus replication will represent a serious means of fighting infections and minimizing the development of resistant viruses. The sulphated polysaccharides of algae (red, brown and green), such as carrageenans, fucoidans, and ulvans, have been studied as anti-influenza drugs and met these requirements. At the same time, there are other compounds from algae that also have antiviral effects, including anti-influenza action, which should be subjected to further experimental and clinical study.</p>
