<p>Transcription and replication of virus-specific RNAs are carried out by a viral polymerase complex. Unlike the polymerases of eukaryotic cells, viral polymerase has no error correction mechanism. Therefore, the frequency of mutations of the viral genome is, according to various estimates, from 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 10
 <sup>−6</sup> nucleotides per replication cycle [

 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is several orders of magnitude higher than the rate of mutation in bacteria and eukaryotes [

Thus, it can cause annual epidemics, despite the formation of an immune layer in the population due to vaccination and natural incidence. In addition, as result of the use of antiviral drugs, drug-resistant strains of the virus have developed, leading in a decrease in the effectiveness of antiviral chemotherapy [
