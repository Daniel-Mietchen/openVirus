<p>The NA of influenza destroys sialic acid-based cell receptors on infected cell surfaces and on virions after generation, and thereby prevents virion self-aggregation, facilitating the passage of the virus through mucin during a natural infection. In influenza A viruses, there are nine subtypes of NA, but there is only one NA in B and C viruses. The NA separates the virions from sialylated mucins that cover the mucosa, promoting virus attachment to the surface of epithelial cells. At the end of the replication cycle, it helps to separate mature virions from epithelial cells. In both cases, NA acts as a spreading factor, expanding the area of infection. That is why antibodies to NA show a protective effect, but weaker than antibodies against HA [
