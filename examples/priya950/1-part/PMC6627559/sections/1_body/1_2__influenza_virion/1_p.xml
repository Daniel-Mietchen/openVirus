<p>Influenza virions are particles with a diameter of 80â€“100 nm, coated with a lipid membrane with an integrated surface of three types of glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and the viral ion channel (M2) [
 <xref rid="B13-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On one side, this membrane is in contact with the cytoplasmic domains of HA and NA, and on another, with the core of the virion. The ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is represented by eight segments of the genome: single-stranded negative-polarity RNA in a complex with the nucleoprotein protein and three subunits of the polymerase complex [

 <xref rid="B15-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. After the virus enters the cell, the ribonucleoprotein gets to the nucleus, where transcription, translation, and replication of segments of the viral genome occur (
