<p>The binding of the influenza virus with cell sial-containing receptors creates surface glycoproteins, i.e., hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and viral ion channel (M2). Influenza virus penetration into the cell and fusion with endosome: HA contributes to the release of free nucleocapsid in the cytoplasm (the so-called fusion sites). M2 is involved process of "disassembly" of the virus in endosomes and the Golgi apparatus. Transcription and replication of the viral genome creates transcription and replication of virus-specific RNAs carried out by a viral polymerase complex. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) enters the cytoplasm and then into the nucleus. The release of the RNA virus in the cytoplasm allows for NA to end the replication and helps to separate matured virion from epithelial cells. Further, the matrix protein (M1) comes into contact with the cytoplasmic domains of HA, NA, and the core of virion. M1 plays an important role in the assembly and disassembly processes of new virus particle.</p>
