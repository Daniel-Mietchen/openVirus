<p>The pharmaceutical market currently offers a carrageenan-based spray for local (intranasal) application. There are no other drugs based on polysaccharides, which is associated with difficulties in standardization. To standardize these compounds, the physicochemical parameters such as molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, degree of sulphation and other structural features of polysaccharides should be determined. One approach to solving this problem is to obtain structurally characterized and homogeneous samples of native polysaccharides with a low molecular weight or oligomeric fractions. At the same time, due to the wide spectrum of biological activity of polysaccharides and, most importantly, their ability to exert a virucidal effect, that prevent the penetration of influenza viruses into cells and suppress the replication of viral particles, these unique compounds can be used as the basis for the creation of a new generation of medicines. In addition, the almost complete absence of toxicity and pathogen resistance, relatively low cost, a significant yield of the final product, good solubility, significant reserves of natural sources, and the possibility of cultivation algae make polysaccharides promising candidates for the development of drugs with antiviral activity, in particular anti-influenza activity.</p>
