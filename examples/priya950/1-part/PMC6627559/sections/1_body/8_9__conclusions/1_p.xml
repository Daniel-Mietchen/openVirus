<p>Last decade, there have been many works devoted to the antiviral potencies of sulphated polysaccharides. The formation of pathogen resistance to drugs on the pharmaceutical market requires new approaches to the treatment of viral diseases, including influenza. To do this, it is necessary to have drugs with different mechanisms of action, which in addition to antiviral effects, have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activity and to which viruses form resistance only on rare occasions. As presented in this review, the sulphated polysaccharides of brown, red, and green algae have such properties in relation to influenza infection (
