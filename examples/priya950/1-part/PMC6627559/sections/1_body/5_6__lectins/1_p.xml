<p>Lectins are widespread carbohydrate-binding proteins and glycoproteins that can specifically and reversibly non-covalently bind mono- and oligosaccharides, both in solution and localized on the cell surface [

 <xref rid="B90-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In this way, lectins contribute the so-called first line of defence against bacteria and viruses. These compounds exhibit high specificity in relation of glycoconjugates of bacteria and viruses. Most studied and characterized lectins have been isolated from higher plants; lectins from algae have been studied less thoroughly. However, the observed antiviral and antitumor effects of these compounds have led scientists to look at them from a new perspective. It was previously known that lectins have two or more carbohydrate-binding sites [

 <italic>Oscillatoria agardhii</italic> (OAA) [

 <xref rid="B93-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], as well as in the red algae 
 <italic>Eucheuma serra</italic> and 
 <italic>Kappaphycus alvaresii</italic> (KAA-2) [
 <xref rid="B96-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. They usually have two or four tandem repeats consisting of highly conserved sequences, but do not have homology with other protein families. The uniqueness of these lectins is that they bind carbohydrates with exceptionally high specificity for high-mannose (HM) glucans in the trisaccharide core, including Manα(1-3) Manα(1-6)Man. At low nanomolar levels, these lectins have potential antiviral activity against the influenza virus due to the recognition of HM-glucans in the composition of the glycoproteins of the spikes of the influenza virus.
