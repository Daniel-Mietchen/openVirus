<p>In the study by Sato et al. [
 <xref rid="B99-marinedrugs-17-00373" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], the anti-influenza activity of lectins with various carbohydrate specificities was investigated on MDCK cells using different strains (clinical isolates) of the influenza virus (H1N1-2009, A/Oita/ou1P3-3/09). The best results in terms of inhibiting influenza infection were obtained with the HM-binding lectin ESA-2. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> in this case was 12.4 nM. This lectin recognized the branched structure of HM-glycans, including the trisaccharide containing Manα(1-3)Manα(1-6)Man in the D2 branch as a primary target. The direct interaction between the lectin ESA-2 with the viral envelope glycoprotein HA was demonstrated by ELISA. This interaction was effectively suppressed by glycoproteins carrying HM-glycans, suggesting that ESA-2 binds to the HA of the influenza virus through HM-glycans. The lectin inhibited the penetration of the virus into cells most effectively when simultaneously introducing the virus and the lectin into the cell culture. When processing ESA-2 cells, viral antigens were not detected in the cells, which indicated that this lectin inhibited the initial stages of virus penetration into the cells. At the same time, no cytopathic effect was observed in infected cells. The antiviral profile of ESA-2 was similar to the lectin KAA-2 from 
 <italic>Kappaphycus alvarezii</italic>, which belongs to the same anti-HIV lectin family [

 <sub>50</sub> 17.2 ± 3.9) and WSN/33 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 34.6 ± 2.7 nM). In this case it was also proposed to use the lectin ESA-2 in the future as a disinfectant or prophylactic agent.
