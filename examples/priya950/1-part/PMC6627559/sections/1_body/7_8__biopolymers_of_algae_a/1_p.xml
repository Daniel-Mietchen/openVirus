<p>Biopolymers of algae are currently being also investigated as candidate adjuvants for the next generation of influenza vaccines. The main direction of improvement for anti-influenza vaccines is to increase their safety. That is why, from whole virion vaccines, the transition was made to split vaccines, and from there to subunit vaccines. However, immunogenicity is often reduced with highly purified antigens [
