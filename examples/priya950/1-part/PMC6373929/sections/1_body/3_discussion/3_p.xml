<p>Comparisons between serotypes show that Senegalese 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were more susceptibility to DENV-3 than to other serotypes. Also, DENV-3 was detected in the saliva of all three populations; this could explain recent DENV-3 outbreaks in many African countries (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007043.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The St. Louis population showed transmission potential for all three DENVs even if TRs were low, suggesting a salivary gland barrier within some 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations. However, the population from Dakar showed higher TRs than other populations and at 7 dpbm these rates for DENV-4 reached 20% of total engorged mosquitoes and 7.5% for DENV-3. These transmission rates observed just a week after mosquito infection may explain the Dakar DENV-3 epidemic like the Cape Verde 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> population transmitting during the 2009 outbreak while it showed infection rates of 0% at 7 dpbm and until 10 dpbm the transmission rates did not exceed 20% of only mosquitoes which disseminated the infection [

The potential transmission rates obtained with DENV-4 show that even if a large outbreak has not been reported, the risk of a DENV-4 epidemic is present in Dakar and St. Louis because, as noted before, even with low transmission rates a vector can cause epidemics based on its abundance, density, survival and human feeding frequency [
