<p>Vectorial capacity is the efficiency of a vector in the transmission of a pathogen due to the combined effects of many factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic. The mortality rate is an important component [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007043.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Even if vectors become infected after taking an infectious blood meal, if they fail to survive to bite another host, the potential for transmission by this population is low. As a result, changes in the mosquito mortality rate would directly affect transmission of the pathogen. In our study we found that the exposure of
