<p>An additional passage on C6/36 cells was performed for each strain to obtain the viral stock used to infect mosquitoes. Cell lines were provided by the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va.), and cultured in Gibco DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium), High glucose (Gibco Cat. No. 11965–092) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals Cat. No. S11150) heat-inactivated in 56° C water bath for 60 min, penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco Cat. No. 15140–122) and 10% of Bacto Tryptose Phosphate Broth (Becton, USA). Virus in cell culture supernatants was concentrated using Millipore UFC910024 Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Concentrator with Ultracel 100 Regenerated Cellulose Membrane. Concentrated viruses were collected, aliquoted and frozen at -80°C, and used as viral stocks for mosquito infection. Virus stocks were titrated using the method focus forming assays and immunostaining described below.</p>
