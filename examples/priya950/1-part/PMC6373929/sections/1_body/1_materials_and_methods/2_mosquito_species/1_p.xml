<p>Mosquito species used in this study were collected from three Senegalese localities: Dakar, Saint Louis and Kedougou (

 <italic>aegypti formosus</italic> morphologically characterised by the lack of pales scales on the first abdominal tergite and the urban populations from Dakar and Saint Louis breeding in artificial containers were consistent with

 <italic>aegypti aegypti</italic> contrariwise characterised by the presence of pales scales. These species were chosen based on their abundance, anthrophophilic behavior and association with DENV in nature. For each population, several larval habitats were sampled and immature stages were collected and reared in the laboratory. For

 <italic>luteocephalus</italic> adult females were caught in a gallery forest at Kedougou and reared in the laboratory. Progeny of these populations were considered as the F1 generation that we used for experimental infections. Adult mosquitoes were maintained with a 10% sucrose solution at 27 °C, 75–80% relative humidity (RH), 12:12 h (Light:Dark) photoperiod.
