<p id="Par17">Respiratory tract infections caused by hMPV during adulthood are less prevalent and less serious than those in childhood. However, the presence of hMPV has been detected in 2–4% of adult patients admitted due to a community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and has been associated with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The same as with other common respiratory viruses, hMPV is usually associated with non-severe pneumonia, whereas risk factors like immunosuppression, specific comorbidities—chronic lung disease, heart disease, blood disorders— elderly and living in long-term care facilities are associated with a higher risk of severe viral pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that hMPV infection is an underappreciated cause of critical illness, also in previously healthy patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].
