<p id="Par16">Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a worldwide distributed enveloped virus with a RNA genome closely related to respiratory syncytial virus. hMPV belongs to the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family, in the genus 
 <italic>Metapneumovirus</italic>, first identified in the Netherlands in 2001 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Based on genetic and antigenic variability, hMPV strains have been classified in two groups or lineages (A and B) and four sublineages (A1, A2, B1 and B2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The virus has been reported as a common respiratory pathogen in childhood, associated mainly with upper but also with lower respiratory tract infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. During the annual epidemics, hMPV has been associated with a significant number of hospital admissions in young children [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].
