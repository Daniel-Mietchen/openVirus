<p id="Par31">Two out of three patients of this study had shock at admission, half of them underwent mechanical ventilation, one out of four developed ARDS and one out of seven died during the clinical course, suggesting that hMPV is responsible for SCAP in adults. These data are concordant to that observed in the only study with a wide range of patients with hMPV infection in critically ill patients, in which 55% of the patients required mechanical ventilation, 48% developed ARDS and the mortality was 18% [

In a large prospective study of ICU patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, hMPV was more frequently detected in patients admitted by severe respiratory infection than in patients with other causes, suggesting a causal role of HMPV in the development of severe respiratory infection [
