<p id="Par30">Our study gives new insights on the molecular epidemiology of hMPV pneumonia admitted to the ICU over 10 years. HMPV was consistently detected in CAP admitted to the ICU, with an annual incidence ranging 0.5–1 case/100,000 inhabitants older than 14 years per year. Molecular characterization of hMPV revealed group dominance of subgroup B. HMPV infection presented seasonal distribution, with 2/3 of cases detected in late winter-early spring each year. The 32% of the studied patients were younger than 65 years without comorbidities. HMPV CAP often presented as acute respiratory failure with bilateral opacities and half of ICU subjects underwent mechanical ventilation. Lymphocytopenia and pleural effusion were common at admission. Plasma procalcitonin was a sensitive tool to identify coinfection with bacteria (25%), which contributes to antimicrobial stewardship. These findings suggest the need to implement hMPV diagnosis tests in subjects with CAP developing acute respiratory failure.</p>
