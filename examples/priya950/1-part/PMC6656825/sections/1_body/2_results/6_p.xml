<p id="Par29">The median CRP and procalcitonin plasma levels at ICU admission in the 28 hMPV-infected patients with CAP were 125 [44.6–305.9] mg/L and 1.3 [0.2–9.3] ng/mL, respectively. The values of CRP were similar between patients with bacterial coinfection and those without (median 231.4 [IQR 84.0–407.5] vs 110.2 [38–281.7] mg/L;
