<p id="Par24">During the study period, 1942 respiratory samples were sent from the ICU to the Microbiology Service to study viral etiology, hMPV being identified in 33 patients (1.7%). Studied samples were mainly pharyngeal exudates (77.3%), but also tracheal aspirates (7.5%), bronchoaspirates (5.8%), bronchoalveolar lavages (5.6%) and sputum (4.2%), where bacterial culture was also performed. Five patients with hMPV were excluded because admission causes were other than respiratory infection. Cases were detected every year except in 2008 (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Twenty-six of the 28 patients with respiratory infection due to hMPV (92.9%) were detected during the first half of the year and 16 (57.1%) in March–April. HMPV circulated every year later than influenza virus, being the epidemic peak of both infections separated by a period of 1–2 months. In fact, the 75% of cases (21/28) of hMPV infections in patients admitted to ICU occurred out of the influenza epidemic period (Table
