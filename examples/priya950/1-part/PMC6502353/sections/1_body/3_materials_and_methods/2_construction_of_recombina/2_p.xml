<p>The chimeric viruses were obtained digesting the infectious clones with 
 <italic>SacI</italic> and 
 <italic>NotI</italic> and introducing the products in the alternate lineage. The DNAs of the recombinant constructs were linearized by digestion with 
 <italic>NotI</italic> enzyme and used as templates for transcription by SP6 polymerase in the presence of GpppG cap structure analog, using the mMessage mMachine transcription kit (Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The RNAs were gel-quantified and used for transfection in cell culture.
