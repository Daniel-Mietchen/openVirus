<p>BHK-21 and C6/36 cells seeded into a 24-well plate on a 1 cm
 <sup>2</sup> coverslip were transfected with CHIKV-Cbn, CHIKV-LR, or mutant RNAs, and immunofluorescence assay (IF) was performed at different times post-infection. At each time point cells were fixed in methanol and stained with a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-CHIKV monoclonal antibody CHK-152 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] in PBS to detect viral antigens. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) was used as secondary antibody at 1:1000 dilutions. Estimation of the number of positive cells and calculation of relative percentages of infection was performed with ImageJ, using 5 images for each experimental condition.
