<p>The ability to switch templates has been described for several cellular and viral, DNA and RNA dependent polymerases [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. For plus-strand RNA viruses, RNA recombination was reported more than 50 years ago for poliovirus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and later for aphthoviruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], plant bromoviruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and other members of the alphaviruses genus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Products from RNA recombination are proposed to impact on viral evolution and adaptation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A strong evidence of alphavirus recombination is the emergence of Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), which arose from a recombination event between Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and a Sindbis-like virus. Also, RNA recombination at the 3’UTR of Sindbis virus (SINV) has already been reported, where the 
 <underline>c</underline>onserved 
 <underline>s</underline>equence 
 <underline>e</underline>lement CSE along with the poly (A) tail have been proposed to play a role. Contrarily to our findings with CHIKV, RNA recombination of SINV RNA is not dependent on sequence homology. Instead, cryptic polymerase recognition motifs promote non-homologous template switching between viral and non-viral templates [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It appears that, although stimulated by different RNA determinants, RNA recombination is a founding mechanism that generates diversity at alphaviruses 3’UTR.
