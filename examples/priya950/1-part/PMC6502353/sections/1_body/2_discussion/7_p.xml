<p>Evidence for RNA recombination during natural evolution of CHIKV can be also identified in nature. For instance, the CHIKV-Cbn may have gained its extra DR copy by this molecular mechanism. Overall, this study provides clear evidence that RNA copy-choice recombination between strands from the same or different CHIKV lineages is responsible for genome diversification. In mammalian hosts, new viral variants get rid of redundant DRs; while in mosquito vectors, they might allow CHIKV to overcome “tight” genetic bottlenecks.</p>
