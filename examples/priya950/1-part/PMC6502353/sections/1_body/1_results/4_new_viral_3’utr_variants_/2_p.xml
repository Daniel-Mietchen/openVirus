<p>Unexpectedly, all recombinants contained only the 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I site. We speculate that nucleotide changes introduced to generate the 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I recognition sequence impaired recombination at this site. Furthermore, deletion variants were generated with a frequency of 14% in C6/36 and 49% in BHK (compare to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3</xref>), and they did not carry restriction site marks. We reasoned that they were generated either by dissociation of viral polymerase and re-association at a different position of the original template (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g004">Fig 4A</xref> i) or by template switching between two unmarked RNAs (
