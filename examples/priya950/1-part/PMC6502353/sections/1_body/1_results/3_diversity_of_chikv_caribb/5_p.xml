<p>Contrarily from CHIKV-Cbn, CHIKV-LR bears the simplest 3’UTR found in nature. Then, we asked whether the 3’UTR of this lineage would also lose DR copies during passaging in cell culture. To this end, we similarly analyzed the 3’UTR from CHIKV-LR passaged populations. In contrast to our observations with CHIKV-Cbn, all the cloned fragments corresponded in size to the parental 3'UTR, for viruses grown in either mammalian or mosquito cells (
