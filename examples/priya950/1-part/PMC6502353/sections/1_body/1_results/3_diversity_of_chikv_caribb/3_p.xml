<p>Our results indicate that CHIKV-Cbn 3’UTR is prone to lose DR copies in cell culture. Strikingly, passaging of the virus results in clean deletions of DR copies that arise with higher frequency in BHK cells, suggesting that replication in mammalian cells is the main source of genetic variability at the 3’UTR.</p>
