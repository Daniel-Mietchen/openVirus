<p>Altogether, these experiments show that CHIKV lineages have different potential to generate genetic variability at their 3’UTRs. While the CHIKV-Cbn (bearing multiple copies of DR elements at the 3’UTR) is greatly dynamic during single-host passaging, CHIKV-LR (with fewer copies) is seemingly stable in cell culture.</p>
