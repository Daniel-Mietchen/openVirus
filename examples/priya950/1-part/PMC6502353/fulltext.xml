Chikungunya virus is an important human pathogen transmitted by mosquitoes that, after 60 years of exclusive circulation in Asia and Africa, has rapidly spread in Europe and the Americas. Here, we examined the evolution of CHIKV in different hosts and uncovered host-specific requirements of the CHIKV 3&#x02019;UTR. Sequence repeats are conserved at the CHIKV 3&#x02019;UTR but vary in copy number among viral lineages. We found that these blocks of repeated sequences favor RNA recombination processes through copy-choice mechanism that acts concertedly with viral selection, determining the emergence of new viral variants. Functional analyses using a panel of mutant viruses indicated that opposite selective pressures in mosquito and mammalian cells impose a fitness cost during transmission that is alleviated by recombination guided by sequence repeats. Indeed, drastic changes in the frequency of viral variants with different numbers of repeats were detected during host switch. We propose that RNA recombination accelerates CHIKV adaptability, allowing the virus to overcome genetic bottlenecks within the mosquito host. These studies highlight the role of 3&#x02019;UTR plasticity on CHIKV evolution, providing a new paradigm to explain the significance of sequence repetitions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>An emergent virus is a virus that has adapted to new hosts or environments through changes in its viral genome. Using as model chikungunya virus, which had explosively spread in the Americas and Europe during the last decade, we studied viral adaptability to mosquito and mammalian hosts. Natural isolates from recent outbreaks display highly different 3&#x02019;UTRs, which result in different fitness in mosquito cells. Importantly, drastic changes in viral populations occur when the virus jumps between hosts, with different viral variants being positively and negatively selected according to fitness parameters. Frequent events of RNA recombination, in which the viral polymerase switches templates during RNA synthesis, were observed at the viral 3&#x02019;UTR. RNA recombination explains the high plasticity of this part of the genome and the subsequent emergence of new viral variants that allows the virus to replicate in disparate systems. Our findings support a new model where viral diversity generated by RNA recombination is a potent viral strategy to overcome the fitness barriers imposed during host switching.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Fondo para la Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica (AR)</institution></funding-source><award-id>201-0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0728-5227</contrib-id><name><surname>Filomatori</surname><given-names>Claudia V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>French Government's Investissement</institution></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8593-4117</contrib-id><name><surname>Saleh</surname><given-names>Mar&#x000ed;a Carla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>C.V.F. and D.E.A. are members of the Argentinean Council of Investigation (CONICET).

Rapid adaptation depends on the generation and positive selection of beneficial changes; and relies mainly on two molecular mechanisms: point mutations and genomic recombination [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Point mutations arise from the introduction of nucleotide changes by viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases that lack proofreading activity. In turn, genomic recombination does not produce new changes at the nucleotide level. Instead, the rearrangement of existing genomes creates novel lineages and strains and it has resulted in re-emergence of many RNA viruses.</p><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod borne virus that after 60 years of exclusive circulation in Asia and Africa has recently spread in Europe and America, producing about 1.7 million infections [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Explosive spread of CHIKV has been associated with adaptation of viral lineages to mosquito vector hosts that assured efficient transmission. For instance, the 2007 epidemics in La Reunion Island, which passed to the European continent, have been attributed to adaptive mutations within viral structural glycoproteins that allowed viruses to more readily infect the mosquito <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. On the other hand, CHIKV strains that arrived to the Americas in December 2013 have been spread mainly by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and do not contain this adaptive mutation. Instead, they have acquired nucleotide modifications in the non-structural proteins ORF and sequence duplications at the 3&#x02019;UTR [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>CHIKV is an alphavirus in the Togaviridae family of viruses and contains a non-segmented single stranded RNA genome of 11&#x02013;12 kb, with a type 0 cap at the 5&#x02019; end and a poly (A) tail at the 3&#x02019; end. The 3&#x02019;UTR exhibits large size variations, including extensive substitutions, insertions and deletions, suggesting that it has evolved quickly, probably due to different evolutionary selective pressures. One interesting feature about CHIKV 3&#x02019;UTR is that it contains short sequence repetitions named <italic>direct repeats</italic> (DRs) [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Notably, copy number of DRs varies among ECSA (East, Central, and South African) and Asian lineages, indicating that the 3&#x02019;UTR diverged from a common ancestor that suffered historical events of duplication. Sequences of CHIKV DRs are relatively conserved between closely related lineages, indicating that they have functional significance [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The molecular bases that lead to CHIKV genetic diversity and to viral replacements in nature are not well understood. However, complex host-virus interactions could result in the transmission of only certain variants that exist in the viral population. In this regard, recent studies show that deletion of the repeated sequences reduces viral replication rate in mosquito cells but not in mammalian cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], suggesting that the DRs have host-specific functions. Nevertheless, the host selective pressures that act on these elements and their functional relevance in viral transmission are still poorly understood.</p><p>It is known that arbovirus populations experience important bottlenecks in their mosquito vectors, related to the anatomical barriers the virus has to cross within insects [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Environmental factors, mosquito species and subspecies, and the combinations of viruses and mosquito species affect bottleneck size. In some cases, bottlenecks during natural transmission could constrain genetic diversity of viral populations to levels that lead to fixation of less adapted viruses. So far, how genetic bottlenecks act in concert with host selective pressures to shape the composition of CHIKV populations remains unclear.</p><p>Sequence comparisons of RNA viruses from different groups show that those that must cycle between host species have a more diverse 3&#x02019;UTR than others with a single host [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this regard, we have previously introduced the concept that 3&#x02019;UTR duplications of complex RNA structures provide mosquito-borne flaviviruses with the means to efficiently switch between hosts maintaining high viral fitness [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Here, based on the heterogeneity of the 3&#x02019;UTR of circulating CHIKV, we hypothesized that the number of sequence repetitions can change to accelerate viral adaptation during continuous host cycling. We found that the 3&#x02019;UTR of CHIKV populations is highly dynamic in cell culture and during the infection of laboratory mosquitoes, recapitulating the observations in natural isolates. Genetic diversity of viral populations depends both on CHIKV lineage and the infected host cell, indicating that CHIKV 3&#x02019;UTR is under conflicting selective pressures in mosquito and mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that CHIKV uses genetic recombination at the 3&#x02019;UTR to generate virus populations with diverse 3&#x02019;UTRs. This strategy allows CHIKV to overcome bottlenecks in nature, driving the generation of new viral variants that rapidly replace the existing ones during adaptation to the host. Altogether, our findings provide important insights into the function of CHIKV 3&#x02019;UTR plasticity for host cell adaptation, pointing out a central role of RNA recombination on CHIKV ongoing evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>3&#x02019;UTR heterogeneity of re-emergent natural isolates</title><p>Three major CHIKV lineages have been defined based on their geographic distribution: West African, ECSA, and Asian [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. ECSA and Asian strains have disseminated globally during the last decade, while the West African is confined to a sylvatic circulation in less populated areas of Africa. Interestingly, ECSA and Asian CHIKV lineages differ at their 3&#x02019;UTRs.

In 2005, a CHIKV derived from ECSA lineage expanded the infection in La Reunion Island and then passed to the European continent. More recently, in 2016, a new autochthonous transmission of CHIKV derived from ECSA lineage was described in Brazil and Haiti [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

In contrast, Asian-derived isolates, which arrived to America in 2013, contain longer 3&#x02019;UTRs.

Importantly, CHIKV from different phylogenetic origins and bearing distinct 3&#x02019;UTRs co-circulate in the same countries or nearby areas.

Besides, both linages largely differ at their 3&#x02019;UTRs. To identify sequence repetitions at the 3&#x02019;UTR from these two distinct re-emergent viruses, RNA matrix comparisons were performed. Local alignment plots confirm the presence of multiple DRs at both 3&#x02019;UTRs, but with distinct repetition patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Firstly, we studied the impact of distinct 3&#x02019;UTRs on replication by comparing growth kinetics of CHIKV-LR and CHIKV-Cbn in mammalian (BHK and human fibroblasts) and mosquito cells. Growth curves in mammalian cells showed that both viruses replicated similarly, despite a slight advantage of CHIKV-LR over the CHIKV-Cbn for replication in human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In contrast, CHIKV-Cbn exhibited enhanced growth kinetics in <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36 cells, resulting in 10-fold higher titers compared to CHIKV-LR. To assess the contribution of the 3&#x02019;UTR to the differential behavior in insect cells, we designed chimeras containing the 3&#x02019;UTR from CHIKV-LR in the context of the CHIKV-Cbn genome and vice versa. Equal amounts of RNA transcripts from parental and chimeric viruses were individually transfected into BHK or C6/36 cells. Then, virus replication was monitored by immunofluorescence as a function of time and virus growth curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In BHK cells, similar levels of replication were observed for parental and chimeric viruses of both LR and Cbn lineages, demonstrating that neither the virus backbone nor the 3&#x02019;UTR play lineage specific functions and that the 3&#x02019;UTR may be swapped between viral isolates. On the other hand, in mosquito cells the 3&#x02019;UTR from CHIKV-Cbn provided CHIKV-LR a net advantage for replication, displaying increased percentage of infected cells at two days after transfection and enhanced growth kinetics compared to the parental virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

Unlike the 3&#x02019;UTR of input RNA, the frequency of full-length Cbn 3&#x02019;UTR changed from 100% to 78% and different viral variants with shorter 3&#x02019;UTRs emerged in mosquito cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, middle gel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, upper chart).

Sequencing of 3&#x02019;UTR variants revealed that they contained deletions of DR regions located at different positions of the 3&#x02019;UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, 13 clones for each sample are shown). For instance, in mosquito cell passaged viruses we found a clean deletion of DR(1+2)a in Clone 6 and a deletion of DR3b in Clone 12. In mammalian cells, viral variants with different deletions throughout the 3&#x02019;UTR appeared in the first experiment. In the second experiment, the majority of the variants isolated carried the same deletion, corresponding to one copy of DR3. In addition to deletion variants, a viral variant with an 80-nt insertion emerged in cell culture (clone 5).

Then, we followed the production of infectious particles in both mammalian and mosquito cells. Clone 25, which carried the deletion of DR3a, showed delayed growth kinetics in mosquito cells while it did not affect viral replication in mammalian cells. Instead, Clone 15, which carried the complete deletion of both DR3 copies, was not able to replicate neither in mammalian nor mosquito cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Therefore, it is feasible that this variant represented the non-replicative RNA of a defective interfering particle.

Then, we asked whether the 3&#x02019;UTR of this lineage would also lose DR copies during passaging in cell culture. To this end, we similarly analyzed the 3&#x02019;UTR from CHIKV-LR passaged populations. In contrast to our observations with CHIKV-Cbn, all the cloned fragments corresponded in size to the parental 3'UTR, for viruses grown in either mammalian or mosquito cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism responsible for the generation of these new viral variants. It is accepted that RNA recombination contributes to genetic diversity of many RNA viruses, impacting on their evolution, epidemiology and re-emergence [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. RNA deletions are often generated during RNA recombination by a copy-choice mechanism. This process involves dissociation of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and the nascent strand from the RNA template, and their re-association at a different position of either the original RNA or template switch to a homologous RNA, guided by sequence similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, i and ii, respectively). Template switching from a donor to an acceptor strand generates a chimeric RNA molecule. Given the fact that CHIKV contains various copies of sequence repetitions at its 3&#x02019;UTR, we reasoned that 3&#x02019; variability could be originated by a copy-choice mechanism. To differentiate between re-association on the same or an alternative template molecule, we introduced point mutations into CHIKV-Cbn infectious clone in order to generate recognition sites for two unique restriction enzymes at the boundaries of the 3&#x02019;UTR. Thus, when the RNA marked with the restriction sites is mixed with parental unmarked RNA, recombination between homologous RNAs by template switching will generate a chimeric 3&#x02019;UTR carrying only one of the marker sites. We engineered <italic>Sac</italic>I and <italic>Nhe</italic>I restriction sites at positions 1&#x02013;6 and 858&#x02013;863 after the translation stop codon. The recombinant CHIKV-Cbn <italic>Sac</italic>I<italic>/Nhe</italic>I was infective in both mammalian and mosquito cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). To visualize the presence of <italic>Sac</italic>I and <italic>Nhe</italic>I sites, fragments corresponding to the last 1,500 nucleotides of the viral genome were obtained by PCR and separately digested with the two restriction enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007706.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The fragment amplified from the recombinant virus was sensitive to both <italic>Sac</italic>I and <italic>Nhe</italic>I digestion, and the introduced mutations were stable in cell culture even after 5 successive passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, right panels). Then, to evaluate template-switching events, equal amounts of RNA transcripts for the parental and CHIKV-Cbn <italic>Sac</italic>I<italic>/Nhe</italic>I were co-transfected into cultured cells. At day 3 after transfection, total RNA was extracted from culture media, used as a template for reverse transcription reactions and cloned.

For confirmation, the 3&#x02019;UTRs were also sequenced and relative abundances of viral variants were calculated.

The emergence of these new recombinant variants, that were absent in the input mixture of RNAs, strongly suggests that they were products of a template switching mechanism generated by a polymerase that jumped from a RNA to the same position of a homologous RNA.</p><fig id="ppat.1007706.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007706.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>RNA recombination by switching of viral polymerase between homologous template strands.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of copy-choice recombination mechanisms, where the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (orange oval) and the nascent strand (dashed lines) jump at a different position of the original template (i) or between two homologous templates (ii).

To examine the requirements of DRs for replication in mammalian and mosquito cells we have deleted one, two or three copies of DR (1+2) or one DR3 copy from the CHIKV-Cbn infectious clone [&#x00394;(1+2)a, &#x00394;(1+2)ab, &#x00394;(1+2)abb&#x02019;, &#x00394;3a respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g005">Fig 5A</xref>]. Equal amounts of RNA transcripts for WT and mutant genomes were transfected into cells, and replication was followed by immunofluorescence staining of viral antigens as a function of time. We observed a direct association between the number of DRs and viral replication in mosquito cells. While deletion of one DR(1+2) copy had no effect compared to the WT, deletion of two or three DR(1+2) copies resulted in a moderate and a clear disadvantage for replication in mosquito cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). One day post-transfection, the number of CHIKV positive cells were 33%, 35%, 5% and 0% for WT, &#x00394;(1+2)a, &#x00394;(1+2)ab and &#x00394;(1+2)abb&#x02019;, respectively. By day 4 post-transfection, the complete cell monolayer was infected with all viruses except for &#x00394;(1+2)abb&#x02019;; which only infected 10% of the cells. Because replication of &#x00394;(1+2)abb&#x02019; virus was only evident after 10 days, we asked whether the virus recovered at this time showed any evidence of recombination at the 3&#x02019;UTR. Analysis of clones corresponding to the &#x00394;(1+2)abb&#x02019; population showed that the 3&#x02019;UTR remained stable, suggesting that a minimum of DR copies may be maintained to favor recombination. In agreement with the immunofluorescence results, assessment of virus replication by growth curves showed that &#x00394;(1+2)ab and &#x00394;(1+2)abb&#x02019; exhibited delayed replication kinetics, resulting in 300 and 10,000 fold lower titers as compared to the WT, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Deletion of one DR3 copy was also evaluated in mosquito cells and it was found to delay viral replication, with 10% of the monolayer infected at day 1 and 100-fold reduction in viral titer compared to the WT. Replication of all mutants and WT viruses was similarly investigated in mammalian cells and interestingly, deletion of DR copies had no significant effect on viral fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, bottom panel; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007706.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate a remarkable difference for replication requirements in mosquito and mammalian cells, with an evident positive correlation between the number of DR copies and replication rates in mosquito cells. In addition, DR(1+2) copies cannot compensate for the deletion of DR3, suggesting that DR(1+2) and DR3 copies are functionally different. In fact, DR1 and DR2 do not fold into stable RNA structures. Because DR3 folds into a stable SLY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that this structure plays a role on viral replication in mosquito cells.</p><fig id="ppat.1007706.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007706.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Requirements of DRs for CHIKV-Cbn and CHIKV-LR replication in mosquito and mammalian cells.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Top, schematic representation of the 3&#x02019;UTR corresponding to recombinant CHIKV-Cbn.

We reasoned that host switch by alternate passaging of the virus in mammalian and mosquito cells would impact on the frequency of deletion variants. The CHIKV-Cbn grown in mammalian cells, where 64% of the viruses bear deletions in the 3&#x02019;UTR was used to infect mosquito cells (Host Switch I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

To investigate this possibility, we mixed CHIKV-LR with the chimeric virus containing the 3&#x02019;UTR from CHIKV-Cbn in a 9:1 ratio in order to give a quantitative advantage to the virus with the shorter 3&#x02019;UTR, and grew viral populations in C6/36 cells.</p><p>As expected, adaptation to mosquito cells deeply modified the relative abundance of each virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g007">Fig 7</xref>).

Our experiments reveal that populations of CHIKV are greatly dynamic and the copy number of sequence repetitions at the 3&#x02019;UTR varies continuously when the virus shuttles from mosquito to mammalian cells. Indeed, sequence repetitions act as functional blocks that are gained or lost during cycling to accelerate viral adaptability. Interestingly, duplication of complex RNA structures is a common feature of the 3&#x02019;UTR among other RNA viruses that must cycle between hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, we have only recently obtained experimental insights into the function of duplicated structures for DENV, showing that duplication of a 3&#x02019; structure is beneficial in mammalian cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Here we uncovered the requirements and the underlying mechanism that maintain sequence duplications during CHIKV host cycling. Although there are evidences that support that sequence duplications at the 3&#x02019;UTR provide RNA viruses with the means to replicate in hosts with conflicting demands, our results highlight the differences related to viral biology. We propose a model where RNA recombination and natural selection act concertedly to shape the composition of CHIKV populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g008">Fig 8</xref>). One example is the outcome of CHIKV-Cbn experimental adaptation to mammalian cells (see experiment II in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3</xref>), where the same deletion variant was isolated with high frequency. This can be explained by an early single recombination event followed by positive selection during passaging in cell culture.</p><fig id="ppat.1007706.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007706.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Role of RNA recombination and natural selection on the transmission cycle of CHIKV.</title><p>Schematic representation of CHIKV populations during transmission.

In mammalian cells, deletion variants are generated by RNA recombination and positively selected due to redundancy of DRs. Within mosquitoes, the variants with higher fitness, which are less represented in the population, might not pass through genetic bottlenecks. Under this scenario, RNA recombination might act as an efficient mechanism to generate more competent viral variants that are positively selected rescuing viral replication.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1007706.g008"/></fig><p>RNA recombination is driven by blocks of repeated sequences and is the main mechanism underlying genome plasticity at the 3&#x02019;UTR in both mosquito and mammalian hosts. While positive selection favors the replication of advantageous viral variants, RNA-recombination does not always produce beneficial rearrangements of the viral genome. In fact, RNA recombination yields both viable viruses and non-replicative viral RNAs that are packaged into defective interfering particles [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g008">8B</xref>)]. The Cbn strain missing DR3a and DR3b copies isolated in BHK cells is an example of those non-replicative RNAs. In turn, viable viruses are subjected to positive selection processes in each host, according to specific requirements for viral replication. Direct repeats at the 3&#x02019;UTR are under different host-selective pressures. While they are advantageous for replication in mosquito cells, they are rather redundant in mammalian cells. These conflicting requirements explain why viral variants enriched in DR copies are positively selected in mosquito cells, and then cleared out when the virus switches to mammalian cells. However, the cause for selection of viral variants with disparate 3&#x02019;UTRs in different hosts still remains unclear. In the case of DENV, we discovered that host adaptation modulates the species of non-coding RNAs derived from the 3&#x02019;UTR (known as sfRNA) that are accumulated in infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A number of studies have revealed important functions of sfRNAs, including the evasion of immune responses [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Evidence so far suggests that during CHIKV infection no sfRNAs are produced [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In turn, alphavirus 3&#x02019;UTR in the context of the complete viral genome appears to be the target for antiviral responses in mammalian cells: (i) CHIKV 3&#x02019;UTR is specifically recognized by RIG-I receptors, that sense viral infection to initiate and modulate antiviral immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and (ii) Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) contains at its 3&#x02019;UTR a binding site for a vertebrate-cell specific miRNA that restricts viral replication [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that loss of DR copies at the 3&#x02019;UTR serves as a mechanism to evade host antiviral response in mammalian cells. Future work is required to elucidate whether immune escape is the driving force for CHIKV 3&#x02019;UTR evolution.</p><p>It is well known that the repertoire of viral variants that appear in mammals experience important population bottlenecks when they pass to insect vectors [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Multifactorial circumstances (i.e. vector genetic variations, composition of viral populations, and specific mosquito/virus interactions) could influence the bottleneck size and viral genetic diversity. Following this line of thought, we explain the evolution of CHIKV during host switch under two possible scenarios: &#x0201c;tight&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;wide&#x0201d; genetic bottlenecks. In light of our experiments, we propose that under &#x0201c;wide&#x0201d; genetic bottlenecks the mammalian-adapted population undergoes a purifying selection to remove the variants with lower fitness in mosquitoes. On the other hand, &#x0201c;tight&#x0201d; genetic bottlenecks reduce genetic diversity. Variants with higher fitness in mosquitoes are underrepresented in the mammalian-adapted population and may not go through the bottleneck, posing a constraint to viral replication. In this scenario, RNA recombination can generate new viral variants that are positively selected in mosquitoes, working as an efficient strategy to rescue CHIKV from &#x0201c;tight&#x0201d; genetic bottlenecks or even providing an advantage for viral replication [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g008">Fig 8(C) and 8(D)</xref>].</p><p>Some parallelism can be established between in vitro and in vivo models of CHIKV replication. CHIKV propagates and grows to high titers in mosquito and mammalian cells. In nature, CHIKV quickly disseminates and viral genome reaches up to 10<sup>7</sup>&#x02212;10<sup>9</sup> copies per milliliter of blood or per infected mosquito, as early as 2 days after infection. Comparable effects of 3&#x02019;UTR deletions on CHIKV replication were also observed in C6/36 cells and mosquitoes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g005">5A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g006">6A and Fig 6B</xref>).

Notably, contrarily to deletion of the two DR3 repeats in the Asian lineage (21), we found that a similar deletion in the Caribbean lineage of CHIKV (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) did not produce infectious viruses after transfection into cultured cells, suggesting that some requirements for viral replication might be lineage specific.</p><p>The ability to switch templates has been described for several cellular and viral, DNA and RNA dependent polymerases [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

A strong evidence of alphavirus recombination is the emergence of Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), which arose from a recombination event between Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and a Sindbis-like virus. Also, RNA recombination at the 3&#x02019;UTR of Sindbis virus (SINV) has already been reported, where the <underline>c</underline>onserved <underline>s</underline>equence <underline>e</underline>lement CSE along with the poly (A) tail have been proposed to play a role. Contrarily to our findings with CHIKV, RNA recombination of SINV RNA is not dependent on sequence homology. Instead, cryptic polymerase recognition motifs promote non-homologous template switching between viral and non-viral templates [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It appears that, although stimulated by different RNA determinants, RNA recombination is a founding mechanism that generates diversity at alphaviruses 3&#x02019;UTR.</p><p>For many RNA polymerases, biochemical studies have been performed in order to explore template requirements for homologous RNA recombination, without the bias generated by selection of RNAs that are more competent for replication [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The strength of base pairing regions between the donor and the acceptor RNA strands is believed to modulate genome propensity for this process. In this regard, not all viral variants have the potential to generate diversity through RNA recombination. For instance, previous studies show that CHIKV-La Reunion carrying the deletion of both DR1 and both DR2 copies does not introduce changes at the 3&#x02019;UTR during adaptation. Instead, it acquires compensatory mutations in protein coding regions, so as to improve viral fitness in mosquito cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It seems reasonable that a minimum number of DR copies should be maintained to drive RNA recombination between homologous strands. Here, although bearing certain sequence variations, we have detected recombination events when viruses containing the 3&#x02019;UTR from different CHIKV lineages coexist in the same cell. During outbreaks, coinfections of mosquitoes and patients with different arboviruses have been extensively documented, supporting the notion that simultaneous exposure of mosquitoes to multiple arboviruses during one feeding episode is highly frequent [[<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], for review see [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]]. Given the fact that ECSA and Asian derived lineages co-circulate in the same geographic areas [<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we propose that RNA recombination may occur in mosquitoes that are simultaneously infected with different CHIKV lineages, resulting in the emergence of new viral variants. The ability of viral genomes to recombine within mosquitoes could clearly have implications on CHIKV epidemiology and evolution.</p><p>Evidence for RNA recombination during natural evolution of CHIKV can be also identified in nature. For instance, the CHIKV-Cbn may have gained its extra DR copy by this molecular mechanism. Overall, this study provides clear evidence that RNA copy-choice recombination between strands from the same or different CHIKV lineages is responsible for genome diversification. In mammalian hosts, new viral variants get rid of redundant DRs; while in mosquito vectors, they might allow CHIKV to overcome &#x0201c;tight&#x0201d; genetic bottlenecks.</p><p>Uncovering the mechanisms that govern genetic diversity will certainly contribute to understand the unique potential of CHIKV to adapt to new environments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Sequence alignment, repeated pattern identification and structural analysis</title><p>CHIKV 3&#x02019;UTR sequences were downloaded from GenBank database and aligned using ClustalW2 and MAFFTs programs.
