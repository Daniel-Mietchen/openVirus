<p>The phylogenetic analysis was performed and the strains evaluated in this study were classified as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00690-f004">Figure 4</xref>A. The reconstructed phylogenetic tree from E-6 viruses (VP1 gene) circulating in Brazil from 2013 to 2017 is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00690-f004">Figure 4</xref>B. The Brazilian sequences were grouped into three main clusters and were genetically related to European viruses. In the first and minor clade, the Brazilian MK570390/2013 grouped with an isolate from Nederland (2011), both shared a common ancestor in 2005. The second cluster was mainly composed of Brazilian viruses circulating from 2013 to 2015. In 2010, a divergence event originated two subgroups: One that circulated in 2013 and another in 2014 to 2015, with the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) estimated in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The last cluster (2016–2017) showed a clear phylogenetic relationship with MH361032/2015, an isolate from Great Britain, with the year of divergence estimated as 2014. The co-circulation of viruses belonging to distinct clades was solely observed in 2013. Afterwards, the genetic clade 2014–2015 was replaced by the latest (2016–2017). Our data has proposed an important European role in the introduction of E-6 in Brazil, through multiple events.
