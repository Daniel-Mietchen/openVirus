 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00690-f004">Figure 4</xref>C presents the phylogenetic relationships of E-30 isolated in Brazil, based on the VP1 gene sequences. Two main genetic clades were identified: The first composed of viruses circulating from 2013 to 2015 and the other, included Brazilian isolates from 2017. Within each clade, subclades could be identified within the country, suggesting a higher genetic diversity, when compared to E-6. The first clade shared a common ancestor with Argentinian viruses, dated as 2002. Afterwards, circulation of this viral population was detected earlier in Brazil (2005) and later in Argentina (2011/2012). From 2007, virological surveillance allowed the identification of three subclades. Two out of three included isolates from 2013 to 2015 (BRA/2013/MK570308 and BRA/2013/570315, tMRCA in 2009 and 2011, respectively). Therefore, co-circulation of both variants could be observed in Brazil. The third circulated only in 2014 (BRA/2014/MK570328), with a tMRCA estimated in 2013. The second clade was composed of three subclusters, which diverged in 1999 and co-circulated during 2017. Two out of three were genetically related to North American viruses (USA/2016-MF346639 and USA/2017-MK238243), with tMRCA corresponding to 2015 and 2014, respectively. The third 2017 Brazilian clade was related to viruses previously identified in Argentina and Brazil in 2006 to 2007, with the year of divergence estimated as 2002. Altogether, these findings have suggested that distinct introduction events occurred in 2017, and also highlighting the protagonist of the American countries in this context.
