<p>During the last five years (2013â€“2017), 303 EV isolates were detected based on virus isolation with an EV-positive rate ranging from 5.5% in 2013 (21/381) to 18.2% in 2014 (81/446) and a median throughout of the year of 12% (303/2532) (

Of these, 99.3% (293/295) were EV-B: CV-B1 (2), CV-B2 (1), CV-B3 (6), CV-B4 (3); CV-B5 (27); E-3 (1), E-6 (95), E-7 (16), E-9 (1), E-11 (18), E-13 (1), E-14 (2), E-15 (1), E-18 (11), E-21 (5), E-25 (1), E-30 (102). CV-A9 (1) and EV-71 (1), both belonged to EV-A, which were also detected (

In addition, 71 specimens that generated CPE in cell culture were classified as non-enterovirus based on PCR results.
