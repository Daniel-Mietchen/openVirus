<p>95% of the CSF specimens (2532/2659) with sufficient volume were used to inoculate human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) and human cervix carcinoma (Hep2C) cell lines as previously described (6). Cells were incubated at 37 °C and examined daily regarding the presence of cytopathic effect (CPE). After 7-days (if necessary), the cell cultures were frozen, thawed and re-inoculated and another 7-days examination was performed. Culture supernatants showing CPE were collected and frozen at −70 °C. EV-positive was defined as CPE-positive followed by conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for EV.</p>
