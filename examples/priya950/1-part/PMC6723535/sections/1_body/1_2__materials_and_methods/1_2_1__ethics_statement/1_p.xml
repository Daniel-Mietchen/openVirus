<p>The Enterovirus laboratory at FIOCRUZ is an official Brazilian Ministry of Health Reference Laboratory. The virus isolates utilized in the present study were part of the virus collection of the laboratory. Patients were attended to by the local public health system ambulatories where the clinical samples were collected. This activity was considered to be a public health response to EV surveillance and thus did not require a review by the review board.</p>
