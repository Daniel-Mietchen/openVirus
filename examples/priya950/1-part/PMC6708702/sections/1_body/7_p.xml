<p>Fourteen (52%) of these infections resulted in death. The demographic characteristics were similar for both the death cases and the recovery cases. All reported human A(H7N9) cases were severe and required hospitalization. We found a higher proportion of cases resulted in death for patients who had backyard poultry exposure (71% died 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 46% recovered; Fisher exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.252) or a longer time before receiving anti-viral treatment (6 days died 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 4 days recovered; Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.128). Significantly more of the cases that resulted in death involved patients who had a chronic disease compared with cases that resulted in recovery (57% 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 8%; Fisher exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.013). Underlying chronic conditions were associated with an increased risk of the death (adjusted odds ratio, 15.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.50–156.91).
