<p>There were 9875 environmental surveillance samples from LPMs collected from January to July 2017. Of these, 379 samples (3.84%) were found to be positive for H7 using RNA testing. The rate of positive H7 detection in LPMs varied from 0.09% to 14.29% in different cities [Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>]. We found a steep increase in the number of avian influenza A(H7N9) cases between February 10 and March 21, 2017. Meanwhile, the rate of positive H7 RNA tests in LPMs was higher from 5.20% to 11.82%. There was a positive correlation between the case reports and the H7 detection rate (
