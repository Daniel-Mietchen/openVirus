<p>The increased H7 detection rate in LPMs was strongly associated with the increase in A(H7N9) cases reported. The reported number of human A(H7N9) cases was much higher in Guangdong than in Guangxi. The lower positive rate of H7 detection in Guangxi than in Guangdong may offer a partial explanation. Additionally, asymptomatic patients may have been ignored in Guangxi due to the lack of clinical experience, as all reported cases were severe and resulted in hospitalization. Further study will be required to elucidate the full explanation for this difference.</p>
