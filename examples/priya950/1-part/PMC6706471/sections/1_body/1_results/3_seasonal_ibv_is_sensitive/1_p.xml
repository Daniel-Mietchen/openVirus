<p>Seasonal influenza infections are caused by IAV subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and by IBV (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, in contrast to IAV, the onset and spread of IBV within the community tends to occur primarily in children (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), with an estimated efficiency of transmission in households of &lt;40% by the aerosol route (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). To test the effect of RH on IBV in droplets, a strain from the Victoria lineage was grown in MDCK and HBE cells. This virus replicated to high titers in HBE cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig. S5A</xref>). MDCK cell-grown IBV stability varied with RH, with the greatest average decay (&gt;2 log
 <sub>10</sub>) occurring at 75% RH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Surprisingly, HBE cell-grown IBV also decayed &gt;2 log
 <sub>10</sub> at a midrange RH (55%). No significant difference in log decay was observed between the two propagation methods, suggesting that HBE ASL does not protect IBV from sensitivity to RH. This phenotype was reproduced in two additional HBE cultures derived from distinct patient samples (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig. S5B</xref>). The decay of IBV did not match its resistance to RH in aerosols, which may suggest a role for aerosolization mechanism or droplet size in resistance to RH-dependent decay, although the duration of the incubation for aerosols was half as long as for droplets. The decay of HBE cell-grown IBV was significantly greater (two-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] with Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison test) than that of HBE cell-grown Perth H3N2 at 55% RH. In addition, we did not observe a &gt;2 log
 <sub>10</sub> decay for H1N1pdm or Perth H3N2 viruses grown in HBE cells under any RH condition. These results, as well as our observation that there was not a significant difference in decay between MDCK cell-grown IBV and HBE cell-grown IBV, in contrast to our observations with H1N1pdm, suggest that IAV and IBV isolates may respond differently to RH in droplets. Such differences in vulnerability to RH-medicated decay may be linked to the differential seasonal infection cycles of these viruses in nature.
