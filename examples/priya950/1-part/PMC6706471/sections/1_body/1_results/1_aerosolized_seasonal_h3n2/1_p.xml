<p>Recently, we demonstrated that the presence of airway surface liquid (ASL), collected from HBE cells grown at an air-liquid interface, confers a protective effect against RH-dependent decay to H1N1pdm virus grown in MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells in aerosols and droplets (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These data suggest that HBE ASL provides a protective microenvironment for H1N1pdm. To determine whether this effect is consistent among other seasonal IV, we compared the levels of stability of aerosolized Perth H3N2 and IBV in the presence of HBE ASL.
