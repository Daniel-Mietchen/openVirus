<p>To test the stability of other seasonal IV in aerosols, we aerosolized Perth H3N2 or IBV supplemented with a 1:10 dilution of HBE ASL collected from uninfected cells into a rotating, RH-controlled drum. Changes in infectious virus titer were determined by comparison of TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (50% tissue culture infectious dose) assay results between unaged aerosols and aerosols aged for 1 h in the drum determined on MDCK cells. Log decay was corrected for both physical loss and dilution in the drum at each RH (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref> in the supplemental material). The titer of Perth H3N2 did not change between aged and unaged samples in the presence of HBE ASL, and we did not detect any RH-dependent decay of Perth H3N2 in aerosols after 1 h (
