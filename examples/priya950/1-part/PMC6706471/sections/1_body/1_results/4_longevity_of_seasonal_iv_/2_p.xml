<p>Surprisingly, the Δ log decay of H1N1pdm in droplets was highly variable based on RH condition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Initial average decay at 2 h was determined on the basis of the data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> (H1N1pdm and Perth H3N2) and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref> (IBV). Most strikingly, the infectious titer of HBE cell-propagated H1N1pdm did not diminish at 43% RH, suggesting that the virus was capable of remaining fully infectious in droplets under those conditions for up to 16 h. At 23% and 98% RH, the Δ log decay of H1N1pdm increased from 2 to 16 h. However, at 75% RH, H1N1pdm Δ log decay was different from 2 to 8 h but not 2 to 16 h. We observed a more consistent loss of infectious titer over time for Perth H3N2 and IBV than for H1N1pdm. Specifically, the Δ log decay of Perth H3N2 increased significantly between 2 and 16 h under all four RH conditions tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Similarly, Δ log decay of HBE cell-grown IBV also increased significantly from 2 to 16 h under all four RH conditions tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Mixed-effects analyses using Tukey’s multiple-comparison test confirmed that Δ log decay of H1N1pdm was significantly different from that of both Perth H3N2 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and IBV (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) at 43% RH as well as from that of IBV (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) at 75% RH. Δ log decay of Perth H3N2 was significantly different from that of IBV (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) at 75% by the same statistical analysis.
