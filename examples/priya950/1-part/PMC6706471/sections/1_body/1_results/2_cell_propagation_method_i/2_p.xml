<p>To examine whether H1N1pdm decay was representative of that of other human H1N1 viruses, we assessed the decay of a pre-2009 pandemic seasonal H1N1 (Bris H1N1) strain (

Similarly to the results seen with H1N1pdm, we found that the levels of stability of BrisH1N1 were statistically significantly different between MDCK and HBE cells at 43%, 55%, and 75% RH. These data indicate that sensitivity of H1N1 viruses to RH in the absence of HBE ASL is not limited to viruses emerging after the 2009 pandemic. In contrast, analysis of the stability of Perth H3N2 IV in stationary droplets showed that the levels were not significantly different in comparisons between cell propagation methods at all RH settings, excluding 98%, where HBE-grown H3N2 decayed more than MDCK-grown H3N2 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>). In both cases, Perth H3N2 showed a trend toward more decay at midrange RH (43% to 75%) than at low or high RH. Our data suggest that viral propagation method impacts the stability of H1N1 viruses more than H3N2 viruses, at least for those isolates analyzed in this study, indicating that IV do not all respond to environmental stimuli in the same manner.
