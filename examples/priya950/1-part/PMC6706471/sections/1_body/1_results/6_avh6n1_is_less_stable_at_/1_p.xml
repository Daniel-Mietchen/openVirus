<p>In comparing the data from the different isolates tested in this study, we noticed that avH6N1 appeared to be highly sensitive to RH, reaching average decay levels above 3 log
 <sub>10</sub> at 55% RH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). To assess whether this virus decayed differently from the other viruses tested, we compared the levels of decay under each set of RH conditions for HBE cell-grown avH6N1 with H1N1pdm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>), Perth H3N2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>), and IBV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>) as well as with the other LPAI virus, avH9N2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D</xref>). We detected significantly more decay of avH6N1 than of each of the human-pathogenic seasonal IV for at least 1 midrange RH condition. In contrast, decay of avH6N1 was not significantly different from decay of avH9N2 under any RH condition, suggesting that this LPAI isolate may be less resistant to RH-dependent decay than the highly transmissible human-pathogenic seasonal viruses. Human and avian IV generally differ in hemagglutinin (HA) receptor specificity, with human IV preferentially binding to α2,6-linked sialic acids and avian IV preferring α2,3 sialic acids (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). To test whether receptor specificity impacts virus stability at midrange RH, we compared the decay of wild-type H1N1pdm with that of a mutant H1N1pdm having preferential binding to α2,3-linked sialic acids (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS8">Fig. S8</xref>) that we had previously characterized (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). We found significantly more decay of the α2,3 HA H1N1pdm mutant under 43% RH conditions than of the wild-type viruses. This result was confirmed in three independent HBE cultures, indicating that viral persistence may be influenced, at least in part, by HA receptor binding preference.
