<p>In this study, we examined the environmental persistence of six IV, including human-pathogenic seasonal and LPAI viruses (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> in the supplemental material), in response to a range of RH conditions. We explored the contributions of virus strain background, droplet composition via various propagation methods, RH, and duration of exposure on the stability of IV in aerosols and large droplets. We found that human-pathogenic seasonal H3N2 and IBV were resistant to decay under most RH conditions for an extended period of time in aerosols containing ASL from HBE cells (HBE ASL). However, the longevities of human-pathogenic seasonal IV stability in droplets differed between subtypes H1N1, H3N2, and IBV in an RH-dependent manner, suggesting a role for virus-specific factors in the environmental persistence of IV. Surprisingly, we observed that LPAI IV were more vulnerable to decay at midrange RH than human-pathogenic seasonal IV. Together, these results confirm that human-pathogenic seasonal IV can remain infectious under a range of RH conditions, in agreement with our previous study (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), but this work clearly demonstrates that RH may be an important factor affecting the stability of expelled IV over time. Overall, our results indicate that the levels of persistence of IV are not uniform and that virus-specific factors can impact the stability and longevity of IV in the environment.
