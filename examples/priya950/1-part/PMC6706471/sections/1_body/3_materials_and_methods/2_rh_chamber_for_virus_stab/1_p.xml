<p>Virus-laden droplets were exposed to seven RH conditions (23%, 33%, 43%, 55%, 75%, 85%, and 98%) in chambers conditioned for each RH using aqueous saturated salt solutions as previously described (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Briefly, chambers were housed inside a biosafety cabinet at room temperature, and temperature and RH were recorded during all experiments using an Onset HOBO temperature/RH logger. Ten 1-μl droplets were incubated in a 12-well tissue culture plate for the indicated time under each set of conditions. Residual virus was collected in 500 μl of L-15 tissue culture medium. Control samples consisting of 10 μl of virus suspension in an enclosed tube were incubated at ambient temperature within the same biosafety cabinet as the chamber during each experiment. The change in virus infectivity in response to RH is represented as log decay compared to the titer of control samples, as previously described (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The rate of virus decay over time was quantified as Δ log decay, normalized to the average decay of each virus measured after 2 h under each set of RH conditions, where 
 <italic>x</italic> is the indicated duration of incubation and 
 <italic>n</italic> is the number of replicate samples collected at 2 h for each virus at each RH, as follows:
