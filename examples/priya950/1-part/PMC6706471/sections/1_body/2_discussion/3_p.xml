<p>Among the IV exposed to a range of RH conditions in stationary droplets, all viruses responded to RH with generally more stability at low and high RH and the most decay under midrange conditions. However, the degrees of decay at midrange RH differed among the strains. Previous studies exploring the levels of stability of IAV and IBV smeared onto plastic (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and banknotes (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) indicated that IAV tend to be more stable than IBV at midrange RH, but variations in ambient RH, virus suspension medium, mode of surface deposition, and surface material make direct comparisons difficult. In our study, virus strain and propagation method affected the degree to which each virus decayed under these conditions. Growth in HBE cells protected pre- and post-2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses from decay at midrange RH (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref> in the supplemental material). In contrast, we found that HBE cell-grown Perth H3N2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>) and IBV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) decayed similarly to their MDCK cell-grown counterparts, although IBV may be more sensitive to RH than the seasonal IAV tested here. Much less is known about transmission of IBV than about that of IAV, although its spread may be driven primarily by children through direct contact (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). A recent study identified a correlation between IAV transmission efficiency and persistence of aerosolized virus infectivity in a ferret model (
