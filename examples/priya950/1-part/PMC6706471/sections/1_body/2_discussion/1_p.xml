<p>With this work, we have produced a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between RH and the stability of seasonal IV and LPAI in the environment. We found that stability of airborne IV in aerosols and droplets is not unique to H1N1pdm as previously reported (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) but is a trait shared by other seasonal IV isolates representative of currently circulating epidemic viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, a discord remains between these findings and historical evidence that suggests that the stability of IV in the environment can be influenced by RH (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We now provide a more refined explanation of the relationship between IV stability and RH that considers other factors, including virus strain background and time. We found that RH-mediated decay of seasonal IV varies with virus strain and propagation method, suggesting a role for virus- and host-specific factors in the maintenance of stability in the environment. To lend further support to this model, we have also found that the persistence of infectious virus in droplets over extended periods of time varies with RH and virus strain background.
