<p>We have shown that, similarly to the RH sensitivity results, the persistence of infectious IV over time varied with virus strain background and with RH. For example, the rate of decay of H1N1pdm in droplets did not increase for up to 16 h after deposition at midrange RH, while both Perth H3N2 and IBV continued to decay over time under all RH conditions tested (

Previous work showed that MDCK cell-grown H3N2 viruses can remain stable for up to 2 days following inoculation of a banknote, with persistence extended to days (IBV) or weeks (H3N2) under conditions of supplementation with human nasopharyngeal secretions (

However, we have also shown that this persistence is closely linked to both atmospheric conditions and virus strain. The impact of other factors, such as deposition surface material, will also need to be considered in future studies of viruses in physiological droplets.
