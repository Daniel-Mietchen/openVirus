<p>Among seasonal IV, we identified differences between isolates of IBV and H3N2. Both viruses were stable in fine aerosols (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), but IBV decayed significantly more than H3N2 in stationary droplets at 55% RH based on our statistical tests. Important distinctions between these two experiments are that (i) IV aerosolized into the drum were supplemented with ASL from HBE cells rather than being grown in HBE cells and that (ii) the viral aerosols were exposed to each RH for only 1 h in the rotating drum. These results, together with data from our previously published work (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), indicate that seasonal IV have the potential to remain highly stable and infectious while suspended in the atmosphere and also that aerosol or droplet size may be an important determinant of viral stability in the environment.
