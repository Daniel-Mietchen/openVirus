 <p>A mutant H1N1pdm virus with a preference for binding avian cell surface receptors is less stable than wild-type H1N1pdm. α2,3 H1N1pdm was grown in three primary HBE cell lines. Combined droplet decay levels of wild-type H1N1pdm grown in three HBE cell lines were compared to the level of decay seen with the mutant virus grown in three HBE cell lines. Decay of virus from each individual cell line was determined from experiments conducted in triplicate. Significantly more decay of α2,3 H1N1pdm was detected under 43% RH conditions by two-way ANOVA, and adjusted
