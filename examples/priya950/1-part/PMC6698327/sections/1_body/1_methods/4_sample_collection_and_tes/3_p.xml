<p id="Par36">Human NP/OP samples were tested for viral RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using CDC primers and probes for influenza A and influenza B viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The RNA was extracted using the QIAamp RNA extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cutoff for positivity was read at cycle threshold (C
 <sub>T</sub>) values ≤ 40. Positive and negative controls were used to validate the test assay.
