<p id="Par40">Crude risk ratios were determined for the initial assessment of the association between pig exposure and episodes of ARI. We applied the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) using the Poisson distribution to adjust the risk ratio between pig exposure and ARI for clustering and potential confounding. We assessed for overdispersion before applying the Poisson distribution where a 
 <italic>p</italic> value of &lt; 0.05 would indicate overdispersion. The predictor variables (fixed effects) included in GLMM to predict the occurrence of ARI episodes were pig workers, age, sex, occupation, education level completed, reported chronic disease, and poultry exposure. We accounted for clustering at household and individual level (repeat ARI episodes) by including the variables as random effects in the mixed model. The GLMM was done using the lme4 package in R statistical software where the estimation is based on the maximum likelihood [
