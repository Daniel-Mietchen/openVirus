<p id="Par64">Our finding of 3% influenza positive ARI human cases is lower than a community study in Romania that reported 13% influenza A virus positive samples among ARI cases by PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The low number of PCR positives among ARI cases could be due to sampling a healthy population who did not have active infection at the time of sampling or had a subclinical infection. The follow-up time per participant was about 3 months and seasonality of influenza could account for the relatively low number of positive cases.
