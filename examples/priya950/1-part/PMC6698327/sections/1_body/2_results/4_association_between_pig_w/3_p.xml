<p id="Par53">A Poisson generalized linear mixed model was used to adjust the RR for potential confounding against age, sex, poultry exposure, education, month of sampling, occupation, and reported chronic disease. The adjusted RR for pig workers was 0.56 (95% CI [0.33, 0.93]), indicating that pig workers had a 44% lower risk of having ARI compared to non-pig workers (Table
