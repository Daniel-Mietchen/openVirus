Since transmission of these viruses between humans and pigs can be associated with occupational and environmental exposures, we investigated the association between occupational exposure to pigs, occurrence of acute respiratory illness (ARI), and influenza A virus infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study was conducted in Kiambu County, the county with the highest level of intensive small-scale pig farming in Kenya. Up to 3 participants (&#x0003e; 2 years old) per household from pig-keeping and non-pig-keeping households were randomly recruited and followed up in 2013 (Sept-Dec) and 2014 (Apr-Aug). Oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected from participants with ARI at the time of study visit. For the animal study, nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, and serum samples were collected from pigs and poultry present in enrolled households. The human and animal swab samples were tested for viral nucleic acid by RT-PCR and sera by ELISA for antibodies. A Poisson generalized linear mixed-effects model was developed to assess the association between pig exposure and occurrence of ARI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Of 1137 human participants enrolled, 625 (55%) completed follow-up visits including 172 (27.5%) pig workers and 453 (72.5%) non-pig workers. Of 130 human NP/OP swabs tested, four (3.1%) were positive for influenza A virus, one pig worker, and three among non-pig workers. Whereas none of the 4462 swabs collected from pig and poultry tested positive for influenza A virus by RT-PCR, 265 of 4273 (6.2%) of the sera tested positive for virus antibodies by ELISA, including 11.6% (230/1990) of the pigs and 1.5% (35/2,283) of poultry. The cumulative incidence of ARI was 16.9% among pig workers and 26.9% among the non-pig workers. The adjusted risk ratio for the association between being a pig worker and experiencing an episode of ARI was 0.56 (95% CI [0.33, 0.93]), after adjusting for potential confounders.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Our findings demonstrate moderate seropositivity for influenza A virus among pigs, suggesting the circulation of swine influenza virus and a potential for interspecies transmission.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acute respiratory illness</kwd><kwd>Influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>Pig workers</kwd><kwd>Zoonoses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHSN266200700007C</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006090</institution-id><institution>Center for Global Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Njenga</surname><given-names>Kariuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par17">Influenza A viruses pose a significant risk to human health because of their wide host range (swine, birds, horses, dogs, cats, sea mammals) and capacity to reassort into novel viruses that can cause serious epidemics or pandemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Pigs are believed to play an important part in the evolution of viruses of pandemic potential because of their inherent ability to allow replication of swine, avian, and human influenza viruses and potential to have mixed infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For example, the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic virus that was associated with 150,000&#x02013;570,000 deaths globally was the product of re-assortment of circulating human influenza and avian influenza strains with pigs suspected as the mixing vessel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Pig-to-human and human-to-pig influenza (reverse zoonosis) virus transmission events have been documented in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Reverse zoonosis of influenza virus is considered an important source of swine influenza virus (SIV) diversity which reduces the efficacy of vaccines to SIV in pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The transmission of influenza viruses between pigs and humans is not only associated with occupational and environmental exposures, but also with the virus evolution and emergence of novel transmissible strains capable of infecting humans and spreading from person to person that can lead to pandemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Studies have shown evidence of infection with newly emerging SIVs as well as higher prevalence of SIVs among persons whose occupation involves close contact with pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Findings from a preliminary study in pigs from a Kenyan slaughterhouse revealed an overall influenza A seroprevalence of 15%, including &#x0003e; 12% seroprevalence of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, suggesting transmission of influenza viruses from humans to pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The growing demand for pig products in Kenya has resulted in rapid growth in intensive small-scale pig farming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although pig workers in such livestock production systems may be exposed to swine influenza viruses, no studies on the occupational exposure risks to influenza viruses have been documented in the country.</p><p id="Par22">Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to determine the association between occupational exposure to pigs and the occurrence of ARI and influenza A virus infection. We monitored ARI among the humans to determine its utility in detection of influenza virus infections among pig workers.

Among households which practised quarantine&#x000a0;for new pigs, about half (52.5%) quarantined for 3 days or less. Almost three-quarters of the pig-keeping households did not vaccinate their pigs for any disease, and none of the households reported vaccinating the pigs against influenza. A quarter of the households reported that the pigs regularly mixed with other animals on their farm (or animals in other farms).</p><p id="Par59">Overall, there was low usage of personal protective equipment by pig workers, with 96.3% using eye protection less than once a week and less than half (45.7%) using protective coveralls and aprons when working in pig pens.</p><p id="Par60">However, 72.2% used footwear most of the time (&#x0003e; 5 times a week) and nearly all (96.9%) reported washing hands after working in the barns</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par61">This study documents a human-animal environment in Kiambu County with robust influenza virus circulation, demonstrated by &#x0003e; 6% seropositivity of the virus among the pig and poultry populations including almost 12% in the pig population.</p><p id="Par62">Similarly, we found 3% of humans with acute respiratory illness positive for influenza A virus by RT-PCR. These findings agree with other studies, including a Kenyan study that reported 15% influenza virus prevalence among pigs and other studies elsewhere in Africa and Asia reporting as high as 67% influenza virus seroprevalence among swine in live markets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">Since swine influenza vaccination was not practiced by the farmers in our study, the level of seropositivity suggests exposure to circulating virus. The 1.4&#x02013;3.3% prevalence of influenza virus among the poultry species (chicken, ducks, and geese) reported in our study support the finding that Kiambu County is an environment of animal influenza virus circulation.</p><p id="Par64">Our finding of 3% influenza positive ARI human cases is lower than a community study in Romania that reported 13% influenza A virus positive samples among ARI cases by PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The low number of PCR positives among ARI cases could be due to sampling a healthy population who did not have active infection at the time of sampling or had a subclinical infection. The follow-up time per participant was about 3 months and seasonality of influenza could account for the relatively low number of positive cases.</p><p id="Par65">We found that pig workers had about half the risk of having ARI compared to non-pig workers. This could be due to healthy worker effect where persons who work closely with pigs have systematic differences associated with occurrence of ARI compared to the non-pig exposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">For example, pig workers had a lower proportion of &#x0003c; 20-year-olds compared to non-pig workers (9% vs 19%, respectively). Our study finding is contrary to other studies that showed pig workers have higher odds of respiratory illness compared to non-pig workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, these were cross-sectional studies conducted in high-income countries to assess chronic respiratory health among farmers. It is likely that serology results from our study would have been higher in pig workers, or at least comparable with those of non-pig workers. However, attempts to carry out serology in humans were unsuccessful.</p><p id="Par67">Our finding of lower risk of ARI among pig workers suggest that monitoring ARI in the general population would likely miss potential zoonotic events. Zoonotic influenza events are likely to first appear among those working or exposed to pigs or poultry, mostly young adults. With the reported levels of exposure to swine influenza among pigs in our study, including the pig workers in the influenza surveillance could enhance efforts to detect early zoonotic influenza events.</p><p id="Par68">Focused surveillance in an occupationally exposed group offers a potentially cost-effective mechanism to monitor trends of influenza, including influenza zoonotic events. A number of innovative and affordable approaches such as mobile-based surveillance could be applied to offer the needed early warning mechanism to identify increases in acute or severe respiratory episodes in this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">In the mixed-effects model for occurrence of ARI, having a household member with an episode of ARI in the previous 3 months was an independent risk factor. These findings are consistent with the known transmission of pathogens associated with ARI through close contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par70">When we assessed the farming practices associated with increased transmission of zoonotic influenza, we found that pig-keeping households also kept poultry (mixed animal farming), and majority did not quarantine newly introduced pigs before mixing with the herd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, there was inadequate use of personal protective equipment while working in pig pens. Studies have documented that lack of quarantine and uncontrolled movement between farms, and poor usage of personal protective equipment are risk factors for influenza transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These transmission-promoting practices could be due to the lack of knowledge and facilities for biosecurity measures.</p><p id="Par71">This study had several limitations. We had a loss to follow-up of 45% of the enrolled participants. While there were no differences in age or education level between those lost to follow-up and those retained, they could have had different experiences on ARI, influenza A positivity and farming practices.</p><p id="Par72">Although the study period included 9 months of the year, follow-up period for each participant was about 3 months. It is also likely that not all ARI episodes were reported due to participant recall bias. A longer and more frequent follow-up and with serological testing would allow for sampling to account for seasonality of influenza infections as well as subclinical cases. Another limitation is that we were not able to conduct hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests to determine the influenza A virus strains circulating among pigs. However, a study in Kenya in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] reported 72% of seropositive pigs had influenza virus (A/H1N1/pdm09) by HI, findings that could reflect the influenza virus strains among pigs in our study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par73">Our study documents moderate seropositivity among pigs for influenza A virus, suggesting circulation of swine influenza virus and therefore a potential for interspecies transmission. Swine workers had a lower risk of ARI compared to non-swine workers. While serological studies among swine workers may be a better approach to quantify the risk of zoonotic influenza infection, focused syndromic surveillance in this population offers an important early warning system for such zoonotic events in Kenya.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ARI</term><def><p id="Par5">Acute respiratory illness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p id="Par6">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par7">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELISA</term><def><p id="Par8">Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLMM</term><def><p id="Par9">Generalized linear mixed model</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KEMRI</term><def><p id="Par10">Kenya Medical Research Institute</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NP</term><def><p id="Par11">Nasopharyngeal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OP</term><def><p id="Par12">Oropharyngeal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT-PCR</term><def><p id="Par13">Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par14">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SIV</term><def><p id="Par15">Swine influenza viruses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VTM</term><def><p id="Par16">Virus transport media</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, and Fisheries; the County Government of Kiambu; and Kenya Medical Research Institute for their participation in the implementation of the study.
