<p>The two main competent vectors of CHIKV are considered to be 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, although the virus has been isolated from other mosquitoes [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes thrive in tropical and arid areas but cannot withstand cool temperatures. These mosquitoes were responsible for all the recorded CHIKV epidemics until the Indian Ocean Islands epidemic in 2005–2006 when a point mutation occurred in the outer membrane E1 glycoprotein of CHIKV, causing an amino acid change with an Alanine to Valine substitution at position 226 [

 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes are highly invasive and have successfully established populations in temperate climates [
