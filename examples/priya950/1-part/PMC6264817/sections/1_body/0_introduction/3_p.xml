<p>CHIKV is maintained in a sylvatic cycle involving wild primates and arboreal mosquitoes in Africa, and a mosquito to (and from) human urban cycle in countries with human epidemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The urban cycle of CHIKV has been responsible for several large CHIKV epidemics in countries spanning many continents. During the 2005–2006 epidemics in the Indian Ocean Islands and India, more than a third of the population in Reunion Island were infected with CHIKV (34.3%) resulting in many severe clinical cases, while case-fatality rates of 4.5% and 4.9% were reported in Mauritius and India respectively [
