<p>Several studies described atypical and severe forms of chikungunya disease during both acute and convalescent phases, as well as chronic morbidities associated with CHIKV infection. Many articles from India reporting on epidemics from 2006 onwards frequently describe hyperpigmentation as an atypical observation during and after the infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref297" ref-type="bibr">297</xref>]. A study from Venezuela described unexpected nasal skin necrosis in a few patients with severe chikungunya disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref298" ref-type="bibr">298</xref>]. It remains unclear whether this atypical sign is linked to a particular mutation in the virus or to host genetics. Interestingly, observations from our results show that hyperpigmentation is always reported in individuals with darker skin. In addition to hyperpigmentation, we observed several reports of severe ocular disease associated with chikungunya, ranging from varied forms of uveitis and other manifestations, to complete blindness [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref300" ref-type="bibr">300</xref>]. Five studies described acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in CHIKV patients from India [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref304" ref-type="bibr">304</xref>]. It remains to be determined if any pre-existing morbidity is associated with these outcomes. Other neurological complications were infrequently observed across early chikungunya outbreaks, however, Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a relatively new complication associated with CHIKV infection reported in the literature since the Indian Ocean Island epidemics of CHIKV [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref306" ref-type="bibr">306</xref>]. A study on a chikungunya epidemic in French Polynesia reported an increase in the number of GBS cases [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref233" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. These observations may be a result of larger epidemics with better reporting, or due to newly acquired genomic changes that contribute to higher virulence in the virus. ZIKV which often co-circulates with CHIKV has also been reported to be associated with GBS [
