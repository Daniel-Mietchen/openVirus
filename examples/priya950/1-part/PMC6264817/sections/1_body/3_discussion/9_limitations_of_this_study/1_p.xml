<p>This ScR was conducted by using rigorous and reproducible synthesis research methodology, however, it is possible that some articles were not identified by our search or search verification strategy. Excluding articles that were not in English, French, Spanish or Portuguese could contribute to potential language bias and may have resulted in an underrepresentation of some geographic regions in our results. The impact of these exclusions is unknown. The lapse in time between the updated search and the completion of the analysis for this study has certainly resulted in our inability to capture information from many recently published papers and is a limitation of our study. However, we believe that this limitation is offset by the rigour and thoroughness of our methodology and the included literature adequately represents affected areas around the world. We presume that the impact of missing research is minimal. The articles used for data extraction and the dataset generated from this project mailto:are available in the DRYAD digital repository and can be accessed using the review link: DOI:
