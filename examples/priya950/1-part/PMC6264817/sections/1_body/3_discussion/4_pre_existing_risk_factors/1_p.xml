<p>Although chikungunya is a self-limiting disease, it can result in long term sequelae, most often resulting in chronic arthritis. Researchers have postulated that pre-existing morbidities can predispose an individual to more severe chikungunya disease and chronic sequelae post-CHIKV infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref294" ref-type="bibr">294</xref>]. The list of pre-existing morbidities in CHIKV patients compiled from the literature can broadly be categorized as chronic respiratory, cardiovascular, immunological disorders, and Type 2 Diabetes. Further analysis of the literature on the relationship between pre-existing morbidities and the development of chronic sequelae could be explored in a systematic review to summarize the magnitude and confidence in any potential association that might exist.
