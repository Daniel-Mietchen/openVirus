<p>The risk of viremic travelers importing CHIKV into non-endemic regions with competent vectors is quite high, as highlighted by locally transmitted epidemics in France [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref231" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>]; Italy [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In non-endemic areas where CHIKV vectors are present, it is important for public health authorities and physicians to be aware of chikungunya disease and the possible epidemic risks associated with the importation of the virus into new areas through viremic travelers. Large epidemics are costly but can be controlled with proper prevention and control strategies such as personal protection against vectors and vector mitigation.
