<p>In conclusion, this ScR identified and characterized all available literature on CHIKV and allowed us to capture important information from the many epidemic waves observed with CHIKV infection over time. We have reported important observations relating to trends in disease manifestation, long term sequelae associated with CHIKV infection, plasticity of the viral genome, important epidemiological characteristics, as well as characteristics of surveillance and monitoring programs typically used. In addition, our results describe the extent of research on treatment strategies, mitigation methods for preventing or controlling CHIKV disease and/or CHIKV vectors. Global evidence on treating and preventing CHIKV can be used to inform future public health initiatives. The ScR repository also includes a comprehensive list of research on important mutations that are potentially linked to evolution, adaptation and fitness of the virus. Within these results, knowledge gaps and areas with abundant research were noted. In-depth knowledge synthesis projects and a risk assessment project have used data generated from this ScR as inputs [
