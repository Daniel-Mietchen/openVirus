<p>A ScR protocol was created 
 <italic>a priori</italic> to ensure transparency, reproducibility and consistency during all stages of our review; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207554.s002">S1 Protocol</xref>. We followed the general framework outlined by Arksey and O’Malley [
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] which included: 1) establishing a research question, 2) conducting a stringent literature search, 3) relevance screening of captured articles, 4) characterizing all relevant articles, and 5) collating and summarizing results from extracted data. This ScR was designed and executed to be reproducible by employing good synthesis research practices, which included a complete search strategy. Screening and data characterization tools were developed 
 <italic>a priori</italic> and uniformly implemented on all citations and articles included in the review by two independent reviewers [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The reporting of this ScR is aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [
