<p>Articles included in this ScR reported primary data that were generated by the authors, or through reliable government and/or research organizations. Included articles had to be relevant to one or more aspects of the review question: i.e., information on CHIKV and chikungunya disease, competence parameters of CHIKV vectors, or control of CHIKV vectors. Articles in languages other than English, French, Spanish or Portuguese were excluded due to limited translation resources. Documents without primary data, such as whole conference proceedings, books, literature reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and some types of grey literature were also excluded from the review.</p>
