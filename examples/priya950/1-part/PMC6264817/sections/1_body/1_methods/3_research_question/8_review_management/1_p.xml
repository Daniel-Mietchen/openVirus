<p>All citations captured using the search algorithm were imported from the bibliographic databases to RefWorks (ProQuest, LLC), an online citation management program. The citation database was de-duplicated so that only unique citations remained. The citations were then imported into an online systematic review software, Distiller SR (Evidence Partners, Ottawa, Canada), which is specifically designed to manage all aspects of scoping reviews. All stages of the ScR were conducted by two reviewers working independently using the 
 <italic>a priori</italic> developed data collection tools within Distiller SR. All forms were pre-tested by all reviewers to confirm reproducibility, clarity and consistency between reviewers on each form. Reviewers pre-tested the Relevance Screening Level 1 (RS1) form with 36 citations, the Relevance Screening Level 2 (RS2) form was pre-tested with ten articles and the Data Extraction and Utility (DCU) form was pre-tested on ten articles representing all the main focus areas of the review question, (kappa &gt;0.8); 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207554.s002">S1 Protocol</xref>. After pre-testing, any necessary adjustments were made to the forms to improve clarity and consistency between reviewers. Any discrepancies on extracted data between reviewers were resolved by consensus, or with the help of a third reviewer. The completed dataset was exported into Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, categorization, descriptive analysis and charting.
