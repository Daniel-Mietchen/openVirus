 <bold>Behavioral protective measures:</bold> The 79/323 articles on personal protective measures included using insect repellant (38 articles), wearing full coverage clothing that prevents mosquito access to skin while outdoors (8 articles), using mosquito bed nets and window screens (36 articles), avoiding practices that lead to collecting stagnant water and removing suitable vector habitats, such as emptying pots, containers or tires (64 articles). The use of many of the protective interventions were evaluated before and/or after an education program to teach the general public or targeted population group about CHIKV (12 articles), personal and/or behavioral protective measures (7 articles), insecticides (5 articles) or all three aforementioned categories of measures (22 articles). Study designs varied from quasi-experiments and cross-sectional studies to predictive models of the various protective measures. Few articles report data on the effectiveness of personal protection interventions (38/79, 48%).
