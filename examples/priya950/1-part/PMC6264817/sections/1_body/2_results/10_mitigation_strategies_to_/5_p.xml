 <bold>Biological control strategies:</bold> There were 51/323 (16%) articles describing biologic control of vectors as a mitigation strategy against CHIKV. Of these, 7/51 (14%) reported on Sterile Insect Technology (SIT), 14/51 (27%) were on Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT or Cytoplasmic incompatibility) and 2/51 (2%) articles described Release of Insects with Dominant Lethal mosquitoes (RIDL) as an effective strategy to mitigate CHIKV transmission through vectors. Infection of mosquito vectors with bacteria for controlling or reducing CHIKV replication was reported in 23/51 (45%) studies, with 12/51 (24%) studies examining the efficacy of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and 11/51 (22%) investigating the role of 
 <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> for effective control of CHIKV transmission through CHIKV carrying vectors. One study investigated silver particles synthesized by the fungus 
 <italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic> as a potential nanolarvicide against 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> larvae and found this to be a very effective strategy for killing the larvae [
