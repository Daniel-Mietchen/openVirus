<p>The potential contribution of non-human vertebrate hosts towards sylvatic transmission of CHIKV was investigated in 12 observational studies (
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with 11/12 (92%) articles on NHPs, 3/12 (25%) on domestic and farm animals, 1/12 (8%) on wild birds, and 4/12 (33%) on non-primate wild animals and reptiles. Sylvatic transmission has only been reported in Africa where early studies implicated primates, rodents and bats as possible sylvatic hosts;
