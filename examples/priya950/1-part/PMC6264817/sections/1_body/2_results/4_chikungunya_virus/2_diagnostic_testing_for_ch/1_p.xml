<p>Data were captured from three types of testing for CHIKV, predominantly in humans (687/2326; 30%), to: 1) diagnose active CHIKV infection in patients, 2) screen sample populations of hosts for antibodies to CHIKV to detect prior exposure and 3) studies related to the evaluation of the performance of diagnostic tests; 
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Results show that 126/687 (18%) studies reported the use of clinical signs and symptoms alone for diagnosis, mostly in resource limited countries with large ongoing epidemics. CHIKV diagnosis in humans reported in the earliest research was conducted by using a suckling mouse animal model to grow and test for the virus, but antigenic tests were soon developed. More recently, molecular tests have been developed and utilized to detect viral RNA, some offering results with a quick turnaround time. Details on the number of studies reporting on each category of CHIKV tests are available in
