<p>The observational studies above provide data on possible sylvatic hosts and the ecology of CHIKV within the studied areas. Many experimental studies were conducted to understand the potential contribution of diverse non-human vertebrate hosts to CHIKV transmission by investigating the susceptibility of these hosts to the virus. A susceptible vertebrate host in these studies is defined as an animal that exhibits symptoms of CHIKV infection and/or detectible levels of viremia within the experimental host. There were 20 studies that looked at several NHP species and other vertebrate hosts listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0207554.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. General observations included higher susceptibility in infant mice, chicks, rats and rabbits, although this was not consistent across all studies. Several studies demonstrated that a number of NHP species, some rodents and bats were susceptible to CHIKV infection, while most wild birds, domestic and farm animals and adult experimental rodents were not susceptible hosts.
