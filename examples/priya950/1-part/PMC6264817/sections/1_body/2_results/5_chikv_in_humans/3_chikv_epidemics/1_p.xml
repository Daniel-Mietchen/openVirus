<p>Over 70 chikungunya epidemics have occurred in several countries across many continents between 1959 and 2016 and were documented in 141articles; Tables

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The number of large epidemics increased steadily since the E1:A226V mutation occurred in CHIKV when

 <italic>albopictus</italic> became another and more efficient competent vector. During the epidemics in the Indian Ocean Islands in 2005–2006, a third of the population was estimated to be infected [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> were found to carry the virus [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Several articles described results from major epidemics across the Indian subcontinent from 2006 onwards (39/141; 28%). Epidemic investigation reports after CHIKV emergence in the Caribbean and South America also indicated high prevalence of exposure [

 <xref rid="pone.0207554.ref127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. These results depict the spread of CHIKV over time, either as an emerging pathogen in a new area, or a re-emerging public health risk in previously affected regions.
