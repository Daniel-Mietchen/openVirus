<p>There were 103/2326 (4%) modeling studies including quantitative risk assessment articles on chikungunya disease or competent CHIKV vectors. Exposure to CHIKV, illness, or costs attributed to chikungunya disease in humans was the outcome modeled in 58/103 (56%) articles, 1/103 (1%) article modeled CHIKV spread through birds [

 <italic>albopictus</italic>, or both. Of these, 40/103 (39%) were spatio-temporal models, 48/103 (47%) were temporal models without a spatial component, 8/103 (8%) were spatial models without a time component and 7/103 (7%) models did not incorporate time or space. There were 9/103 (9%) risk assessment models estimating reproductive numbers or the magnitude of the threat posed by CHIKV to the general population. Modeling results were relevant to North America (Canada, USA and Mexico) (10/103, 10%), Central/South America and the Caribbean (15/103, 15%), Africa (3/103, 3%), Europe (21/103, 20%), Asia (17/103, 17%), Australia and New Zealand (2/103, 2%), Oceania (2/103, 2%) and Reunion Island (15/103, 15%). We reviewed 27/103 (26%) modeling articles that were general transmission models applicable to any region. Studies also included those that predicted an outcome, such as number of cases, incidence or prevalence rates (69/103, 67%), generated a better understanding of disease transmission (41/103, 40%), evaluation of mitigation measures or programs (28/103, 27%), or evaluation of the economic burden of CHIKV outbreaks (6/103, 6%). Other studies included travel associated importation models (11/103; 11%), models assessing risk through blood donation (9/103; 9%) and a single model on spread of CHIKV through transportation of cargo (1/103; 1%). Many modeling studies generated results that fell under more than one of the above mentioned categories.
