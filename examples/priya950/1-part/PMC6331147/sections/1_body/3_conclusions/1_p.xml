<p>Although we found only a low prevalence of arboviruses in this encephalitis population, there remains a need to employ molecular tests to identify this class of viruses in patients with encephalitis. This is critical in our opinion due to epidemics caused by related flaviviruses in Brazil. Continuous monitoring of arbovirus as a cause of encephalitis is essential for the adequate treatment of these patients as well as for emphasizing a need for the implementation of sanitary measures to reduce the population of their mosquito vectors. The detection of different viruses in the central nervous system of patients with meningitis or encephalitis highlights the importance of maintaining a diagnostic laboratory capable of identifying a variety of viruses with high sensitivity [
