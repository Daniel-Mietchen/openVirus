<p>The prevalence of arbovirus-related encephalitis in subjects in our study was 2.4%, including 4 cases of DENV and 2 of SLEV. This occurrence is lower than what has been reported in other investigations [

Recent studies in New Orleans reported a 20.4% prevalence of HSV and a 5.1% prevalence of VZV in encephalitis patients [

Divergent population characteristics between SÃ£o Paulo and New Orleans as well as differences in socio-economic levels, seasonal weather variations and alterations in mosquito-related variables could account for these variations [
