<p>Epidemics of DENV and ZIKV have been recent occurrences in Brazil and they are considered to be the most important flaviviruses circulating in this country [

 <xref rid="pone.0209993.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Consequently, laboratory diagnosis during epidemic periods is directed at detection of these viruses. This hinders the detection of other circulating flaviviruses, including SLEV, which may silently becoming widely dispersed in the Americas [
