<p>In Brazil, three strains of SLEV have been isolated from the blood of patients who did not display neurological symptoms. Two patients from Pará, in the North of the country, presented with fever and jaundice, and one from São Paulo had clinical symptoms consistent with dengue fever [

 <xref rid="pone.0209993.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Non-human SLEV infections have also been found in southeastern Brazil, where the virus was isolated from wild birds, rodents and sentinel mice during a surveillance program of arbovirus activity carried out in the state of São Paulo from 1967 to 1969 [

In a study performed in cities in the Brazilian Amazon (Bragança and Salvaterra / Pará, Macapá / Amapá and Rio Branco / Acre) and in Maracaju, Mato Grosso do Sul in the midwest of the country, immunity to SLEV was identified in horses. No SLEV-associated disease was apparent in these animals [

 <xref rid="pone.0209993.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Recently, SLEV was detected by molecular techniques in four serum samples from patients with clinical suspicion of dengue and in two patients with suspected viral meningoencephalitis, all from the Municipality of São José do Rio Preto, State of São Paulo [
 <xref rid="pone.0209993.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the study by Heinen et al., SLEV was detected in three patients co-infected with DENV serotype 4 in the cities of Cuiabá and Várzea Grande, one of whom had triple co-infection with DENV subtype1 [

 <xref rid="pone.0209993.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The small number of identified SLEV infections in people in Brazil is likely due to the occurrence of asymptomatic infections as well as difficulty in the differential diagnosis of individual flaviviruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0209993.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, these studies are suggestive of a wide distribution of SLEV in Brazil [
