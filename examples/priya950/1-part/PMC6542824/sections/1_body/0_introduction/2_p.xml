<p id="Par4">Here we provide theoretical and empirical evidence to show that information about susceptibles that cannot be observed directly can be captured by a dynamic proxy variable that can be calculated in real time from incidence data alone. Specifically, we show that the stability of low-disease periods, when the dynamics are most sensitive to small variations, predicts the magnitude of the ensuing outbreak. We demonstrate the method using incidence data on dengue epidemics in San Juan Puerto Rico, to show how it can predict both the peak and the cumulative magnitude of an outbreak, and at the same time provide a quantitative early-warning indicator to identify its onset. Such forecasts can be made months in advance and as such are potentially useful for informing public health initiatives in planning and resource allocation.</p>
