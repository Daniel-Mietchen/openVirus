<p id="Par5">The theoretical set up is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> where the attractor (composed of annual epidemic cycles) is portrayed as having trajectories with a discontinuity at the end of each outbreak. Each annual excursion has two parts: an inter-disease period and the outbreak itself. This suggests a mixed modeling approach where we distinguish the equilibrium dynamics of the inter-outbreak period (April-August for dengue in San Juan) from the ensuing unstable outbreak dynamics. This distinction is supported by an EDM analysis of dengue in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (see Methods). Importantly, we view the transition from the previous year’s outbreak to the early inter-outbreak period as a stochastic discontinuity in the otherwise conitnuous dynamics. It is a time when complex vital dynamic mechanisms set the initial conditions that characterize the susceptible pool for the next outbreak— a high dimensional gap in the temporal evolution. In simple terms, this corresponds to a class of models having local disease-free equilibria that are not unique and are not endemic, but are parameterized anew with each epidemic cycle.  During the inter-outbreak period the attractor is trivial (a stable disease-free equilibrium), higher dimensional during the outbreak itself, and very high dimensional (stochastic discontinuity) between cycles (a hypothesis validated for dengue in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Again, the discontinuity determines which inter-outbreak trajectory the system will follow into the next epidemic cycle, and thereby sets the initial conditions for the ensuing outbreak.
