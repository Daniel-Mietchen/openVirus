<p id="Par10">We demonstrate the approach with an analysis of the record of dengue hospitalizations in San Juan, Puerto Rico. To validate the mixed modeling framework asserted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, we perform an empirical dynamic analysis on the data (EDM)

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows that the inter-outbreak periods have an optimal embedding dimension, 
 <italic>E</italic> = 3 and linear equilibrium dynamics consistent with local contraction of the dynamics onto a point equilibrium (random linear displacements around a fixed point), while the outbreaks involve regions of the attractor that are significantly higher dimensional, 
 <italic>E</italic> = 9, and exhibit nonlinear dynamics (see Methods). This evidence supports the theoretical set up as described above.
