 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> shows how the predictive skill (Pearson correlation) with simplex projection varies with embedding dimension. The inter-disease periods are defined as the time series segments containing data points between 30 and 12 weeks prior to the outbreak onsets. This yields 20 time series segments. The simplex predictions were made out of sample by using the first ten of these to construct the “library” attractor that is used to forecast the last ten segments out of sample.
