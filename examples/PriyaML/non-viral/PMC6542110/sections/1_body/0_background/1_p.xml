<p id="Par11">Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is closely related to human T-lymphotropic virus, both of which belong to the

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. BLV infection can cause enzootic leukosis in cattle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and lead to a reduction in milk production and quality and to decreased longevity in dairy cattle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently, a correlation between human breast cancer and BLV infection was proposed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
