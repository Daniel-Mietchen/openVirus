<p id="Par13">Accordingly, we performed an initial investigation of BLV epidemiology in dairy cattle in six major regions of HLJ. We were able to detect BLV proviral DNA in samples from four of these regions. After sequencing, we found that G1, G6, and a new genotype, G11, were prevalent in HLJ. Combined with recent domestic reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], our results indicated that BLV infection is common in China, where G1, G6, G10, and G11 are the currently known BLV genotypes.
