<p id="Par16">A further analysis of these nonsynonymous substitution sites indicated that they were distributed in several domains of BLV gp51. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, in alignment with CAM69, we found eight substitutions in the neutralizing domain 2 (ND2) (131–149), four in the zinc-binding region (ZB) (137–155), three in the CD8+ T-cell epitope region (154–182), three in the E-epitope region (175–194), and one in the B-epitope region (228–238). Substitutions in these epitope regions indicated that BLV underwent intense immune pressure in vivo. In addition to these substitution sites, conserved regions of our isolates were observed in neutralizing domain 1 (ND1), CD4+ T-cell epitope region, and neutralizing domain 3 (ND3), which could indicate their critical importance in viral fitness cost. Notably, two N-linked glycosylation sites were located in the gp51 423-bp region (N129KS and N230KS/T).
