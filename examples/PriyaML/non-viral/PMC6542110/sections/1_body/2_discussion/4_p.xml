<p id="Par22">BLV genotypes have been reported in countries near HLJ, China. For instance, G1, G5, and G7 were prevalent in Mongolia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; G1 and G3 were found in Korea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; and G1, G3, and G5 were circulating in Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our results showed that BLV was clustered into three clades in HLJ, including G1, G6, and G11. G1 was prevalent in JX and SH, and G6 existed in DQ, whereas G6 and G11 were circulating in HRB. Notably, G6 and G10 were reported to be prevalent in the yaks of southwestern China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, to date, G1 is currently the dominant genotype in HLJ, China, and surrounding countries, and G6 appeares in both southwestern and northeastern China. Determining whether G6 is prevalent all over China also deserves further exploration.
