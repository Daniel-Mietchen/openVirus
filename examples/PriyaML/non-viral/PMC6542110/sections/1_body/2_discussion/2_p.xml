<p id="Par20">Our results confirmed that 68 of 730 samples were identified as BLV-positive, with an overall infection rate of 9.3%. However, it was indicated that BLV epidemics displayed regional differentiations in HLJ. The BLV infection rate in JX was the highest (31%) and that of DQ, HRB, and SH was lower, whereas QQHR and MDJ showed null BLV infection. A previous study also reported null BLV infection in QQHR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which was in accordance with our results. Notably, because only 100 samples in QQHR (in both Yang et al [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and our assay) and 60 samples in MDJ were collected, monitoring more samples would further confirm these cases. If these cases are confirmed, then the low BLV infection status in both QQHR and MDJ should provide a good reference for us to control BLV transmission of other regions. In the HLJ territory, DQ, SH, and HRB were adjacent to each other and far from JX. However, the isolates of SH and JX clustered into one clade, whereas DQ and HRB isolates clustered into other clades, which could suggest a lack of correlation among the BLV genotypes with regional adjacency. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether SH retained the same viral clade as that in both DQ and HRB. Cattle in JX have been bred for several decades within farms and not often imported. Thus, the high infection rate of these cattle could be derived from the low management of breeding measures, which indicates the necessity to strengthen herd control and periodic monitoring. Currently, no effective vaccines exist to control BLV infection and transmission. Therefore, taking measures to monitor and isolate BLV-infected individuals (especially individuals with high viral loads [
