<p>Borna disease virus-1 (BoDV-1) is a neurotropic pathogen in the genus 
 <italic>Orthobornavirus</italic> (family 
 <italic>Bornaviridae</italic>) that causes mononuclear encephalomyelitis in horses.
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> This disease is endemic in certain areas in central Europe including Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Austria and is usually fatal. The reservoir host of this virus is the bicolored white-toothed shrew (
 <italic>Crocidura leucodon</italic>), but natural infection can occur occasionally in equids and other animals such as sheep, cattle, llamas, cats, dogs, and ostriches.
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> A landscape modeling study conducted in an endemic area suggested that horses come into contact with shrews in dry habitats such as grasslands and stables.
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> In Germany, close to the town of Borna, large numbers of horses died in the late 1800s.
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> In the 1990s, the incidence was much lower, around 100 horses per year in the endemic area.
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Recently, a new endemic area in Austria was reported after confirmation of lethal disease in horses.
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> One case has been reported in the United Kingdom in a horse imported from Germany.
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Antibodies against Bornaviruses have been detected in equids in non-endemic areas of Europe, Iceland, Turkey, Israel, Japan, China, Iran, Australia, and United States.
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> However, it is not considered proof of infection due to the cross-reactivity with avian Bornaviruses.
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> There are sporadic reports of confirmed human BoDV-1 infection including a recent fatal encephalitis case,
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> but it is unclear whether these represent interspecies transmission from horses or other hosts. An association between BoDV-1 infection and human neuropsychiatric disease was first reported in 1985,
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> although this remains controversial.
