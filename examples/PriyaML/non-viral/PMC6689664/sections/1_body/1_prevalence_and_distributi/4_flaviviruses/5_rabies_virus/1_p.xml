<p>Rabies virus, a neurotropic virus in the genus 
 <italic>Lyssavirus</italic> (family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>), is one of the deadliest zoonoses worldwide.
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> European countries, Iceland, Greenland, New Zealand, and Australia are considered free of this disease, but it is present on the American, African, and Asian continents.
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> All mammals are susceptible, but canids and bats are the major vectors. Transmission is via saliva, mainly when a rabid animal bites another animal. Rabies infection is relatively rare in horses; only 23 rabid equids were reported in the United States in 2016 and 13 in 2017.
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Nevertheless, in some African countries, large numbers of rabies cases occur in equids, including donkeys, and there may occasionally be transmission to people.
