<p>Vector-borne diseases are often restricted to temperate climates due to the range of the insects.
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> However, with climate change, the areas inhabited by virus-transmitting insects are changing.

 <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref> The spread of vector-borne viruses is strongly influenced by temperature. Temperature has an effect on the life cycle of the insects, as well as the extrinsic incubation period (the time between a vector acquiring an infectious agent and becoming infectious). The average global temperature is predicted to increase between 1°C and 4.6°C during this century.
 <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> Increased temperatures and altered rainfall patterns are likely to affect the range and behavior of insect vectors.
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> Access to breeding sites also has an effect on the distribution of mosquitoes; an increased transmission of EEE virus has been associated with the freshwater hardwood swamps in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and the Great Lakes region (USA).
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This is important to consider in the case of vector-borne diseases, as even if an infected host enters a naïve population, the virus cannot spread without the presence of its vector. The main species of vector, geographical distribution, and zoonotic potential vary between equine encephalitic viruses.
