<p>It is not possible to predict when a new virus (either a newly identified pathogen or a known pathogen in a new geographical area) will emerge. However, models to assess the risk of a virus entering a population and changes in risk over time can be developed. There are also models for the risk of disease introduction through host movement.

 <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> Countries can be characterized as high risk (virus circulating), low risk (previous outbreaks and/or main vector present), and very low risk. If different host species or reasons for travel are associated with different risk levels then these can be further subdivided into groups. Risk pathways can then be constructed for the steps required for incursion (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). From these pathways, stochastic risk models that quantify the risk that importation of different groups of animals can be developed. These methods allow us to assess control strategies such as quarantine and their effectiveness on different risk groups.
