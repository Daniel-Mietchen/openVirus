  <p>Phylogenetic tree of a 224 bp portion of the 5′-UTR nucleotide sequences. The BVDV strains isolated from goats in southwestern China, with Pestivirus reference strains of BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BVDV-3, and BDV registered in GenBank database. The tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method, bootstrapping (1,000 replications), and the Kimura three parameter statistical model of MEGA 7.0 software. The 12 isolated sequences from goat serum in this study are designated with “blue circle”.</p>
