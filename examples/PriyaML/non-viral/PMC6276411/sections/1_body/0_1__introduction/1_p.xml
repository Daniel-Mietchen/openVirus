<p>Bovine viral diarrhea virus–1 (BVDV–1) and BVDV–2, together with classical swine fever virus and border disease virus (BDV), are currently classified as the genus
 <italic> Pestivirus</italic> and family
 <italic> Flaviviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A new unclassified
 <italic> Pestivirus</italic> species, HoBi-like virus, was first identified in fetal bovine serum from Brazil and was related to BVDV at the antigenic and genetic levels. Thus, the viruses were referred to as “BVDV–3” [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To date, a growing number unassigned atypical
 <italic> Pestivirus </italic>species have been detected in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; however, such emerging pestiviruses have not been officially recognized. To resolve the taxonomy of pestiviruses, a new taxonomy for the genus
 <italic> Pestivirus </italic>(family
 <italic> Flaviviridae</italic>) was proposed, where all species were redesignated as
 <italic> Pestivirus A-Pestivirus K</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
