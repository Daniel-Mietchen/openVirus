<p>BVDV has a single stranded positive sense RNA genome of 12.3–12.5 kb. The full-length viral genome is flanked at both ends by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and contains a single open reading frame that encodes a single polyprotein that is approximately 4000 amino acids. The genetic diversity of novel
 <italic> Pestivirus</italic> strains is usually based on the characteristics of partial sequences from the 5′–UTR, N
 <sup>pro</sup> or E2 regions of the genome. However, the 5′–UTR of Pestiviruses has the highest degree of sequence conservation and is therefore most frequently used for phylogenetic analysis. According to sequence comparison analyses of this region, there are 21 subtypes of BVDV–1(1a–1u) [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and four subtypes of BVDV–2 (2a–2d) [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
