<p>BVDV–1m is another major subtype in this region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Four BVDV-1-positive samples identified in this study were classified as BVDV–1m. The isolates, FS1605, CF1374, DF1312, and DB1503, had 94.5%–98.7% homology with each other and shared 95.4%–97.0% homology with the BVDV–1m reference strain ZM–95 (AF526381) (
