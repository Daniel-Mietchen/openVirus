<p>Viral RNA was extracted from 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L aliquots of goat serum using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN China, Shanghai, China), following the manufacturer's recommendations. Four different PCR assays for BVDV–1 [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], BVDV–2 [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], BVDV–3 [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and BDV [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] were performed to amplify the respective targets. The PCR products were purified and sequenced by the JIELI Biology Company (Shanghai, China).
