<p>Interestingly, unlike the other age groups, the adolescence group showed more HSP patients in summer (August) than during autumn (September to November). Due to the number of patients in this group, it is expected that the overall outbreak of HSP among patients in August was more, though a clear cause for this increase in incidence could not be determined. However, our finding with bocavirus, which appeared to be most active during relatively warm weather, is clearly interesting. Although not investigated in this study, additional studies are needed to determine the association with enteroviruses that occur in summer. Comparison of the virus epidemics based on the age groups of the patients also produced interesting results. Depending on the age group, there were various types of viruses that were temporally associated with HSP. RSV showed a similar temporal pattern in the early childhood group but was not confirmed in all patients and other age groups. While norovirus was associated with HSP in early childhood and middle childhood group, rotavirus that rarely occurred in early adolescence also showed an association with HSP. Even if it occurs after a viral infection, it is difficult to confirm that a single virus is a causative agent. Nevertheless, our study is significant because it suggests the possibility of a causative disease by confirming the coincidence of HSP and some viruses that were not previously linked to HSP such as rotavirus, norovirus, or bocavirus. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings. Because existing predisposing factors are often not directly evidenced by causal relationships, but rather through anecdotal cases, the results of this study about relationship to seasonal variation may raise the possibility of a novel pathogen associated with HSP.</p>
