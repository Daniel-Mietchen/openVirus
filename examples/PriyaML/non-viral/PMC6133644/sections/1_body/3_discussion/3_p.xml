<p>Of all the HSP patients in this study, 17.6% were hospitalized, and 15 of them were operated on. However, since only the patients who were first diagnosed with HSP between January 2013 and December 2016 were included in the study, we could only identify those who were hospitalized at the time of the first diagnosis. Patients who visited the hospital for the first time and did not get hospitalized, but were later admitted or operated due to severe symptoms, were excluded from the study. Therefore, the proportion of the inpatients and the number of surgical patients are expected to be slightly higher than found in our results</p>
