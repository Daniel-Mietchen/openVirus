<p>The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect data on pathogens that cause acute respiratory and enteric infectious diseases from various hospitals across the country and publish weekly information on the occurrence of each pathogen in South Korea. We extracted data on viruses causing various respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases from this database. From this data, we identified the patients who tested positive for 8 respiratory viruses (adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], influenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus) and 4 enteric viruses (rotavirus, norovirus, enteric adenovirus, and astrovirus) using a viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, from the first week of January 2013 to the last week of December 2016. Epidemic trends were investigated according to the time of onset of the virus by week, month, season, and year.</p>
