<p>Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref> compares the onset of HSP among the different age groups with each of the virus epidemics. No significant correlations were detected in the infant group. In the early childhood group, the onset of HSP was found to be associated with epidemics of RSV, influenza virus, and norovirus. In the middle childhood group, influenza virus and norovirus epidemics were associated with the seasonality of HSP. The epidemic period of bocavirus and rotavirus coincided with that of HSP among the adolescents.
