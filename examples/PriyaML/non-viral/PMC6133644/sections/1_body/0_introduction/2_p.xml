 </sup> HSP in adults is rare than in children but often progresses to a serious condition leading to chronic complications. Its annual incidence is estimated to be 15 cases/100,000 per year in children compared with 1.3 cases/100,000 per year in adults. Skin symptoms occur mainly in the lower extremities or hips, but they can also involve the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. In acute cases, severe abdominal pain, arthralgia, or proteinuria may develop.

 </sup> Complications such as intussusception, perforation, and renal failure may also occur, and an accurate diagnosis is needed at the onset of the disease.
