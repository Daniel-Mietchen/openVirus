<p id="Par1">Viral infections remain a global threat to world health in the twenty-first century. They are caused by both DNA and RNA viruses and can manifest as acute or chronic infections, in some cases causing epidemics or even global pandemics. Persistent viral infections lead to host immunodeficiency and the development of ~â€‰12% of human cancers worldwide. Viral infections in animals can spread to humans and cause human disease; such zoonotic events have become increasingly frequent as a result of close contact in modern society due to globalization, industrialization and environment changes. In facing these challenges, both developed and developing countries, including China and the US, spend billions of dollars annually to support basic virology research and to develop effective strategies to prevent, treat, and cure viral infections. The establishment of the State Key Laboratory of Virology (SKLV) in 2004, the year that followed the outbreak of SARS in China, highlights this great effort by the China central government with joint sponsorship of Wuhan University and Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The SKLV conducts high-level basic and applied research focusing on the viruses that cause major and severe infectious diseases, aiming to develop new strategies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viral diseases.</p>
