  <p>Overview of virus taxonomy prediction by “Genome Relationships Applied to Virus Taxonomy” (GRAViTy). A simplified diagram of the steps used to construct profile tables from sequences of viruses with assigned taxonomic status (reference virus genomes). It further illustrates the steps to classify viruses of of undetermined taxonomic relationships. The method is based on extraction of protein sequences from reference virus genomes and their clustering using pairwise BLASTp bit scores. Sequences in each cluster are then aligned and turned into a Protein Profile Hidden Markov Model (PPHMM). Reference genomes are subsequently scanned against the database of PPHMMs to determine the locations of their genes, and Genomic Organisation Models (GOMs) for each virus family are constructed. These models form the core of the genome annotator (Annotator), which is used to annotate query sequences with information on the presence of genes and the degree of similarity of their genomic organisation to reference virus sequences. From this, genome relationships can be extracted by computation of various genetic distance metrics, including composite generalised Jaccard similarity, which forms the basis for heat maps and dendrograms that depict the relationships of query sequences to the dataset of classified viruses (Classifier) and recommendations for their taxonomic assignments (Evaluator).</p>
