  <p>First results of our VeGETApipeline on an example input set consisting of flaviviruses. We were able to identify the West-Nile Virus (WNV), Dengue Virus 1 (DENV1), Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), Yellow Fever Virus (YFW), Saint Louis Encephalitis Virus (SLEV) and Murray Valley Encephalitis Virus (MVEV) as representative viruses from downloaded virus genomes [
   <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The resulting alignment calculated by VeGETA has structure annotations for the complete genomes, including 5’ UTR, coding regions and 3’ UTR. Here, we extracted the 5’ UTR from the alignment and visualized the annotated structure elements. These elements agree with the literature [
   <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], as we were able to reconstruct the SLA, SLL, SLBand cHPelements accurately. The first two elements were recognized by the viral replication mechanism (NS5) [
   <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The sequence embedded in the SLB structure is known to play a role in the genome circularization of flaviviruses [
   <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], whereas the cHP facilitates the translation of the coding region by pausing the translation machinery and finding the correct starting triplet [
