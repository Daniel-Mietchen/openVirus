  <p>Set of 
   <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> phages on the vertical axis, which includes six well-characterised myoviruses from Martha Clokiesâ€™ laboratory (red dots). The genes commonly identified in 
   <italic>C. difficile</italic> phages are shown on the horizontal axis and homologous genes represented by a green line. It is clear that these phages do not share a large common gene set.
