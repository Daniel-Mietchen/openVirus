<p>To illustrate the diversity within one specific phage set, Martha Clokie presented the work from her lab on phages that infect the gut pathogen

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They have identified sets of phages that target clinically-relevant and prevalent strains. Despite the most effective phage set being isolated from one geographical location, they are strikingly variable (
