<p>While the conservation of genomic architecture between distantly-related bacteriophages as outlined above is a striking observation, many open questions remain. For example, it remains unclear to what extent the observations of conserved genomic architecture described above reflect a biased sampling, for example of temperate, dsDNA and/or tailed bacteriophages that have been observed to dominate, e.g., marine systems [

Nevertheless, viruses have vast global population sizes that result in highly-efficient evolutionary selection pressures and optimized genomes. Moreover, viruses and their cellular hosts have been co-evolving for billions of years, allowing ample time for optimization of their genome structures.
