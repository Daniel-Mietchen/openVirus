<p>Viromics or viral metagenomics has been proposed as an alternative method to qPCR-based approaches for the detection of pathogenic viruses linked to food- and water-borne illness in the aquatic environment [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The main advantage is that viral communities can be investigated without prior knowledge of the genome sequences or genotypes of the viruses present in the sample. There are, however, several drawbacks associated with viromics, such as laboratory and computational costs, scalability and the issue of viral dark matter in which sequence data are classified as “unknown”. In her presentation, Evelien Adriaenssens focused on the latter aspect and showed that reconstruction of Uncultivated Virus Genomes (UViGs) [

 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], she showed that they can identify pathogenic virus genomes present in the Conwy River catchment area, mainly found in wastewater [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and showed changing abundance patterns between sample sites and types. Using species-level clustering and differential read mapping, comparative genomics and phylogenetics, she could gradually descend from the bigger picture of viral diversity to strain-level resolution, identifying the genotype of potentially pathogenic viruses. This workflow is ideally suited to find new pathogenic viral species and identify markers for wastewater contamination of the environment.
