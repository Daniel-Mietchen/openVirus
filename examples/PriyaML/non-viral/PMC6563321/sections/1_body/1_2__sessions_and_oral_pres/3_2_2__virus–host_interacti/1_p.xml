<p>This session was chaired by David Robertson (MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, United Kingdom), the local organizer of the meeting. Bacteriophages, the viruses of bacteria, are an important and usually neglected component of microbiome studies. Two speakers have been invited on this topic. Martha Clokie (University of Leicester, United Kingdom) presented about the roles of phages in impacting infectious diseases in human microbiomes. EVBC member Bas Dutilh (Utrecht University, Netherlands) presented about global phylogeography and the ancient evolution of the widespread human gut virus crAssphage. From the submitted abstracts, we selected talks by Katherine Brown (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom) on viral transcripts in RNA-seq datasets from bees, mites, and ants, Evelien Adriaenssens (Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich, United Kingdom) on genome-resolved metaviromics for the detection of pathogenic viruses in the environment and Josquin Daron (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Montpellier, France) on codon usage preference similarity among human-infecting viruses and their hosts.</p>
