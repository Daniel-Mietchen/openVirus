<p>Viral mutation rates (including recombination rates) have remained difficult to quantify due to a lack of evolutionary calibration points. For example, on a short time scale of thirty years, a constant recombination rate of five events per year has been observed for Siphoviridae bacteriophages [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but when longer timespans are assessed, mutation rate estimates may drop dramatically by orders of magnitude [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. One way of obtaining ancient calibration points in viral evolution in the absence of fossil data is by exploiting their association to hosts. One of the most conserved constituents of the human gut virome is the widespread and abundant bacteriophage crAssphage [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recently, near-complete genome sequences of crAss-like viruses were detected in faecal samples of a range of wild non-human primates living on different continents, including Old-World monkeys, New-World monkeys and apes [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Strikingly, these genomes revealed a strong collinearity with human-associated crAss-like viruses, suggesting that the association of crAss-like viruses with the primate gut biome may be millions of years old. Moreover, these findings open the door to investigations into viral mutation rates at long time-scales, once again illustrating how viral metagenomics opens up a treasure trove for virus discovery [
