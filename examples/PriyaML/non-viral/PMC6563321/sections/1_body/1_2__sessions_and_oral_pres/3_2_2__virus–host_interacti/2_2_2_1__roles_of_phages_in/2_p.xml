<p>A major limitation for our ability to develop therapeutic phages and also understand fully the ways that phages impact bacteria is that the vast majority of phage gene functions are hypothetical or unknown. In bacterial genomes, there are around 25% unknown genes, or genes that have no known ascribed function, but in phage genomes, only around 25% of the genes are generally known! Thus, when trying to establish how phages specifically interact with their hosts, there is large number of genes of which we need to try and make sense.</p>
