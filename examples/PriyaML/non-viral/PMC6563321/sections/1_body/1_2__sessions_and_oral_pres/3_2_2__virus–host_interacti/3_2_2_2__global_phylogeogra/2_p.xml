<p>Moreover, the genome sequence in individual viral lineages may be more conserved than could previously be recognized. Recently, large-scale comparisons of gene order in the genome sequences of dsDNA bacteriophages revealed a surprisingly conserved genomic structure [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A possible mechanism at play is the genomic encoding of different transcriptional regions with promoters that govern the expression of early, middle and late specific genes, such as known from the well-studied case of the T4 bacteriophage [
