<p>While viruses are vastly abundant and ubiquitous throughout the biosphere, they have remained a relatively unexplored superkingdom of life. Early findings of genomic mosaicism [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] have led to the conception of viruses as genomically highly variable entities. This was further supported as metagenomics unveiled the extent of genetic diversity of viruses, initially in marine water and human faeces [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and in many different biomes since. Images of an unparalleled diversity that is dominated by unknown sequences has been the common theme of viral metagenomic explorations. However, while the virosphere is undoubtedly diverse, ubiquitous viruses are increasingly being discovered by metagenomic analysis of globally-distributed, ecologically-stable ecosystems, including once again the global oceans [
