<p>The human respiratory epithelium is a pseudostratified epithelium that constitutes the first line of defence against invading respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses. Although several studies have now shown that both viral transcript production and the innate immune response to infection vary widely among single influenza-infected cells, the cause of this extreme heterogeneity remains unclear [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. More specifically, it remains unknown how key innate immune components are distributed among the different cell populations found in the respiratory epithelium and how the latter may influence the host response to infection. To determine the distribution of these innate immune components and to examine how specific cell types respond to influenza infection, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to acquire transcriptomes from primary human Airway Epithelial Cells (hAEC) infected with Influenza A Virus (IAV) (

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A low MOI was used to infect hAECs with either Wild-Type (WT) pandemic IAV or an NS1mutated form of the virus (NS1R38A) that impairs its ability to counteract Interferon (IFN) and produces an amplified innate immune response. We then annotated both host and viral transcriptomes of more than 19,000 single cells across the five major hAEC cell types for mock, WT, and NS1R38A conditions. We observed a large heterogeneity in viral burden; however, in contrast to what was found in previous studies, no absence of viral genes was detected. Interestingly, in both WT- and NS1R38A-infected cultures, there was a significant decrease in the fraction of ciliated and goblet cells compared to mock hAECs. We also identified a number of cell-type-specific innate immune responses, including the expression of type I and III IFNs in all major cell types. Collectively, our results represent the first comprehensive report on how individual cells contribute to the antiviral response during IAV infection in the context of the human respiratory epithelium.
