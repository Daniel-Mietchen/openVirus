<p>Since RNA viruses have fast mutation rates and variable sequences, transmission routes between places and host species can be inferred [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. One approach is to group sequences from individual hosts into discrete locations and/or host species and consider these as discrete traits or subpopulations on time-resolved phylogenetic trees, with the goal to infer which group infected which. Alternatively, locations may be represented as continuous traits (latitude and longitude) in order to estimate spatial diffusion rates and routes.
