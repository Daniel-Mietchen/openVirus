<p>For a virus to have epidemic potential in human populations, an infected individual must be capable of transmitting the infection to other individuals. However, for the majority of human RNA virus species, human infections are acquired only from non-human reservoirs. The evolution of human transmissibility is poorly understood. Through parallel analyses of 1755 RNA viruses, we identified at least 90 nodes across 39 genus-level phylogenies associated with transitions involving the gain of human infectivity and/or transmissibility. Human-infective and human-transmissible viruses evolve independently, and at least 73% of human-transmissible RNA virus lineages emerged directly from non-human virus lineages in diverse mammal or bird taxa. Negative sense single-stranded RNA virus lineages generate a higher proportion of strictly zoonotic viruses. Our analysis demonstrates that RNA viruses from mammal/bird lineages not currently known to be infective to humans are a likely source of future epidemics in human populations, a public health threat recently designated “Disease X”.</p>
