<p>This session was chaired by Edward Hutchinson (MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, United Kingdom). Two speakers have been invited on this topic. Samantha Lycett (University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom) presented about phylodynamics for tracking epidemic, endemic and evolving viral strains. Roman Biek (University of Glasgow, United Kingdom) presented about leveraging pathogen genomics to reveal and control the spread of rabies virus. From the submitted abstracts, we selected talks by Marina Escalera-Zamudio (University of Oxford, United Kingdom) on parallel evolution and the emergence of highly-pathogenic avian influenza A viruses, David Bauer (University of Oxford, United Kingdom) on the structure of the influenza A virus genome and Lu Lu (University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom) on the evolutionary origins of the epidemic potential among human RNA viruses.</p>
