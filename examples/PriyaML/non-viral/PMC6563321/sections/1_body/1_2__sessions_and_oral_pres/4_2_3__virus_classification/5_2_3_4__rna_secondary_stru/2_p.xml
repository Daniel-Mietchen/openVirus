<p>In order to increase the confidence of predictions, Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) are needed, since they provide conservation information between viruses. Identifying conserved secondary structures in whole genomes of viruses is computationally challenging, as the whole genome has to be considered for possible structures and interactions.</p>
