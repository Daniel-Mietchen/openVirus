<p>The taxonomy of the 20 currently-classified prokaryotic virus families differs substantially [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Members of three families in particular (
 <italic>Podoviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Siphoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Myoviridae</italic>) were far more divergent from each other than observed within eukaryotic and archaeal virus families. Applying a CGJ distance threshold of 0.8, prokaryotic viruses form over 100 groupings equivalent to eukaryotic virus families. The use of a common benchmark with which to compare taxonomies of eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses supports ongoing efforts by the ICTV to revise thoroughly the phage taxonomy so that assignment criteria are consistent across all virus groups. Developing a consistent classification of viruses in which assignments at family and other taxonomic levels extending the current framework, but which will be underpinned both by metrics of genomic relatedness, is essential for future, evidence-based classification of metagenomic viruses.
