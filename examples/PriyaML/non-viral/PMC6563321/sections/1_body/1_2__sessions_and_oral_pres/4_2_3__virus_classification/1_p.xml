<p>This session was chaired by Darren Obbard (University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom). Two speakers have been invited on this topic. Peter Simmonds (University of Oxford, United Kingdom) presented about classification of viruses in metagenomic datasets. Unfortunately, Olga Kalinina (Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr√ºcken, Germany) was unable to make it to the meeting. Instead, Manja Marz (Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany), Managing director of the EVBC, presented about machine learning applied to virus data. From the submitted abstracts, we selected talks by Julian Susat (Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Kiel, Germany) on the detection of viruses in ancient human remains, Aare Abroi (University of Tartu, Estonia) on the relation between virosphere and biosphere, and Kevin Lamkiewicz (Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany) on RNA secondary structures in whole genome alignments of viruses. Based on this submission, Kevin was competitively awarded the PhD travel award.</p>
