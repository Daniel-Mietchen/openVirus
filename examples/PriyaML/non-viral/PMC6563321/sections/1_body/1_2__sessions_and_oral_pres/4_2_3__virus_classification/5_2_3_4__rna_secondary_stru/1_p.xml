<p>RNA secondary structures are known to play important roles in viruses, and especially in RNA viruses, since they can initiate and facilitate transcription, translation and replication. Several studies indicate that structures are cis-acting regulators for transcription. However, only looking at local structures is not sufficient to capture all RNAâ€“RNA interactions of one molecule. Long-Range Interactions (LRI) are described in a few RNA virus families [
