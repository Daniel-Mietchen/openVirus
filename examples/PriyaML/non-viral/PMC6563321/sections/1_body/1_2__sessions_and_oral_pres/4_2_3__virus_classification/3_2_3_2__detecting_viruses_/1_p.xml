<p>The field of ancient DNA covers a wide range of research topics, spanning from human evolution, megafauna to pathogen evolution. Despite the recent advantages in ancient DNA techniques and modern metagenomic screening tools, the identification of authentic viral sequences from ancient material is still challenging. The materials that are mainly used in ancient DNA research, teeth and petrous bones, already limit the number of detectable viruses by their nature. Only viruses that are present in the bloodstream can be detected. The fast evolution of viral pathogens and therefore the comparability to modern variability in viruses makes it even more difficult to identify their ancestors reliably. The highly-fragmented and degraded nature of ancient genetic material and the high risk of modern contamination are causing further problems in the analysis. For the detection of viruses, a wide variety of software utilizing different approaches like HMMs, dedicated marker genes and complete genome references are available to screen these ancient samples for the presence of pathogens. Each of these approaches has its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses. In a competitive alignment approach using all complete virus genomes as a reference, we were able to detect three Hepatitis-B Viruses (HBV) during our regular screening. All three samples originated in Germany and dated to the mediaeval times (1000 BP) and the Neolithic (5000 and 7000 BP). After sequencing and competitive mapping against 16 HBV references, complete HBV genomes could be recovered from all three samples. This resulted in the oldest human pathogenic viral genome that is known up to know. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the medieval strain was genotype D and surprisingly conserved. The ancient Neolithic strains were closer together than to any other modern and closest to strains from Old-World monkeys. These findings might suggest reciprocal cross-species transmission between human and ape. Furthermore, we could show that the genomic structure of ancient strains closely resembles the structure of modern HBV strains. Since publishing these results, we and others detected more HBV-positive samples, supporting the notion that viruses will become more important for the aDNAcommunity (

A bigger number of HBV cases spanning over longer time frames opens the door for reliable diachronic analysis and maybe even epidemiological analysis. Besides the recent findings of ancient viruses (e.g., Parvovirus), an open question still remains how we could detect and reconstruct extinct or highly-altered virus genomes. Bioinformatic protocols for the detection of unknown viral protein families based on long sequencing reads and high coverage data are published and available, but due to the above-described nature of aDNA, applying these methods is not straightforward, and strong optimization needs to be carried out. Still, these HBV and other findings have opened a new door within the aDNA community and blazed a trail for upcoming viral ancient DNA studies. This work was done by a team composed of Ben Krause-Kyora, Julian Susat, Felix M. Key, Denise KÃ¼hnert, Alexander Immel, Alexander Herbig, Almut Nebel and Johannes Krause.
