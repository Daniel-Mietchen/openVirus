<p>Here, we give an overview of the landscape of RNA secondary structures in viruses and provide a pipeline that generates whole genome alignments with structure annotation for downstream analyses. Our pipeline distinguishes itself from other tools by considering both the sequence and structure of input genomes for the final alignment. Therefore, for the first time, the generation of structure-annotated whole genome alignments for viruses enables sophisticated and comprehensive downstream analysis for RNA structures and RNA functions. This is achieved with an iterative combination of the sequence-based aligner MAFFT [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and the structure-based aligner LocARNA [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. For our example case, we were able to predict structures in the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00420" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] that are consistent with described structures in the literature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00420-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Further, we predicted novel structural elements in coding regions of genomes.
