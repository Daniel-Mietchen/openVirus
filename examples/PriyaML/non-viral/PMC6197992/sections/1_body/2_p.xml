<p id="p0020">This guest edited issue contains the first group of reviews to mark the centennial of the influenza pandemic which swept the world in 1918, continuing into the following year. The outbreak was characterized by catastrophic mortality, illness, social and economic disruption, reminiscent of previous epidemics of smallpox, plague and cholera. It coincided with the termination of the Great War, which contributed to susceptibility and dissemination of infection, yet its role in the onset of the influenza pandemic is not entirely clear. The pandemic initiated a pattern of subsequent epidemics attributed to major genetic shifts in the viral strains and less severe seasonal mutations. The search for a universal vaccine and effective antiviral drugs continues, even though the original virus has been recovered and a great deal is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of infection and its spread in human populations and animal reservoirs. The viral-host response has been described in great detail, but much remains uncertain about the virulence of the original pandemic and the secondary infection by bacteria in the lung. The role of individual genetic susceptibility and of innate and adaptive immunity are only now beginning to be unraveled by genomic, molecular and cellular advances.</p>
