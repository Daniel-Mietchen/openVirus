<p>Hygiene improvements and changes in the biological properties of circulating viruses are invoked as alternative, potential key drivers of the observed trends. While we agree that these factors may have made an important contribution, the authors may have overlooked a further possible cause, which is the changes in climate that have occurred in Europe over the past 40 years.
 <xref rid="irv12636-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> There is ample epidemiological evidence that supports the notion that the occurrence of influenza epidemics is driven by climatic parameters, in particular absolute humidity and temperature in temperate climate countries.
 <xref rid="irv12636-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Under cold‐dry conditions, which are common in temperate countries during the winter months, virus survival and host susceptibility are enhanced, thus favoring the transmission of influenza viruses and the onset of epidemics.
 <xref rid="irv12636-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Researchers have long expressed concern that ongoing climate change may have modified (and continue to do so in the future) the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections, including influenza, for instance by modifying the timing, size, and duration of epidemics.
