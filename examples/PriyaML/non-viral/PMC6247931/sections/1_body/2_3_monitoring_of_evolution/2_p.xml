<p>For many pathogens, the emergence and spread of gain-of-function variants is a grave concern. For instance, China has experienced seasonal epidemics of influenza A/H7N9 over the past five years. Despite no known human-to human-transmission events, the high mortality rate of 30% (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>) makes the threat of mutations which facilitate human-to-human transmission of extreme concern. For example, mutations identified by

  <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)
 </xref> are readily visible at nextstrain.org/avian/h7n9. Continual monitoring of such putatively adaptive mutations is critical.
