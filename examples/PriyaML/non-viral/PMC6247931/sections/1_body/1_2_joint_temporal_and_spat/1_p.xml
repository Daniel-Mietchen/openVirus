<p>Conveying understanding of pathogen evolution through space and time involves filtering large amounts of data into forms that can be easily reasoned with. Multiple views into different facets of the data are presented and remain in sync as one interacts with the data. This allows simultaneous interrogation of phylogenetic and spatial relationships, with additional data such as genotype or serotype expressed through colourings (

By animating the temporal dimension, a high level overview of how the entire outbreak unfolded is quickly gained. This approach both communicates the geographical spread of the epidemic alongside the underlying genomic data that supports this geographic reconstruction.
