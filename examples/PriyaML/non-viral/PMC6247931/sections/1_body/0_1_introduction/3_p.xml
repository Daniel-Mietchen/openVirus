<p>Nextstrain consists of data curation, analysis and visualization components: Python scripts maintain a database of available sequences and related metadata, sourced from public repositories such as NCBI (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>), GISAID (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gisaid.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.gisaid.org</ext-link>) and ViPR (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.viprbrc.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.viprbrc.org</ext-link>), as well as GitHub repositories and other sources of genomic data. A suite of tools perform phylodynamic analysis (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>), including subsampling, alignment, phylogenetic inference, temporal dating of ancestral nodes and discrete trait geographic reconstruction, including inference of the most likely transmission events. This leverages the maximum likelihood analyses implemented in TreeTime (
 <xref rid="bty407-B8" ref-type="bibr">Sagulenko 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>), allowing a full analysis of the entire Ebola epidemic (

 <italic> </italic>1581 genomes) in under 2 h on a modern laptop. These scripts separate generic core functionality from a light pathogen-specific layer such that they are easily adapted to different pathogens. Visualization is available through nextstrain.org. This approach is similar in concept to Nextflu (
 <xref rid="bty407-B5" ref-type="bibr">Neher and Bedford, 2015</xref>) however extended and generalized to different viral pathogens. There is a growing need for surveillance of non-influenza viruses (
 <xref rid="bty407-B9" ref-type="bibr">Tang 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>), and Nextstrain is able to be extended to most outbreaks with readily accessible genomic data, although we note the potential for recombination or low mutation rate to confound phylogenetic signal.
