<p>Viral pathogens pose an ever-present danger to global human health, highlighted by recent events such as the West African Ebola epidemic and the ongoing Zika epidemic in the Americas. The rapid evolution of these viruses allows inference of epidemic history from genomic data. Such analyses are often done in isolation, and may lack the spatial or temporal context in which to best interpret the results (

Furthermore, the results of analyses are rarely made available to the public or health bodies until after publication, which may be too late to aid understanding or effect change in policy. We have developed Nextstrain to visualize outbreaks in as close to real time as possible. Whilst currently encompassing a selection of viruses, extension to non-viral pathogens is forthcoming.
