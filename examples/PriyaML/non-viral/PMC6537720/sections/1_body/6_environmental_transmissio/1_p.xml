<p>EIV has multiple potential direct and indirect routes of transmission and is especially communicable when it enters a large, previously unexposed population of equids. Research is clarifying the role of the environment and weather on EIV transmission. During the 2007 outbreak in Australia, wind speeds &gt;30 kph from the direction of infected horses correlated with an increased risk for infection for horses downwind (
