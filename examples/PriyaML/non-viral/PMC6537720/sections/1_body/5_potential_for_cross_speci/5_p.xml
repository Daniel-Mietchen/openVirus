<p>Humans are also a potential host for EIV. Experimental infection of antibody-negative human volunteers in the 1960s saw &gt;60% of them seroconvert and have positive virus cultures from throat swabs collected 2–6 days after nasal inoculation. Most of the human volunteers also shed virus from day 2 through day 5 but rarely shed past day 6 (

Less than 0.5% of people &lt;60 years of age had elevated antibody titers, but 11.5% of people &gt;60 years of age had elevated EIV antibodies, with &gt;40% EIV antibody elevation among people &gt;70 years of age. The authors surmised that a virus resembling the 1963 EIV strain infected humans during 1896–1900 (
