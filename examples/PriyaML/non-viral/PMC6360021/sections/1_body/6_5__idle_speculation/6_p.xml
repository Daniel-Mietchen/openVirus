<p>The issue of the defectiveness or non-defectiveness of the original Rous isolate brings up the more important question of the acquisition of cellular oncogenes by retroviruses. There have been reports of “recovered” or “rescued” sarcoma viruses [

 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] that arose after infection with a transformation-defective leukosis virus. However, in all these cases, the capture of cellular

 <xref rid="B86-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] or cellular sequences [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. These are not de novo acquisitions as they are mediated by residual 
 <italic>src</italic> sequences in the virus or retroviral sequences persisting from a previous infection adjacent to cellular
