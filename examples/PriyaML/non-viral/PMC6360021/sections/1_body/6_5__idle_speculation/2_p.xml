<p>In scenario 1, the original Rous isolate is replication-defective, lacking the envelope gene. It would have to acquire this gene to become non-defective. Although an acquisition is theoretically possible, given the high frequency of recombination between avian retroviruses, such a capture has never been observed. To detect a rare non-defective recombinant, it would be necessary to screen hundreds and possibly thousands of cell clones transformed by a single viral particle. It is unlikely for such a recombinant to become the prevalent component of an RSV stock, as defective viruses with their small genomes tend to have a selective advantage, because they replicate faster. Yet, in the non-defective avian sarcoma viruses, the non-defective component is prevalent.</p>
