This resulted in important insights into retroviral genetics. It provided the first biochemical evidence that a viral oncogene is not required for viral replication. It yielded a series of conditional and non-conditional mutants that illuminated viral gene functions and served as building blocks to construct a genetic map of a simple retrovirus. The non-defective avian sarcoma viruses led to the discovery of transformation-defective derivatives, and an isogenic pair of non-defective and transformation-defective viruses yielded a
