<p>Using the focus assay, Temin followed up on a hypothetical analogy between RSV and lysogenic phage [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. He studied cell foci transformed by a single particle of the Bryan high-titer strain and discovered foci that did not release a detectable infectious virus [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hanafusa carried out an extensive analysis of this non-producing state, and the conclusion of these studies was that the Bryan high-titer strain of RSV was defective in replication, requiring the assistance of a helper virus to generate infectious progeny [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The replication defectiveness of the Bryan high-titer strain also led to the broader conclusion that virus production was not required for oncogenic transformation. However, that extrapolation was soon challenged by electron-microscopic observations that showed the release of virus particles from non-producer cells and the recovery of infectious virus from non-producing cultures [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Most of the virus synthesized by non-producer cells turned out to carry a novel surface glycoprotein provided by an endogenous avian leukosis virus that acted as a helper virus. The corresponding cell surface receptor encoded by the S1 allele of the

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was not present on the chicken “non-producer” cells, making the virus undetectable in the standard assay [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, this subgroup E envelope protein readily mediated entry into cells of the Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica. The virus released from chicken “non-producer” cells is fully infectious and capable of reproducing in quail cell cultures. Scheele and Hanafusa precisely defined the genetic defect in the Bryan high-titer strain of RSV by showing that the viral genome lacks genetic information for the envelope protein. This information is provided by the helper virus [
