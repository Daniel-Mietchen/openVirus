<p>The genome of the Schmidtâ€“Ruppin strain of RSV has been re-engineered into a widely used and exceptionally efficient vector, referred to as RCAS, that can be used to express high levels of any protein in avian cells [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. RCAS retains the unique features of non-defective avian sarcoma viruses: active replication and spreading to adjacent cells and expression of an inserted gene. The efficiency of the initial DNA transfection that often limits the utility of expression vectors does not affect outcome with RCAS, because this expression vector is a complete retrovirus that replicates and eventually will infect every avian cell in the culture. There is also a replication-defective version of RCAS, derived from the Bryan high-titer strain of RSV. It is dependent on an avian leukosis helper virus which allows easy changes in the envelope protein and thus its host range. The RCAS vector tool has been adapted in a limited way to mammalian cells that are engineered to express the avian retroviral receptor TVA. An RCAS version with a broader host range in mammalian cells uses the envelope gene of a mouse retrovirus [
