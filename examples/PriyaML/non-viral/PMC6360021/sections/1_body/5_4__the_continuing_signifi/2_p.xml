<p>Replication-defective, acutely oncogenic retroviruses were identified repeatedly in spontaneous tumors in avian and mammalian species and led to the discovery of new oncogenes. Among the avian viruses, an early example is 
 <italic>myc</italic>, first discovered in avian myelocytomatosis virus MC29 [

 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The oncogene 
 <italic>jun</italic>, identified in the genome of avian sarcoma virus 17, showed the importance of transcriptional regulation in oncogenesis [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The catalytic isoform of PI 3-kinase drives tumor formation by avian sarcoma virus 16 [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and plays a major role in human cancer [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The genomes of several acutely oncogenic mammalian retroviruses have also yielded important oncogenes, most notably 
 <italic>abl</italic>, 
 <italic>ras</italic>, 
 <italic>raf</italic>, 
 <italic>fos</italic>, and 
 <italic>kit</italic> [
