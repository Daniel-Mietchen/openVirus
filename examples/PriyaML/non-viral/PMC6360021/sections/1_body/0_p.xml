<p>At the beginning of experimental tumor virology stands a new technique: the focus assay for Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00080" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It transformed tumor virology into a cell culture-based science. This assay provided the technical framework for a strategy adopted from phage research which included a reductionist approach and quantitation rather than description. It also led to an emphasis on work with single cells and single virus particles. These were novel and groundbreaking ideas which were quickly applied to a broad spectrum of tumor viruses, including an increasing number of cancer-causing viruses identified in mammals [
