<p id="par0285">As part of the licensing process, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency requires a minimum of 15 days of observations from water current meters located at the sea surface, cage-bottom and bed of a proposed fish farm site in order to model the deposition footprint of a new or modified site. These data contain observations at varying time intervals (
 <italic>t</italic>) between 10 and 20 min with observations of current direction (
 <italic>D</italic>) and speed 
 <italic>S</italic> (ms
 <sup>−1</sup>) for each recording event. Fish farms are primarily located at the sea surface, therefore only the sea surface observations are utilised in the simplified modelling procedure. The farms have been licensed over a 30 year period and some of the records are missing. Of the 213 sites stocking fish in 2011, 35 required simulated data to be substituted. The simulation data is drawn from the Scottish Shelf Model (
