<p id="par0300">The location (northing (
 <italic>Y</italic>) and easting (
 <italic>X</italic>)) of each farm in Scotland is detailed in SAW allowing for a grid release position for all sites in Scotland. For each of the 213 farms, simulations were undertaken. Each simulation involved 1000 iterations whereby 1000 starting time points were randomly selected from the observational dataset of 
 <italic>D</italic> and 
 <italic>S</italic> taken at each farm. As
