 <caption>
  <p>Plot of the British salmonid aquaculture industry live fish movement networks for salmon (top), and trout (bottom) species groups. Nodes in the Marine Scotland network are blue and nodes in the Cefas network red. Node size is proportional to the log of the number of connections. Node color scales to white depending on proportion of connections for which node is the source (i.e. white = source, full color = sink). Links have the colour of the source node. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).</p>
