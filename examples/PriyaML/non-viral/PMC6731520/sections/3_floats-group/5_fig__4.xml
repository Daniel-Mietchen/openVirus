  <p>Impact on expected out-component size, EOR, of removing an increasing number of highly connected nodes from the transport layer. Nodes are selected at each step by ordering according to different criteria as defined in the Methods section: by degree in (green), degree out (red), or betweenness (blue), calculated on either the transport network layer (dashed line) or the full network (solid line). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).</p>
