<p id="par0250">This analysis is, to our knowledge, the first to assess the extent and relative importance of cross-border live fish movements within GB, although this has previously been highlighted in the context of BKD outbreaks that have affected farms on both sides of the border (
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have also focused on the network of live fish movements, and not included the multiple network layers considered here. Our findings are consistent with previous studies on infection routes for spread of fish diseases (
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2010</xref>), in that the movement of live fish has the largest potential for spreading pathogens over long distances. This makes it the prime target for controlling disease spread, and fortunately, it is also the most amenable to controls. Movement restrictions have long been applied to prevent the spread of aquatic animal pathogens, dating back to the Diseases of Fish Act of 1937. An understanding of network structure has the potential to inform targeted surveillance to increase the efficiency of prevention and control strategies (

 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Enright and Kao, 2018</xref>) as part of a policy of risk-based surveillance (
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">St√§rk et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, our results show that large outbreaks are only possible when there is movement of live fish because the transport network is needed to make the network well-connected (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Without this, the extreme upper bound on outbreak size is 79 sites, although real outbreak sizes would be much smaller. A direct consequence is that an island-wide stoppage of live fish movements would isolate any outbreak to a handful of sites; however this would not be feasible in most cases as it would have more of an impact on the industry than the disease itself. Targeted movement controls, as per current policy (
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Anonymous, 2009a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), are also potentially very effective but rely on rapid identification of infected sites and contact tracing.
