<p id="par0245">From a management perspective, responsibility for the control of serious diseases in aquatic animals in GB is divided into Scotland (MSS), and England &amp; Wales (Cefas). Our results demonstrate the essential interconnectedness of these two administrative regions via the transport layer alone. A total of 7.2% of all live fish movement events go across the border, the vast majority of which are trout (93%). Furthermore, via the transport network alone, 87% of Cefas network nodes and 72% of MSS network nodes are reachable from cross-border connections. The importance of cross-border linkages demonstrated here underlines the need for a coherent approach to tracking live fish movements in GB.</p>
