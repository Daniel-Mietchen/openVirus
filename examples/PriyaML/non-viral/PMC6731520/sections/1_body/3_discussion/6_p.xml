<p id="par0260">Our network analysis has revealed that there is relatively low risk of widespread epidemics on the transport network in isolation: as a measure of the expected size of an outbreak based on network properties alone, introduction of disease into a randomly-selected node on the network puts, on average, a relatively small proportion (3%) - of nodes at risk via transport links. However, the addition of other network layers increases this to over a fifth of the network nodes (21%). Interestingly, while fish farms dominate the network of potential disease transmission via the transport links, in the full multi-layer network, non-farm sites play a major role.</p>
