<p id="par0265">As discussed in the methods section, a number of assumptions were made when reconciling the two databases in order to account for the type of data recorded. We ignored potential transmission links upstream in rivers by upstream migration of wild fish and farm escapees. In Scotland, only movements recorded at both source and destination sites were included. These assumptions could lead to a conservative estimate of potential pathogen spread. Other assumptions may have overestimated the potential for transmission in a real outbreak: for example, our simple treatment of the potential for transmission locally up to a cut-off of 3â€‰km ignores the anticipated decrease of transmission probability with distance as employed in diffusion kernel models (
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Jonkers et al., 2010</xref>). We considered the network as static, ignoring both the temporal pattern of fish movements and the dynamics of disease transmission, which is pathogen-specific. The analysis of network components gives conclusions on the potential for large outbreaks and how the network layers can combine to enable this. In this sense it represents a worst case scenario or statement of possibility. A more realistic assessment of the likely size of an outbreak and the potential effectiveness of control measures requires dynamic simulation of infectious disease transmission on this network.
