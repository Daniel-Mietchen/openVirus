<p id="par0240">We constructed the first island-wide representation of the structure of GBâ€™s salmonid aquaculture industry, assimilating data covering England and Wales with data covering Scotland, representing a snapshot of the industry circa 2011. This is a comprehensive representation of the salmon and trout fish farms and fisheries of GB, overlaid with a detailed multi-layer network mapping of the potential routes of infectious disease transmission. These layers are live fish movement, transmission along rivers, transmission in the local area around sites, as well as diffusion and transport in the marine environment.</p>
