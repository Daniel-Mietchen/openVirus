<p id="par0205">Combining all link type layers results in a highly complex network (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Supplementary Table B4 describes the distribution of link distances by type. Live fish movements span the longest distances by far (mean of 90.1 km). The next longest are river links (mean of 19.7 km), followed by marine links (mean of 3.9 km). Local links are constrained by the modelled cut-off at 3 km. The longest link in the network is a cross-border transport spanning 793 km. Links between the Cefas and the MSS networks are found only in the transport layer.
