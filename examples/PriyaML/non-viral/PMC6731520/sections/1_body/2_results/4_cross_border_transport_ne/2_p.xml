<p id="par0185">Collated cross-border transports for the years 2009–2011 yielded number of links per species group and destination type, summarised in supplementary Table B3a. These involve 143 unique nodes in England and 59 in Scotland (total node numbers are in supplementary Tables E1 and S1a respectively). The total number of border-crossing connections (287) represents 5.5% of the network’s total transport infrastructure. When added to each agency’s accountable transport network, they represent 8.0% of Cefas-administered transport links, and 14.7% of MSS-administered transport links. Another notable feature is the dominance of trout links in both directions (243 links out of 287, or 85%). There are 150 cross-border links from England and Wales to Scotland, with 813 transports, and 137 cross-border links from Scotland to England and Wales, with 1164 transports.</p>
