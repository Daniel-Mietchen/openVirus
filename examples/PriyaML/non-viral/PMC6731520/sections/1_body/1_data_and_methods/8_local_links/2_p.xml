<p id="par0110">We defined bi-directional local links, representing fomite transmission via animal vectors such as eels and piscivorous birds, as existing between all sites within a 3 km radius. This distance threshold was based on an existing epidemiological simulator for aquaculture disease (
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Jonkers et al., 2010</xref>), which uses a two-dimensional Gaussian diffusion kernel for which transmission likelihood drops steeply with radial distance from the source, reaching half of its maximum at 833 m and is effectively zero at 3 km.
