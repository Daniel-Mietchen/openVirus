<p id="par0050">Live fish movement data was provided by Cefas and MSS for England and Wales (2011–2013) and Scotland (2009–2011) respectively. Geographically, our analysis is confined to GB (England, Scotland, and Wales, including their component islands), excluding the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, and Northern Ireland. GB and the island of Ireland are considered as separate epidemiological units (
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">Yatabe et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">Wiens, 2011</xref>) and therefore Northern Island is excluded from the network analysis. This separation is supported by considering pathogen distribution; salmonid BKD is widespread in GB but absent from Ireland (

 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, GB’s aquaculture industries are free of several notifiable pathogens which are widespread in much of continental Europe including infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), ISAV (but not HPR0 variant) and the monogenean parasite

 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Dalgaard et al., 2004</xref>). GB is therefore a reasonably self-contained epidemiological unit suitable for analysis.
