Section 30 farm-to-fishery transports required individual approval specifying species being moved and a dated time window (up to six weeks) during which one or more movements were to be carried out. By contrast, farm-to-farm transports are dated only by year, and records do not include species. As fish transports are by definition group-specific in our network reconstruction, this information was inferred based on the species group being stocked by the farms concerned.
