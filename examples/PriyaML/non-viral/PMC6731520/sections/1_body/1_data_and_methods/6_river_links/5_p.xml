<p id="par0100">Cross-border links are possible via two rivers, the (Cumbria) Esk and the Tweed, which straddle the England-Scotland border. However, aquaculture in the Esk catchment falls entirely under the jurisdiction of Cefas, whereas MSS is responsible for the entire Tweed catchment, and hence our analysis of cross-border links consider only those within the transport network layer.</p>
