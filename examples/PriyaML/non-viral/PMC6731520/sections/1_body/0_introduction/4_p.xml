Statutory responsibilities are delivered by Fish Health Inspectorates owned respectively by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) in England and Wales; and by Marine Scotland Science (MSS) in Scotland. Despite the connectivity of these two administrative regions via the transport of live fish, to date there has been no comprehensive study of the combined network. Here we describe the first unified framework of Great Britainâ€™s (GB) salmonid aquaculture industry to provide a foundation for basic network analysis and epidemiological outbreak simulations.
