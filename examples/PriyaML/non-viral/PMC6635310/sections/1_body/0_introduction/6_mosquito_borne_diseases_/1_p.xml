<p>After flooding, mosquito borne diseases for example dengue fever, especially in endemic areas, can increase. Standing water after overflow of the rivers could act as the breeding sites for mosquitos. Therefore vector borne diseases have long-term impacts on public health (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In the flooding in northern Peru in 2017, outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue fever with more than 19000 suspected cases of dengue fever were reported (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Outbreaks of WNF after flooding occurred in Italy in 1998, Czech Republic in 1997 and Romania in 1996–97 (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In a flood in Punjab/Pakistan in 2010, 21204 people were reported with dengue fever (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Again in 2011–2013 dengue infections were reported after flooding which in Karachi, 700, 858, 630 and 2700 deaths related to dengue fever were identified in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Rift Valley fever (RVF) is another mosquito borne disease with the possibility of causing outbreak after flooding. Many studies in Kenya reported outbreaks of RVF after high rainfall and flooding (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Anyamba et al. reported RVF in late 1957, 1982 and mid 1989 after a rainfall in Kenya (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The largest outbreak of RVF happened after El Nino flood in 1997/98 in Kenya which lead to 89000 infections with 0.5 % mortality (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In 2006, in another flooding in Kenya, RVF outbreaks were reported (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In 2007 in Sudan, RVF outbreak occurred with 747 confirmed cases including 230 deaths (mortality rate 30.8%) (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In a study by Hubalek Z et al. in Czech Republic, specimens from people affected by the 2002 flood were tested serologically for mosquito borne viruses. Antibodies were detected against Batai (0.2%), Sindbis (1%), and Tahyna (16%) viruses, but not WNV. Paired serum samples showed one Tahyna bunyavirus infection (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). A study in Brisbane, Australia showed that increases in the high tide and rainfall in one month were considerably associated with the rise of monthly Ross River virus incidence (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is endemicin 23 of 30 provinces of Iran; Sistan-Baluchestan, Isfahan, Fars, and Khuzestan are the most highly infected provinces respectively. In a study by Sharififard et al. two peaks of CCHF infections reported in Khuzestan, during 1999 - 2015 (in 2003 and 2010) (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In another study by Sedaghat et al. CCHFV was found in 5.3% of the ticks collected in Golestan province during 2014–15 (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Pourmahdi Borujeni et al. showed the existence of WNV infection in Khuzestan (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In a research in Mahshahr strict, Khuzestan, some vectors of human and animal pathogens were identified (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). A study (2008–2014) has reported 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> in southern Iran (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The species 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> is well-known for transmitting chikungunya and dengue viruses. In another research, 
 <italic>Aedes unilineatus</italic> was also recognized in the southeast of Iran (2012–2014). This mosquito species has been identified as a dengue vector in Karachi, Pakistan (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). These findings support establishment of dengue vectors in this region. Based on the different distribution of vectors, there is the possibility of re-emergence of related diseases in Khuzestan and Golestan provinces after flooding.
