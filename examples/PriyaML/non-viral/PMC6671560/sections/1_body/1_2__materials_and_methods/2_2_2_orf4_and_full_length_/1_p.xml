<p>ORF4 sequences (720 nt) of eighty isolates collected between 1989 and 2010 in Madagascar were retrieved from NCBI GenBank (
 <xref rid="vez023-B57" ref-type="bibr">Rakotomalala et al. 2013</xref>). Additionally, ORF4 sequences of fourteen Malagasy isolates, collected in 2014 and in 2017, were newly generated as described previously (
 <xref rid="vez023-B52" ref-type="bibr">Pinel et al. 2000</xref>) and deposited at NCBI GenBank under the accession numbers

All Malagasy isolates were annotated with the date (year) and location (latitude and longitude) of sampling. The ninety-four aligned ORF4 sequences are referred to as the Mg94 dataset.
