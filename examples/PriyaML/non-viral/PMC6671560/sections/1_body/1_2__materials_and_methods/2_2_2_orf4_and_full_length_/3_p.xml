<p>The full-length genome dataset was assembled by retrieving the publicly available sequences from NCBI GenBank (28 December 2018). The dataset consists of thirty sequences, twenty-four from East Africa, and six from Madagascar. Compared to the twenty-two taxon full-length dataset used in earlier studies (
 <xref rid="vez023-B50" ref-type="bibr">Ochola et al. 2015</xref>), this updated dataset included two additional full-length sequences of the S4-Ug strain found in western Kenya (
 <xref rid="vez023-B3" ref-type="bibr">Adego et al. 2018</xref>), one sequence from the S4-Lv strain (
 <xref rid="vez023-B3" ref-type="bibr">Adego et al. 2018</xref>), and five sequences of isolates of three recently identified strains: two sequences of the S4-Et strain from Ethiopia (
 <xref rid="vez023-B58" ref-type="bibr">Rakotomalala et al. 2014</xref>), two of the S4-Ke strain from Kenya (
 <xref rid="vez023-B3" ref-type="bibr">Adego et al. 2018</xref>), and one S7 sequence from Malawi (
 <xref rid="vez023-B48" ref-type="bibr">Ndikumana et al. 2017</xref>).
