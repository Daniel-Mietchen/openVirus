<p>The six sequences of RYMV Madagascar belonged to a monophyletic clade with a high branch support whatever the genome segment considered (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The virus diversity estimated from the ORF4 sequences of ninety-four isolates from Madagascar (600,000 km
 <sup>2</sup>) was lower than that in other rice producing countries of East and West Africa estimated from a comparable subset of sequences sampled at the a similar spatial scale. The average pairwise distance is 1.6 per cent for the Madagascar vs. 3.3 per cent in Ivory Coast (fifty-one isolates; 320,000 km
 <sup>2</sup>), 4.3 per cent in Mali (forty-one isolates; 1,240,000 km
 <sup>2</sup>, but rice is cultivated in the southern half of the country only), and 8.3 per cent in Tanzania (154 isolates; 950,000 km
 <sup>2</sup>).
