<p>Analyses of ORF4 sequences from isolates collected since 1966 revealed that RYMV is a fast-evolving pathogen (
 <xref rid="vez023-B26" ref-type="bibr">Fargette et al. 2008</xref>). This implies that samples collected over the last few decades may contain information about recent evolutionary dynamics. Such temporally spaced sequence data can, however, only reliably inform evolutionary rate estimates if genetic divergence over the sampling time range, or the so-called temporal signal, can be identified and statistically supported (
 <xref rid="vez023-B22" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al. 2003</xref>), and it is now well-recognized that this assumption should be thoroughly tested in order to avoid spurious results (

How accurately the spatial patterns of spread can be recovered by phylogeographic methods, on the other hand, remains challenging to evaluate. Recently, key aspects of the phylogeography of RYMV have tentatively been linked to the spatially heterogeneous and rapidly changing rice cultivation in mainland Africa (
