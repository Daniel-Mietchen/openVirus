<p>Due to its economic importance, rice in Madagascar has been subjected to regular phytosanitary surveys, more frequent and comprehensive than in most countries of continental Africa. The first reports of RYMV symptoms by farmers and agricultural advisers date back to the 1970s. In several instances, leaf samples with symptoms were kept dried for years and were found positive a decade later when the first serological tests became available (S. Randrianangaly, unpublished data). By the 1980s, plant pathologists conducted regular surveys throughout the country. Since the 1990s, RYMV presence was not only assessed through symptom expression, but also after mechanical inoculation of susceptible cultivars or by serological agar-gel double-diffusion tests (

Serological or molecular tests have shown that RYMV is not detected in symptom-free plants, even those collected close to or alongside infected plants. Together, these surveys provide reliable information on the presence/absence of the virus in the visited fields. Results of the field surveys are accessible in scientific journals (
