<p>Reads obtained from each library were trimmed employing the trimmomatic tool [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] (parameters (TRAILING: 30, HEADCROP:5) followed by quality check analysis by FASTQC (

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in order to obtain the geminivirus-related reads. All filtered libraries were subjected to de novo assembly using SPAdes [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]; both contigs (â‰¥78 bp) and unassembled reads were compared against the GeneBank non-redundant database using BLASTn hosted in the Galaxy server [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Geminivirus-related signatures were sorted by contig length and analyzed manually. Contigs obtained in the present study are available at:
