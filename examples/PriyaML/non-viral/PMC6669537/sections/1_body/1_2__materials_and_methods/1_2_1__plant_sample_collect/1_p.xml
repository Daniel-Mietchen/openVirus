<p>A total of 422 non-cultivated plants (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) located in the area between crops and wild vegetation zones (agro-ecological interface), in seven states in the northern-pacific region of Mexico during the period 2012–2016, were collected, GPS-documented, photographed, and identified to the species level. Thus, 132 species of plants belonging to 34 families were identified. The sampling regions were grouped as follows: (1) Baja California (BC), (2) Sonora (SO), (3) Sinaloa (SI), (4) Colima-Nayarit (CN), and (5) Coahuila-Durango (CD) states of Mexico. Samples were placed on ice and brought to the laboratory and stored at −80 °C until processed. Plants were collected in non-protected areas; additionally, an herbarium was established with most of the plant specimens.</p>
