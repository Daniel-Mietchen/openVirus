<p>Total DNA was extracted from individual plants using the CTAB method [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and the isolated DNA, upon spectrophotometric estimation of its concentration, was used as template for PCR-based 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic> detection using degenerate universal primers (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00594">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). For each sampling region, total DNA from 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic> PCR-positive plants, belonging to the same plant species, was mixed in equimolar concentration. Following this procedure, 100 ng of each DNA mixture was used for circular DNA-molecule enrichment by rolling circle amplification (RCA) using the illustra TempliPhi DNA Amplification Kit (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, MA, USA), following the manufacturer´s instructions. Then, all RCA products obtained per sampling region were pooled in equimolar concentrations, and cleaned using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1)/potassium acetate (5 M) and 100 ethanol % precipitation (1/10 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, 1/2 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, respectively). DNA integrity was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the cleaned RCA mixtures were used for NGS library construction that was sequenced by a commercial facility (LANGEBIO, Irapuato, GTO, MX) using Illumina Nextera XT paired end 2 × 150 bp protocol on a MiSeq 500. The same procedure was followed for each sampling region to obtain one library per region (for a total of five libraries).
