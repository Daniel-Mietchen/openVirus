<p>The current next generation sequence (NGS) technologies have a couple of drawbacks: firstly, the contigs/singletons need to be annotated 
 <italic>de novo</italic> via short read assembly, a process that may create chimeras deriving from the different genomes present in a sample, and secondly, the accurate differentiation of sequences; thus, confirmation is required by cloning followed by Sanger sequencing. The hope is that the latest single-molecule NGS technologies (3rd generation), where long reads are obtained, could address both of the above-mentioned issues, especially when their sequence reading error rates drop significantly compared to the levels of the previous NGS technologies. The resolution of the metagenome of a given sample could identify genetic variations in a viral population, providing the necessary input to study viral genome evolution, and determine which environmental factors might influence the generation of novel plant pathogens from previously benign viruses.
