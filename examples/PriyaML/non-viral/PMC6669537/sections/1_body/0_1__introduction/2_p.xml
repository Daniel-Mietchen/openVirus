<p>Plant diseases caused by begomoviruses and RNA viruses have been the main concern in Mexican horticulture throughout the years, having a significant negative impact on the crop production of tomato, pepper, bean, pumpkin, melon, soybean, tomatillo, tobacco, watermelon, and cotton [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Begomoviruses (family 
 <italic>Geminiviridae</italic>) are characterized by their geminate particles that encapsidate a circular single-stranded (ss) DNA genome (monopartite or bipartite) of about 2.8 kb in size. They are transmitted via whitefly (
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>), infecting a large number of plant species worldwide and causing serious crop losses, and constitute a major global threat [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Important diseases caused by geminiviruses include maize streak disease [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], cassava mosaic disease [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], cotton leaf curl disease [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and tomato leaf curl disease [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Mexico, the first report of a disease caused in tomato by geminiviruses came from the Sinaloa state in 1970, and was later designated as 
 <italic>Chino del tomato virus</italic> (CdTV) [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the first serious disease was reported in pepper crops and was named “rizado amarillo”, identified as the coinfection with 
 <italic>Pepper huasteco yellow vein virus</italic> (PHYVV) and 
 <italic>Pepper golden mosaic virus</italic> (PepGMV) [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recently, the introduction of 
 <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> (TYLCV) in Sinaloa has dealt a devastating impact on tomato production. In different agro-climatic regions of Mexico, begomovirus-associated diseases are commonly caused by mixed infections with diverse begomoviruses, and affect tomato and pepper crops [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Coinfections with begomoviruses adapted to non-cultivated plants together with crop-adapted begomoviruses have been reported in soybean, tobacco, and pepper plants in the Sinaloa, Chiapas, and Jalisco states of Mexico [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Geminiviruses exhibit high mutation rates and recombination frequencies, both within and between species, resulting in rapid adaptive evolution. Several reports have indicated the emergence of recombinant species of geminiviruses [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl Malaga virus</italic> (TYLMaV) is a recombinant of 
 <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus</italic> (TYLCSV) and 
 <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> mild strain (TYLCV) which, unlike its “parental” genomes, has the ability to infect common bean and wild 
 <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. More importantly, TYLMaV accumulated to the same levels in susceptible and resistant tomato, indicating that the recombination event and subsequent selection led to the generation of a resistance-breaking isolate [
