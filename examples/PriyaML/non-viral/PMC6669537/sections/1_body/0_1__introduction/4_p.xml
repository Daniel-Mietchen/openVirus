<p>New mutant or recombinant viral genomes that have arisen in non-cultivated plants could achieve successful infection of plant hosts to which they have newly adapted and cause significant crop damage, in a process subject to effective transmission between plant species. Vector-transmission is an evolutionary barrier for plant viruses to expand their host range. Alterations in vector-dependent transmission, most likely through mutations in the viral coat protein sequences, could increase the risk of emergence of a plant pathogen in a given crop. Begomoviruses are transmitted by the whitefly

Vector metagenomics could contribute to surveying the diversity of geminiviruses present in their insect vectors and to defining the corresponding coat protein sequences. Although coat proteins have a structural role for the viral capsid, CP gene sequences are known to diverge [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] due to a high mutation rate. In addition, it is possible that such CP mutations could facilitate new means of transmission, such as seed transmission. Therefore, it is important to study the complexity and heterogeneity of geminiviral quasipecies found in wild reservoir hosts, and understand the factors behind the observed genetic variation since such knowledge will be extremely useful to develop resistance strategies (e.g., RNAi-based approaches) and, as a consequence, to prevent crop losses.
