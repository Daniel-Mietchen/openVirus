<p>Plant viruses have generally been studied as disease-causing infectious agents that have a negative impact on their hosts [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Considering the wide diversity of geminiviruses, non-cultivated plants may serve as reservoirs for known, agriculturally relevant viruses: such weed-hosted viral species hold great potential to initiate the future emergence of new diseases in cultivated plants [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. To determine begomoviral diversity in Northern-Pacific Mexico, a survey was performed in the agro-ecological interface in the vicinity of crop sites during 2012–2016. Sampling areas were divided in five regions: Baja California, Sonora, Sinaloa, Colima-Nayarit, and Coahulia-Durango, with three, four, seven, two, and four sampling points, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00594-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). A total of 422 non-cultivated plants (both symptomatic and asymptomatic), belonging to 34 families and 132 species were identified (

 <italic>Astaraceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Malvaceae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Fabaceae</italic>. It is worth mentioning that those families were found to be the most predominant in natural ecosystems considering 200 plant families described in Mexico [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Using degenerate universal primers based on the DNA A genome of the genus 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic>, we were able to amplify the expected DNA fragment of 950–1100 bp in 252 out of the 422 (60%) tested individual plant specimens, indicating that begomoviruses were present in 29 plant families collected from all five regions sampled (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00594-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that a number of non-cultivated plants widely distributed in Northern-Pacific Mexico represent a reservoir for begomoviruses.
