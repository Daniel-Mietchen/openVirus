<p>It is an accepted notion that global warming will have an impact on global food security. In particular, crop yields are predicted to significantly decrease considering the “worst” CO
 <sub>2</sub>-emission scenario (A1FI) put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], imposing negative, neutral or positive effects on yields depending on the host-pathogen-environment tripartite interaction (known as the ‘disease triangle’). Disease pattern changes are anticipated due to alterations in the host range of plant pathogens, especially in rapidly evolving pathogens, while disease severity will be influenced by increased CO
 <sub>2</sub>, heavy rains, increased humidity, drought, and warmer winter temperatures [

Studies towards the understanding of the existing genetic diversity of plant viruses occurring in the agro-ecological interface, the generation of new genomes with features advantageous to the pathogen, and the relationship with their corresponding vectors will contribute significantly to humankind’s preparation to adapt to climate change and to sustain future food production. In this study, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was employed to determine begomoviral diversity in plant samples collected in Northern-Pacific Mexico.
