<p>Clone LV15-Ng-04 (Accession number: MK643155) from 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> was 2781 nt in length and showed high nucleotide homology (99.9%) to TYLCV (Accession number: EF523478.1). Clones LV15-Sa-03 and LV15-Sa-02 (Accession numbers: MK636866, and MK643154), from 
 <italic>S. acuta</italic>, were 2611 nt and 2583 nt in length and showed nucleotide homology of 95.1 and 91.3% with DNA-A and DNA-B of SiMSiV (Accession numbers: DQ520944.1, and DQ356428.1, respectively). Clones LV17-Rm-02 LV17-Rm-06 (Accession numbers: MK634355, and MK634539), from 
 <italic>R. minima</italic>, were 2605 nt and 2568 nt in length and showed nucleotide homology of 98.6 and 91% with DNA-A and DNA-B of RhGMV (Accession numbers: EU339939.1, and DQ356429.1, respectively). Finally, clones LV15-Rm-02 LV15-Rm-08 (Accession numbers: MK618662, and MK618663), from 
 <italic>R. minima</italic>, were 2578 nt and 2525 nt in length and showed nucleotide homology of 91.9 and 85.9% with DNA-A and DNA-B of RhGMSV (Accession numbers: DQ406672.1, and DQ406673.1, respectively). For all viral genomes obtained, the predicted stem-loop region containing the sequence TAATATTAC, found in the common region of family 
 <italic>Geminiviridae</italic>, was identified. For bipartite begomoviruses, high nucleotide homology of the common region (CR), of 98, 91, and 87% (DNA-A versus DNA-B) was observed for SiMSiV, RhGMV, and RhGMSV, respectively. Furthermore, the array of regulatory elements (iterons and TATA boxes) was conserved in all cases, suggesting that corresponding DNA-A and DNB-B are cognates. According to the present taxonomic classification of ICTV [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], for family 
 <italic>Geminiviridae</italic>, the clones of TYLCV, SiMSiV, and RhGMV obtained in this study are classified as strains (≥94% DNA-A nucleotide homology), whereas the RhGMSV clones are classified as different isolates (≥91% DNA-A nucleotide homology).
