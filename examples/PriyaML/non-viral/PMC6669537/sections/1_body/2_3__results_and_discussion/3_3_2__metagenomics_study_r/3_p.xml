<p>The analysis of the highest geminivirus-related signature sequences revealed a list of both bipartite and monopartite begomoviruses, including crop-adapted viruses in different plant families; 14 with bipartite genomes such as 
 <italic>Pepper huasteco yellow vein virus</italic> (PHYVV-signature) present in four regions, 
 <italic>Pepper golden mosaic virus</italic> (PepGMV-signature) present in four regions, 
 <italic>Pepper leafroll virus</italic> (PepLRV-signature) present in one region, 
 <italic>Tomato chino la Paz virus</italic> (ToChLPV-signature) present in two regions, 
 <italic>Tomato severe leaf curl virus</italic> (ToSLCV-signature) present in two regions, 
 <italic>Tomato yellow spot virus</italic> (ToYSV) present in three regions, 
 <italic>Potato yellow mosaic virus</italic> (PYMV) present in one region, 
 <italic>Okra yellow mosaic mottle virus</italic> (OYMMV-signature) present in four regions, 
 <italic>Cabbage leaf curl virus</italic> (CabLCV-signature) present in two regions, 
 <italic>Bean calico mosaic virus</italic> (BCaMV-signature) present in four regions, 
 <italic>Bean yellow mosaic Mexico virus</italic> (BYMMV-signature) present in one region, 
 <italic>Vigna yellow mosaic virus</italic> (ViYMV-signature) present in two regions, 
 <italic>Water melon chlorotic stunt virus</italic> (WmCSV-signature) present in one region and 
 <italic>Squash leaf curl virus</italic> (SLCV-signature) present in three regions; and five with monopartite genomes, three belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic>, namely 
 <italic>Chilli leaf curl virus</italic> (ChiLCV-signature) present in one region, and 
 <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> (TYLCV-signature) present in four regions, 
 <italic>Sweet potato leaf curl virus</italic> (SPLCV-signature) present in one region; additionally, one belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Curtovirus</italic>, namely 
 <italic>Beet curly top virus</italic> (BCTV-signature) and another belonging to genus 
 <italic>Topocovirus</italic>, namely 
 <italic>Tomato pseudo-curly top virus</italic> (TPCTV), both present in one region (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00594-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Furthermore, nine non-cultivated plant-adapted viruses included only begomoviruses with bipartite genomes such as 
 <italic>Solanum mosaic Bolivia virus</italic> (SoMBoV-signature), present in two regions, 
 <italic>Sida mosaic Sinaloa virus</italic> (SiMSiV-signature) present in five regions, 
 <italic>Sida golden yellow spot virus</italic> (SiGYSV-singnature) present in one region, 
 <italic>Malvastrum bright yellow mosaic virus</italic> (MaBYMV-signature) present in three region, 
 <italic>Rhyncosia golden mosaic virus</italic> (RhGMV-signature) present in five regions, and 
 <italic>Rhyncosia golden mosaic Sinaloa virus</italic> (RhGMSV-signature) present in two regions, 
 <italic>Euphorbia mosaic virus</italic> (EuMV-signature) present in three regions, 
 <italic>Euphorbia yellow mosaic virus</italic> (EuYMV) present in one region and 
 <italic>Blechum leaf curl virus</italic> (BlelCV-signature) present in one region, (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00594-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, the observation of 
 <italic>Tomato pseudo-curly top virus</italic> (TPCTV) in samples from Colima-Nayarit is the first report of the genus 
 <italic>Topocovirus</italic> in Mexico. The list of geminiviruses are grouped as a potential of new viruses or strain of the best match virus, with molecular and biological validation being necessary.
