<p>The de novo assembly of geminivirus-related reads resulted in 24,289 geminivirus-related contigs ranging from 78 to 2858 bp in length (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00594-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The generated contigs were used to search the NCBI-GenBank database in order to identify the most closely related geminivirus exemplars at the species level (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00594">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00594-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows all geminivirus-related signatures ≥300 bp and with at least 80% similarity at the nucleotide level with the best match, regardless whether DNA A or B viral components were detected. Similar findings were described in a metagenomics analysis in whiteflies, in which only one DNA component of a bipartite begomovirus was retrieved [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-11-00594" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Additionally, the geminivirus-related signatures with 100–300 bp and/or below &lt;80% similarity at the nucleotide level with the best match in NCBI gene sequences are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00594">Supplementary Table S2</xref>. It is important to note that short geminivirus-related signatures could hinder the correct classification of a begomovirus species or strain; nonetheless, profiling the phylogenetic composition of the viral communities is pivotal as a significant part of the different plant-virus-environment interaction.
