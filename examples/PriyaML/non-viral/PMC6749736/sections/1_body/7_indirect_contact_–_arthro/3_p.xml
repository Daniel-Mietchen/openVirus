 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2019-0058_ref_036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) demonstrated that viable ASFV is present in the bodies of flies fed infectious blood for up to 12 h and DNA could be detected there for three days post feeding. These results indicate that such flies might mechanically transmit the virus to susceptible hosts. The dose contained in only one fly, when ingested, was sufficient to develop clinical signs of the disease in a pig. Nevertheless, spatial separation is likely to constrain the stable fly vector, and transmission within a herd is considered to be more probable than transmission between farms. Therefore, occurrence of indirect transmission of the virus within distant farms
 <italic>.via</italic> ASFV-contaminated flies remains virtually impossible (

Another study verified the hypothesis whether fly larvae growing in and feeding on carcasses of infected wild boars might be involved in disease spreading. However, despite ASFV DNA presence, it was demonstrated that virus replication within larvae is absent. It was stated that although feeding by wild boars on larvae-ridden carrion was highly improbable, it could not be ruled out, although the researchers contended that blowfly larvae do not play a significant role in ASFV spreading
