<p>Along with increasing globalisation, the introduction of human and animal diseases is going to pose a continuous threat to public and livestock health, trade of animals and their products, and food security. Worldwide, the pig-farming industry is constantly growing in reply to rising demand for pork meat. Nevertheless, this branch of the economy is particularly vulnerable to production decimation because of transmission of various transboundary infectious diseases, amongst which ASF is currently causing the greatest concern. During recent years, ASFV has been spreading towards new areas; however, the most dramatic turn occurred in 2018, when the disease emerged in China, the top pig-farming nation providing half of global pig production. Due to the lack of a safe effective vaccine and the common presence of infected wild boars in particular areas, the only method to control the disease is strict biosecurity measures allied to international cooperation on this matter. Knowledge and epidemiological understanding of how the virus may be introduced into susceptible populations of pigs is crucial to provide awareness to prevent the outbreaks and detect and control them immediately and appropriately when they do occur. Therefore, identification of potential sources and pathways of transmission in regards to ASFV is exceptionally important to prevent further disease spread.</p>
