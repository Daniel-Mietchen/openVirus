<p>ASFV stability in different environmental conditions was the subject of numerous investigations, but most of them were conducted in the previous century. The virus has been identified as extremely resistant to physical treatment such as high temperatures, putrefaction and desiccation, freezing/thawing, ultrasonic waves, or extreme pH values. Low temperatures, such as the −20°C usually required to preserve pork meat, facilitate virus survival for years. Raw meat and other pork products can provide long ASFV survivability, but the temperature conditions are the main factor directly influencing virus stability. Ripening hams and dry-cured meat products may contain viable virus, nevertheless it depends greatly on the preparation and conservation techniques, which differ widely between regions and countries.</p>
