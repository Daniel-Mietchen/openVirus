<p>In reference to the disease’s transmission, it was proved that ASFV infectivity without a susceptible animal having direct contact with infected blood is rather moderate; nevertheless, transmission only
 <italic>.via</italic> air contact is still possible. Moreover, excretions and secretions are also considered infectious and they may participate in disease spread. Indirect transmission of ASFV by contaminated feed products has been shown to be possible for at least 30 days. Moreover, it was proved that oral uptake of contaminated liquid will more likely lead to infection than uptake of contaminated solid feed. A 10

 <sub>50</sub>/mL dose received with liquid is sufficient to induce clinical signs of the disease. Despite scrutiny of the preventive measures which were undertaken, the source of the disease’s introduction onto farms has remained unknown in the majority of ASFV outbreaks recently reported in Central Europe. It is suggested that arthropods like flies or ticks may act as mechanical vectors. Laboratory investigations partially confirmed this hypothesis, but infection was possible only
 <italic>.via</italic> ingestion of flies no longer than 24 h after the insects has been fed infected blood. Therefore, while involvement of such arthropods in disease spread seems to be strictly limited, it cannot be ruled out.
