<p>Several experimental studies have demonstrated that transmission
 <italic>.via</italic> contaminated feed is possible; nonetheless the knowledge is relatively poor concerning fomite-to-pig transmission (

 <italic>.et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2019-0058_ref_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) effectively infected pigs orally through solid feed contaminated with minced tissues from sick animals. Shortly thereafter it was proved that when consumed by a susceptible pig, ASFV contained in milk led to infection, but it required a relatively high virus load of 10
 <sup>5.4</sup> HAD
 <sub>50</sub>/mL (

 <italic>.in vitro</italic> study published in 2018 demonstrated that artificially ASFV-contaminated feed ingredients had viable virus pathogens for at least 30 days (

 <italic>.et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2019-0058_ref_032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) determined the minimum infectious dose of ASFV through natural oral exposure
 <italic>.via</italic> drinking and feeding behaviours. The investigation showed that as little as 10
 <sup>0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> contained in liquid is required to develop successful infection, whereas a dose of 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> is needed in solid, plant-based feed (
 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2019-0058_ref_032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Moreover, the study demonstrated that a liquid diet has a much higher infection probability compared with dried feed. The highest dose tested in liquid (104) led to infection of 100% of experimental pigs, while neither of the investigated solid feed doses showed such a high rate of infection (

 <italic>.et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2019-0058_ref_046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) in 2016 showed that feed and water contaminated by infectious blood stored at 4°C preserved ASFV viability for 30 and at least 60 days (the duration of the whole study), respectively. On the other hand, storage at room temperature resulted in far shorter ASFV survival: in feed to 1 day and in water to 50 days. Therefore, contaminated feed and water stored at 4°C might pose a risk of infection over at least 30-day and 60-day periods, respectively (
