<p>The matter of ASFV survival in products which cannot be heat-treated but are preserved through salting and drying is more complicated than in raw pork (
 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2019-0058_ref_012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The studies regarding ASFV survival in dry-cured processed meat are limited to ham, Spanish and Italian shoulder, loin, smoked pepperoni and salami, pork belly, and corned meat (

Pork belly and loin were demonstrated to still contain viable ASFV after 60 and 83 days, which is longer than the duration of their commercial curing processes (14–21 and 60 days, respectively) but still within the shelf-life of the products. These pork products pose a low potential short-term risk if in swill fed to pigs (

Ripening hams, like Iberian loin (112 days), shoulders (140 days), and Serrano and Parma (respectively 180 and 300–399 days) hams might remain infectious relatively long, but still cease to be within the duration of the curing process, which lasts much longer (

 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2019-0058_ref_028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Therefore the curing time is sufficient to inactivate ASFV and these products should be considered safe.
