<p>As the viable virus has been identified in excretions, it raises the question of how long the virus can survive in them. Montgomery (
 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2019-0058_ref_030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) showed as long ago as 1921 that when faeces are stored in the dark at room temperature they remain infective for at least 11 days, but other later studies showed that this time might be extended up to 160 days (

The most recent investigations indicated that ASFV stability in faeces is much lower than previously thought and depends largely on the temperature. Faeces collected from experimentally inoculated pigs remained infectious for 8 days at 4°C, and for 3–4 days at 37°C. When it comes to urine, it might contain viable virus for up to 15 days at 4°C, 5 days at 21°C, and 2–3 days at 37°C (
