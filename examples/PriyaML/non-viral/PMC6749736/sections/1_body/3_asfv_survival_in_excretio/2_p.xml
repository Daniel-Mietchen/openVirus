However, for the first time it was demonstrated experimentally that exposure of pigs to an environment contaminated with virus-containing excretions might result in infection. Excretions containing viable ASFV should be considered an important route for virus transmission, particularly within a herd. Moreover, as the infective dose of ASFV is small – estimated at 10
