<p>The results obtained with this additional screening procedure are provided in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Whatever the location of the index herds (breeding herds), the required number of clinical, serological and virological inspections was only slightly increased, yet the detection rate increased drastically since only 1.2â€“1.8% of the infected herds remained undetected. The impact of the screening of small production herds was more pronounced when the infection was introduced into free-range herds. Indeed, the detection rate in this case also increased from 15 to 94%. Only 6% of the simulations resulted in secondary cases, still mainly due to the local transmission route. The time to first detection was similar to the previous scenario, but the median epidemic duration was limited to 12 days [12; 27]. Due to this rapid detection and short duration of the epidemics, the number of surveillance visits was significantly lower than in the baseline scenario, with only 32 [3; 192], 2 [1; 19], and 1 [1; 3] clinical, serological, and virological inspections, respectively.
