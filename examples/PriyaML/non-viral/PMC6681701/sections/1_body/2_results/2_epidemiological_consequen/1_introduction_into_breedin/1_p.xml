<p>According to the model's outcomes, and applying the control and surveillance protocols described above, the spread of ASF among the swine production units in France was found to be relatively minor. An illustration of model behavior is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. A median number of two herds were infected throughout the simulations whatever the region of introduction, and the number of infected herds remained below eight in 95% of the simulations. On average, 33% of the simulations did not lead to any secondary infections, the infection remaining limited to the seeder herd. The percentage of undetected herds was higher when the index case was introduced in low-density areas, reaching 12% (as opposed to 6â€“7% in other areas, 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with long-distance transmission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, 75% of transmission occurrences remained in the introduction zone when the index case was located in high-density areas. This percentage fell to 40% in low-density areas and the infection spread up to 800 km away from the index location. Between 60 and 73% of transmission occurrences involved transmission from multiplier to farrow-to-finish herds. Fourteen per cent involved free-range herds when the index herd was in the lowest-density areas (zones 1 and 2), while this percentage fell to 6 and 2% when the virus was introduced into high-density areas (zones 3 and 4; data not shown).
