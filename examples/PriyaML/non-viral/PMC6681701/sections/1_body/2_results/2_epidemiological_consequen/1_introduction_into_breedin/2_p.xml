<p>Animal movements represented the major transmission route via the network, accounting for 99.4% of transmission occurrences; local transmission within a 2-km radius of infected herds accounted for 0.6% of transmission occurrences. Medium- and low-risk contacts were only sporadically involved throughout the simulation process (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The median time to first detection was evaluated as 15 days (14–21 days). The infection-to-detection time for secondary cases was shorter (11 days [3; 17]) due to the implementation of control measures after the initial detection. The average outbreak duration from introduction to disease extinction was evaluated at between 21 and 23 days, with variability ranging between 15 and 47 days. This rapid resolution was mainly achieved thanks to passive and active surveillance policies based on clinical inspections. The number of clinical, serological, and virological inspections was positively correlated with density in the area of the index case. Throughout the simulation process, the median numbers of clinical visits varied from 102 [20; 464] in low-density areas to 235 [88; 633] in high-density areas. However, the median number of serological investigations did not exceed 32 herds (high-density area), and only eight herds were subjected to virological investigations (ranges of 1–108 and 1–36, respectively, for serological and virological investigations at farm level).
