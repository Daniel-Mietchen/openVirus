<p>Transmission from index herds selected among free-range production sites was relatively rare. Only 12.5% of simulations revealed actual transmission from the index case to contact herds (87.5% with only one infected herd). When transmission occurred, the number of infected herds could reach 15, but 95% of these simulations resulted in the infection of eight herds or less. Sixty per cent of transmission occurrences involved small production herds with fewer than 80 pigs, and 37% concerned free-range herds. In contrast with previous results, local transmission was clearly identified as the major transmission route, accounting for 81% of events, whereas animal movements only represented 11% of transmissions (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Taking the whole simulation process, only 15.2% of infected herds were detected. Due to this low detection rate, which impairs the rapid implementation of control measures, and despite the low number of infected herds, the median epidemic duration was 20 days, though there was substantial variability ranging from 6 to 47 days. During this period, the number of clinical inspections reached 96 visits [1; 313] leading to a limited number of serological and virological investigations (4 [1; 36] and 1 [1; 11], respectively).
