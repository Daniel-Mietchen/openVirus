<p>The National Swine Identification Database (BDporc) has been registering all swine movements in France since 2010. Salines et al. (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) performed a social network analysis on movement data from 2012 to 2014 in which 10 types of production herds were identified. Data from year 2014, the latest full-year dataset at our disposal, were used to analyze the movement patterns between holding types. Two additional types of site were also considered: temporary stations (trade centers, TR) and slaughterhouses. A total of 21,446 sites were geographically located using the UTM-coordinate system so as to analyze swine movements based on distance. Four density zones were designed using Gaussian smoothing kernels, each containing 25% of the production sites. Movements were analyzed based on the “animal introduction model” (AIM) described by Salines et al. (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) to account for transmission through direct contact between animals from different production sites. Briefly, a one-mode directed network was built, wherein holdings were considered as nodes, and movements between two nodes were considered as links. All movements between two given holdings during the time period were aggregated into a single link. Links between holdings represented movements of animals being unloaded at farms. In-between movements forming a round were replaced by direct movements between holdings, i.e., intermediate transit movements of a truck through a farm without any animals being unloaded were excluded. In order to fulfill the model's input requirements, this network was further analyzed to characterize the connectivity and distance-related contact structure between the different types of production sites.
