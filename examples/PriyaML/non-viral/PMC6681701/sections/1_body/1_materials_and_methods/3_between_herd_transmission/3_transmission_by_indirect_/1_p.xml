<p>For medium- and low-risk contact, the number of outgoing animals is again evaluated using a Poisson distribution with respective frequencies of contact derived from the literature (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The force of infection exerted by an infected herd is proportional to the within-herd force of infection (Equation 1) with specific transmission rates (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The transmission probabilities also factor in the distance according to the same probability distribution as described by Halasa et al. (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
