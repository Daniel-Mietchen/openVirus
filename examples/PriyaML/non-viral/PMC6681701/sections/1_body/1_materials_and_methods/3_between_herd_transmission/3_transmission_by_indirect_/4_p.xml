<p>Different introduction scenarios were evaluated depending on the density zone and herd type of the initial case (nucleus/multiplier or randomly-selected herds). For each scenario in this study, 2,000 simulations were run to achieve convergence of the outputs with a stable mean behavior and variability. Equations and epidemiological parameters are detailed in the supplementary material of the original paper describing the modeling framework (
