<p>For each infected farm, the number of outgoing animals potentially entering into direct contact with other animals is first considered based on the actual frequency of movements derived from the movement database (BDPorc). For direct contact modeling, the number of animals involved in the movement is next evaluated depending on the herd size and type of production site. The destination herd is then randomly selected based on (i) the distance between the seeder and receiving herd, (ii) the type of production site, and (iii) the herd size, which has to be large enough to receive the incoming animals. Finally, the probability of transmission is evaluated based on both the prevalence of infectious individuals on the seeder farm and the size of the incoming batch.</p>
