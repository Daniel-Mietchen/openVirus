id="Abs1"><p id="Par1">While one of the biggest problems we are facing today is water scarcity, enormous quantities of water are still being used in irrigation. If contaminated, this water can act as an effective pathway for the spread of disease-causing agents, like viruses. Here, we present a novel, environmentally friendly method known as cold atmospheric plasma for inactivation of viruses in water used in closed irrigation systems. We measured the plasma-mediated viral RNA degradation as well as the plasma-induced loss of viral infectivity using potato virus Y as a model virus due to its confirmed water transmissibility and economic as well as biological importance. We showed that only 1&#x000a0;min of plasma treatment is sufficient for successful inactivation of viruses in water samples with either high or low organic background. The plasma-mediated inactivation was efficient even at markedly higher virus concentrations than those expected in irrigation waters. Obtained results point to reactive oxygen species as the main mode of viral inactivation. Our laboratory-scale experiments confirm for the first time that plasma has an excellent potential as the eukaryotic virus inactivation tool for water sources and could thus provide a cost-effective solution for irrigation mediated plant virus transmission. The outstanding inactivation efficiency demonstrated by plasma treatments in water samples offers further expansions of its application to other water sources such as reused wastewater or contaminated drinking waters, as well as other plant, animal, and human waterborne viruses, ultimately leading to the prevention of water scarcity and numerous human, animal, and plant infections worldwide.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s12560-019-09388-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cold atmospheric plasma</kwd><kwd>Potato virus Y</kwd><kwd>Virus inactivation</kwd><kwd>Water decontamination</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004329</institution-id><institution>Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P4 &#x02013; 0407</award-id><award-id>L4-9325</award-id><award-id>1000-18-0105</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The availability of clean water is in continued decline due to the increasing global population and food demand, along with higher standards of living and climate change (WWAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2018</xref>). Water scarcity has an important impact on the environment as it affects aquatic organisms, groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems as well as plants and humans (Pfister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>). Over the past 4&#x000a0;years, water scarcity has been regarded as one of the highest global risks, in terms of its potential impact on humanity (World Economic Forum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2017</xref>). Despite this, 70% of water use worldwide goes on account of irrigation (WWAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2018</xref>). This makes agriculture a major environmental burden in terms of water use (Ridoutt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>). To tackle this important global problem, closed irrigation systems that recycle water, such as hydroponic systems, are becoming more common. However, such systems can serve as a route for efficient and rapid transmission of pathogens in case of water source contamination. Plant pathogens can reduce seed germination, affect the yield and even destroy entire crops (Syed Ab Rahman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Water-transmissible viruses are especially problematic, as they are usually resistant to wastewater treatment processes (Carducci et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>) and common disinfection methods that have been developed to target mostly bacteria. Moreover, viruses can survive in water for long periods of time, can be infectious at low doses, and are the source of numerous human, animal and plant infections and epidemics (Mehle and Ravnikar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Shrestha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>). Potato virus Y (PVY) is a water-transmissible plant virus that can successfully spread through irrigation systems (Mehle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>). PVY is, economically and scientifically speaking, one of the 10 most important plant viruses worldwide (Scholthof et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>) and the most important potato viral pathogen which can cause up to 80% loss in crop production (Kogov&#x00161;ek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>). PVY isolates from the recombinant PVY<sup>NTN</sup> group are the most devastating and cause mosaic, chlorotic, and necrotic lesions on leaves as well as necrotic ringspots on tubers (Kogov&#x00161;ek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>). High losses in potato yield pose a big problem since potato is one of the most important crops in the world (FAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). In addition to potato, PVY can also infect other important crops, such as tobacco, tomato, and pepper (Scholthof et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Removal of viruses from irrigation systems is possible, but typically used methods can be expensive [membrane filtration, heating, ultraviolet (UV) light, ozonation], time consuming (slow filtration), require large infrastructure (slow filtration, heat), frequent maintenance (slow filtration, UV light, ozonation), produce undesirable side components (chlorination, ozonation), or need additional decontamination steps (some types of slow filtration, UV light) (Stewart-Wade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>). The greatest weakness of all chemical processes for water decontamination is the generation of toxic by-products as well as production, transport and handling of large amounts of dangerous decontaminants. The main limitation of physical methods is that they are effective only in water areas that are in the close proximity of the operating device (Kraft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>). Of all the disinfection methods, only thermal disinfection has been proven to be suitable for inactivation of plant viruses in hydroponic production systems (Bandte et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). Thus it is extremely important to develop and implement efficient and environmentally friendly approaches for water decontamination that do not require toxic chemicals and can be scaled up. One of the technologies that might fulfill these requirements is cold atmospheric plasma (CAP).</p><p id="Par5">Plasma is the fourth state of matter and it is generated by applying energy to a gas. It is a mixture of charged particles (i.e., ions, free electrons), reactive species, UV photons, and neutral particles (i.e., molecules, atoms in the excited or ground state). Due to some of these components, with the emphasis on the reactive chemical species, CAP has great antimicrobial potential (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>). The temperature of CAP at the point of application is usually&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, which makes it suitable for treating biological samples (Hoffmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). CAP devices for decontamination have been tested for various applications, such as in medicine and food processing, where they have been shown to be effective (Scholtz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). They have also been used for degradation of non-biological (Bansode et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>) and biological, mostly bacterial (Rashmei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>), contaminants in water. Although some studies of CAP&#x02013;virus interactions have already been performed (for review see Pradeep and Chulkyoon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>) only one brief study has examined the effects of CAP on a plant virus, tobacco mosaic virus (Hanbal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>), and only one study has described bacteriophage inactivation in water samples by CAP (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">The aim of the present study was to evaluate the applicability of CAP for inactivation of viruses in water from closed irrigation systems. We chose PVY<sup>NTN</sup> as the model virus because of its demonstrated water transmissibility and economic relevance. We showed that CAP can inactivate high concentrations of PVY<sup>NTN</sup> in nutrient solution after only 1&#x000a0;min of treatment and suggested that the inactivation is mainly mediated by the formation of reactive oxygen species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="Par7">For schematic representation of the experimental design, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the experimental design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12560_2019_9388_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Virus Source</title><p id="Par8">We used two sources of viruses in nutrient solution to create an approximation to water samples of different complexities that represent those used in closed irrigation systems. Plants infected with PVY<sup>NTN</sup> were homogenized and diluted in nutrient solution to provide the complex infected water samples (henceforth referred to as &#x02018;infected homogenate&#x02019;). The less complex infected water samples contained only purified PVY<sup>NTN</sup> (Online Resource 1a) diluted in nutrient solution. Ultracentrifugation-purified virus particles had lower concentration (henceforth referred to as &#x02018;low concentration pure virus&#x02019;) than chromatography-purified virus particles (henceforth referred to as &#x02018;high concentration pure virus&#x02019;). Untreated samples of infected homogenate and both types of pure virus were used as positive controls.</p><p id="Par9">Each infected homogenate was prepared by grinding 88&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;mg of the green parts (i.e., leaves and stems) of potato plants (<italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> cv. &#x02018;Pentland Squire&#x02019;) grown in vitro cultures and infected with PVY<sup>NTN</sup>. This was then mixed with 20&#x000a0;mL nutrient solution that consisted of tap water with added minerals (Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1994</xref>). We divided each of the infected homogenates into two samples of 10&#x000a0;mL: one that served as a positive control and was not treated further, and the other that was treated with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (control treatment, various concentrations) or CAP (various times).</p><p id="Par10">For isolation of the pure viruses, PVY<sup>NTN</sup>-infected tobacco and potato tissues from plants grown in the soil were prepared by grinding them in chilled (to 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) grinding buffer. PVY<sup>NTN</sup> was then purified using either a standard purification method that included saccharose and CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation (low concentration pure virus) or convective interaction media (CIM) monolithic chromatography (high concentration pure virus) (Rupar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>). We added the low concentration pure virus particles to 10&#x000a0;mL nutrient solution and then either left the sample untreated (positive controls) or treated it with simple magnetic stirring (control treatment), gas treatment (control treatment with the gas mixture used for CAP production, but in the absence of CAP), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (control treatment, various concentrations and times), or CAP (various times). The high concentration pure virus particles stayed untreated (positive control) or underwent CAP treatments (various times).</p><p id="Par11">The viral RNA for all of the virus preparations was quantified prior to their treatments using reverse-transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR). RT-ddPCR was performed with One-Step RT-ddPCR advanced kit for probes (Bio-Rad, USA) as described by Mehle et al.

RNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen, Germany) was used for RNA extractions from infected homogenates according to the manufacturer`s instructions, with minor modifications, namely, without using mercaptoethanol. RNA extractions from the pure virus were carried out with QIAmp Viral RNA minikit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, with minor modifications, namely, luciferase RNA (2&#x000a0;ng/sample) was added to the carrier RNA prior to extraction as an external control and the final elution step was performed with 45&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of RNAse-free water.

Besides examining applicability of CAP for virus inactivation in contaminated water samples, we also investigated the most probable mode of viral inactivation.</p><p id="Par21">Complete loss of virus infectivity (total inactivation) was achieved in 17 out of 18 CAP treatments (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Only one repeat of the infected homogenate treated by CAP for 5&#x000a0;min contained infective PVY<sup>NTN</sup>, which we detected in the upper non-inoculated leaves of the test plants. We detected PVY<sup>NTN</sup> in all of the plants inoculated with the positive control samples, while we have seen no PVY<sup>NTN</sup> infections for plants inoculated with the negative control (nutrient solution). Minimum time needed for inactivation of viruses in infected homogenate was 5&#x000a0;min, whereas only 1&#x000a0;min was needed for inactivation of pure virus both in high and low concentration. We speculated that difference in inactivation times originated from the amount of organic matter present in the infected homogenate, which can absorb the plasma irradiation and as such might &#x02018;protect&#x02019; viruses from it i.e., viruses might become less accessible to the irradiation. The most obvious proof that CAP interacts with plant organic matter was a discoloration of samples in the first few minutes of treatments (Online Resource 4). Additional cause for the difference could be varied initial amount of virus in the samples, which was determined using RT-ddPCR. Concentrations of PVY<sup>NTN</sup> in the infected homogenate ranged from 4.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> to 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> RNA copies/&#x000b5;L of sample,

id="Par22">Treated samples were tested for the presence of intact viral RNA by monitoring four targeted genes. We showed that the PVY<sup>NTN</sup> RNA was successfully degraded by the CAP treatments after 15&#x000a0;min for the infected homogenate, and after 5&#x000a0;min for low concentration pure virus (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). RNA was not degraded in any of the positive controls. Since RNA was not degraded in all of the experiments in which infectivity was abolished, it is likely that CAP also damages viral coat proteins, which destabilizes the virus particles. Indeed, coat protein damage alone might be enough to inactivate viruses. This is supported by the findings of different research groups which showed that coat protein damage after CAP treatment was a main mode of inactivation of different bacteriophages and mammalian viruses: bacteriophage lambda and MS2, human adenovirus and feline calicivirus (Aboubakr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>; Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>; Yasuda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>; Zimmermann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">To confirm that the viral inactivation was due to CAP treatment, we used control treatments that included H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, gas, or stirring. None of them had any effects on the PVY<sup>NTN</sup> RNA degradation, for either the infected homogenate or the pure virus (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Moreover, in the infectivity assays, across all of the control treatments, only the highest H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (25&#x000a0;mg/L) of the pure virus for 15&#x000a0;min effectively reduced the PVY<sup>NTN</sup> infectivity. However, the same treatment did not affect the PVY<sup>NTN</sup> infectivity in the infected homogenate (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This can be explained by either higher availability of the organic material (including viruses) in the infected homogenate with which the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can interact or by the presence of the plant enzymes in the infected homogenate that can degrade the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Z&#x000e1;mock&#x000fd; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>). The data for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a control treatment confirm its implication in plasma-mediated virus inactivation. However, the greater PVY<sup>NTN</sup> inactivation obtained with CAP, compared to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> alone, suggests that other plasma components are also involved in this CAP-mediated PVY<sup>NTN</sup> inactivation.</p><p id="Par24">We confirmed this with the OES measurements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) where we observed increased concentration of OH and O species that probably served as the precursors for production of different reactive oxygen species. Ar, O, and H atoms emission lines and OH emission system (A<sup>2</sup>&#x003a3;<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;X<sup>2</sup>&#x003a0;) were observed for all CAP treatments (Online Resource 5). The presence of OH emission system and Balmer H emission line in the OES spectra proves that water vapor is dissociated in the plasma. The intensities of spectral features did not change during the treatments, regardless of the sample type. A new spectral feature, N<sub>2</sub> emission bands, can be seen only in the OES spectrum of CAP in the air. These are present due to the diffusion of the ambient air into the plasma stream. The OH is also present in the free air CAP because of the humidity in the ambient air. However, the OH intensity is much smaller compared to the submerged CAP, thus indicating that the water from the samples is evaporated and dissociated in the plasma. We did not detect any response in the range between 200 and 300&#x000a0;nm, the wavelengths at which UV radiation damages nucleotides in different ways (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>). That is why we concluded that UV radiation could not have any impact on the virus inactivation. This leaves reactive oxygen species as the crucial CAP components of viral inactivation, an argument supported by various research groups (reviewed in Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">We have performed here a pioneering study using CAP treatment for eukaryotic virus inactivation in water samples. The use of CAP in our experiments effectively inactivated PVY<sup>NTN</sup> in water samples, both in combination with the high organic background from the plant debris (infected homogenate) and in the pure PVY<sup>NTN</sup> form. The inactivation was efficient even though the PVY<sup>NTN</sup> genome concentrations were significantly higher than those expected in irrigation waters (Mehle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>). These new findings confirm the potential that CAP treatments hold in the field of virus inactivation in irrigation water. They also lay the groundwork to further studies on other waterborne viruses of plant, animal and human origins, and on the opportunities for the scaling up of these CAP treatments. Plasma systems might also prove useful for decontamination of other water sources, such as wastewater, drinking water, and water for recreational use. Implementation of plasma systems in wastewater treatment plants would significantly reduce their running and maintenance costs, and the space required (Barillas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). That might prove to be an excellent alternative for many countries that reuse wastewater for irrigation without prior disinfection due to economic limitations and the scarcity of fresh water supplies (Moazeni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>). Implementation of plasma systems might thus have important positive effects on water quality and might provide solutions that are greatly needed today. To make this implementation as smooth as possible, additional studies are required to define the exact mechanism(s) of action and whether CAP treated water can have any effects on human, animal, and plant cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec9"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
