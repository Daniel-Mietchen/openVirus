<p id="Par5">Plasma is the fourth state of matter and it is generated by applying energy to a gas. It is a mixture of charged particles (i.e., ions, free electrons), reactive species, UV photons, and neutral particles (i.e., molecules, atoms in the excited or ground state). Due to some of these components, with the emphasis on the reactive chemical species, CAP has great antimicrobial potential (Guo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>). The temperature of CAP at the point of application is usually &lt; 40 °C, which makes it suitable for treating biological samples (Hoffmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). CAP devices for decontamination have been tested for various applications, such as in medicine and food processing, where they have been shown to be effective (Scholtz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). They have also been used for degradation of non-biological (Bansode et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>) and biological, mostly bacterial (Rashmei et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>), contaminants in water. Although some studies of CAP–virus interactions have already been performed (for review see Pradeep and Chulkyoon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>) only one brief study has examined the effects of CAP on a plant virus, tobacco mosaic virus (Hanbal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>), and only one study has described bacteriophage inactivation in water samples by CAP (Guo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>).
