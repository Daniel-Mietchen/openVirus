<p id="Par3">Water-transmissible viruses are especially problematic, as they are usually resistant to wastewater treatment processes (Carducci et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>) and common disinfection methods that have been developed to target mostly bacteria. Moreover, viruses can survive in water for long periods of time, can be infectious at low doses, and are the source of numerous human, animal and plant infections and epidemics (Mehle and Ravnikar 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Shrestha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>). Potato virus Y (PVY) is a water-transmissible plant virus that can successfully spread through irrigation systems (Mehle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>). PVY is, economically and scientifically speaking, one of the 10 most important plant viruses worldwide (Scholthof et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>) and the most important potato viral pathogen which can cause up to 80% loss in crop production (Kogovšek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>). PVY isolates from the recombinant PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> group are the most devastating and cause mosaic, chlorotic, and necrotic lesions on leaves as well as necrotic ringspots on tubers (Kogovšek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>). High losses in potato yield pose a big problem since potato is one of the most important crops in the world (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). In addition to potato, PVY can also infect other important crops, such as tobacco, tomato, and pepper (Scholthof et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>).
