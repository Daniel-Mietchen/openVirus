<p id="Par22">Treated samples were tested for the presence of intact viral RNA by monitoring four targeted genes. We showed that the PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> RNA was successfully degraded by the CAP treatments after 15 min for the infected homogenate, and after 5 min for low concentration pure virus (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). RNA was not degraded in any of the positive controls. Since RNA was not degraded in all of the experiments in which infectivity was abolished, it is likely that CAP also damages viral coat proteins, which destabilizes the virus particles. Indeed, coat protein damage alone might be enough to inactivate viruses. This is supported by the findings of different research groups which showed that coat protein damage after CAP treatment was a main mode of inactivation of different bacteriophages and mammalian viruses: bacteriophage lambda and MS2, human adenovirus and feline calicivirus (Aboubakr et al.
