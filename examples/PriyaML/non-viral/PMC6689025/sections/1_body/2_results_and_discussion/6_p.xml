<p id="Par25">We have performed here a pioneering study using CAP treatment for eukaryotic virus inactivation in water samples. The use of CAP in our experiments effectively inactivated PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> in water samples, both in combination with the high organic background from the plant debris (infected homogenate) and in the pure PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> form. The inactivation was efficient even though the PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> genome concentrations were significantly higher than those expected in irrigation waters (Mehle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>). These new findings confirm the potential that CAP treatments hold in the field of virus inactivation in irrigation water. They also lay the groundwork to further studies on other waterborne viruses of plant, animal and human origins, and on the opportunities for the scaling up of these CAP treatments. Plasma systems might also prove useful for decontamination of other water sources, such as wastewater, drinking water, and water for recreational use. Implementation of plasma systems in wastewater treatment plants would significantly reduce their running and maintenance costs, and the space required (Barillas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). That might prove to be an excellent alternative for many countries that reuse wastewater for irrigation without prior disinfection due to economic limitations and the scarcity of fresh water supplies (Moazeni et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>). Implementation of plasma systems might thus have important positive effects on water quality and might provide solutions that are greatly needed today. To make this implementation as smooth as possible, additional studies are required to define the exact mechanism(s) of action and whether CAP treated water can have any effects on human, animal, and plant cells.
