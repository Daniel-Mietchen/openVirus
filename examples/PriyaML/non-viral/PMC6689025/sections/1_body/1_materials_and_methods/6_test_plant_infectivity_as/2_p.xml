<p id="Par19">We regularly inspected test plants for development of symptoms of PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> infection (Online Resource 1c), and confirmed viral infectivity and systemic spreading using reverse-transcription real-time (quantitative) PCR (RT-qPCR). We sampled two developed non-inoculated upper leaves 14 ± 1 days and 32 ± 1 days post-inoculation, and pooled together all of the plant material from the plants inoculated with the same sample. We then extracted the RNA with RNeasy plant minikit according to the manufacturer`s instructions, with minor modifications i.e., without using mercaptoethanol and the final RNA elution was carried out with 150 µL of RNAse-free water. After that we performed RT-qPCR using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-qPCR mix (Ambion, USA), as described by Mehle et al. (
