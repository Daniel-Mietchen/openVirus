<p id="Par17">After the extractions RNA was amplified for the following four PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> genes using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): P1 and P3 (which code for proteins involved in virus replication), NIa (which codes for a serine-like cysteine protease), and CP (which codes for the coat protein) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Online Resource 1b). This selection of the viral genes enabled us to cover different parts of the viral genome. RT-PCR was prepared using One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), protocol without Q-solution, according to the manufacturer`s instructions, with minor modifications, namely, smaller volume reactions were prepared and 5 µL of template RNA was used. The cycling conditions were 30 min at 50 °C, 15 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 52 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, 7 min at 72 °C, and an infinite hold at 4 °C. Sterile water was used as a non-template control of RT-PCR reactions to monitor possible contaminations of the PCR reagents. We detected the amplified PCR products using agarose gel electrophoresis and considered RNA as degraded, if at least one of the four targeted genes was not amplified.
