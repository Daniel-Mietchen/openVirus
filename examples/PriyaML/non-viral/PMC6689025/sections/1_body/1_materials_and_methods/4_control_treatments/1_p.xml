<p id="Par15">We used a series of control treatments to confirm that any effect on the PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> arose from the CAP treatments. The first two control treatments consisted of either stirring of the low concentration pure virus on the magnetic stirrer for 1 min or treating it for 1 min with the gas mixture used for CAP production, but in the absence of CAP. The next stage control treatment included the addition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to the samples. We applied H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> at final concentrations of 12.5 mg/L and 25 mg/L for 15 min with constant stirring for the infected homogenates. For the low concentration pure viruses, we applied H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> at final concentrations of 0.5 mg/L and 1 mg/L for 1 min and 25 mg/L for 15 min with constant stirring. Used H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations reflected those found to be present after various CAP treatments (see Online Resources 2 and 3).
