<p id="Par9">Each infected homogenate was prepared by grinding 88 ± 3 mg of the green parts (i.e., leaves and stems) of potato plants (
 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> cv. ‘Pentland Squire’) grown in vitro cultures and infected with PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup>. This was then mixed with 20 mL nutrient solution that consisted of tap water with added minerals (Johnson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1994</xref>). We divided each of the infected homogenates into two samples of 10 mL: one that served as a positive control and was not treated further, and the other that was treated with hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) (control treatment, various concentrations) or CAP (various times).
