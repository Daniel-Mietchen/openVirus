<p id="Par8">We used two sources of viruses in nutrient solution to create an approximation to water samples of different complexities that represent those used in closed irrigation systems. Plants infected with PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> were homogenized and diluted in nutrient solution to provide the complex infected water samples (henceforth referred to as ‘infected homogenate’). The less complex infected water samples contained only purified PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> (Online Resource 1a) diluted in nutrient solution. Ultracentrifugation-purified virus particles had lower concentration (henceforth referred to as ‘low concentration pure virus’) than chromatography-purified virus particles (henceforth referred to as ‘high concentration pure virus’). Untreated samples of infected homogenate and both types of pure virus were used as positive controls.
