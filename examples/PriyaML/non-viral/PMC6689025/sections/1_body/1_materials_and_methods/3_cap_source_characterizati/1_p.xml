<p id="Par12">We used a CAP system in the single electrode configuration to investigate the inactivation of PVY
 <sup>NTN</sup> in the infected samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). CAP was created using a mixture of argon (~ 99%) and oxygen (~ 1%), with a constant flow rate of 1 ± 0.2 L/min. The plasma or only the gas mixture was introduced into the infected samples using a perforated quartz glass tube. A copper electrode was inserted in the tube and connected to a low-frequency generator (31 kHz) that operated at a peak-to-peak voltage of 6 kV, with total average output power of ~ 3 W.
