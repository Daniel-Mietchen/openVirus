<p id="Par14">Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was used to observe the light emitted by the plasma during the treatments. An Avantes AvaSpec-3648 optical spectrometer with a resolution of 0.5 nm from 200 to 1100 nm was used. The integration time was set to 1 s. We measured spectra during CAP treatments of various samples: nutrient solution, low concentration pure virus, and infected homogenate. Additionally, as a control, the OES spectrum of CAP treatment without sample (CAP in the air) was recorded (Fig.
