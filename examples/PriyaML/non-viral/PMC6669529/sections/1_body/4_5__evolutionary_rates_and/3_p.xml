<p>CDV evolutionary rates (substitution rates per site per year [subs/site/yr]) for the 
 <italic>H</italic> gene were estimated in 4.8E-4 subs/site/yr, with 95% HPD and a range of 3.9 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 5.9 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> subs/site/yr, representing a high evolutionary capacity [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Other substitution rates have been reported, including 11.65 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> and 7.41 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> subs/site/yr [

 <xref rid="B139-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. This shows that substitution rates of CDV are slightly higher compared to other morbilliviruses such as MeV (6.5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> subs/site/yr) [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The high genetic variability of CDV may have facilitated the inter-species jump, and its adaptation and specialization to other hosts [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. It is important to remember that tMRCA studies for CDV and for other viruses are based on available sequences in the Genbank, generating a bias that must be taken into account in the analysis of the results, since it can not necessarily coincide with the historical records present in the literature as has been recently discussed by others [
