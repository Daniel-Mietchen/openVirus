<p>The report of an outbreak in giant panda (
 <italic>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</italic>) suggests that subclinical disease is also possible in this species, as during the outbreak one individual did not show clinical signs despite the detection of CDV genome from blood and nasal swabs samples. This animal had been previously vaccinated suggesting that the protective immune responses elicited by vaccination against CDV were not sufficient to prevent CDV infection acquired naturally, but may have attenuated disease, as this was the only individual that survived the outbreak [

 <italic>Procyon lotor</italic>) and gray foxes (
 <italic>Urocyon cinereoargenteus</italic>) a high percentage of asymptomatic individuals were positive for CDV (55%) [
