<p>For the case of CDV, the large domestic dog world population could represent such a favorable, homogeneous environment that permitted the optimization of CDV fitness in this particular host. Accordingly, fitness assays showed that the CDV-H protein from domestic dog had a higher performance in cell lines expressing domestic dog than non-canid (African lion and domestic cat) SLAM, as expected in antagonistic pleiotropy. On the other hand, non-canid CDV-H proteins performed equally well regardless of which host SLAM (canid or non-canid) was expressed, but the overall performance was lower than that of domestic dog CDV-H protein in cells expressing domestic dog SLAM. Moreover, the substitution of site 549 from a canid to non-canid residue in the domestic dog CDV-H protein showed a reduction in fitness in domestic dog cells [
