<p>Due to the lack of knowledge about the ecoepidemiology of the virus in wild-life ecosystems, it is necessary to look for virus reservoirs, defined as one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which the CDV can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the defined target population. Populations in a reservoir may be the same or a different species as the target population [
