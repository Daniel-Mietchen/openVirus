<p>The nectin-4 receptor is involved in cell-to-cell propagation of CDV and MeV, and also in cell-cell fusion (syncytia formation) [

 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Four binding sites on the nectin-4 receptor have been identified (F132, P133, A134, and G135) for the optimal binding to CDV H both in dogs and humans [

 <xref rid="B108-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], however it has been found that in domestic dogs nectin-4 is also found in neurons, ependymal cells, epithelia of choroid plexus, meningeal cells, granular cells, and Purkinjeâ€™s cells, which could indicate its partial involvement in the neurovirulence of CDV observed in dogs [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Besides the presence of nectin-4 in the white matter or astrocyte cultures of dogs has not been confirmed, suggesting the existence of a third cellular receptor [
