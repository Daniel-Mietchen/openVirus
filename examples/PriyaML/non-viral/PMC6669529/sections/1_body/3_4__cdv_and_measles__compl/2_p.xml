<p>Previous studies have shown that morbilliviruses including CDV, phocine distemper, rinderpest and peste des petits ruminants virus circulate in nature [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] by using two primary receptors: SLAM, expressed in cells of the innate immune response, and in activated T and B cells [
