<p>Recent analyses of the CDV strain responsible for the outbreak in lions of Serengeti National Park in the 1990s demonstrated that all the species affected (including dogs and wild canids) presented the 530D substitution [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], agreeing with Liao et al. [
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-11-00582" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>] who reported the 530 site is not directly related to host adaptation because it is conserved in different species. In addition, although an association has not been statistically established, it has been shown that dogs have a greater tendency to present 549Y, while substitution 549H occurs most commonly in wildlife, which shows a possible association between this substitution and the affected species [
