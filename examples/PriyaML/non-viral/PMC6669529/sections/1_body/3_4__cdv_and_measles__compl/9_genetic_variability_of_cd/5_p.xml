<p>Domestic dogs have eight possible substitutions at position 530 (G/D/N/E/R/S/A/K) and two substitutions at 549 (H/Y) present in at least ten lineages; in non-canid wild animals there are seven substitutions at position 530 (G/D/N/E/R/C/V) and two substitutions at position 549 (H/Y) present in seven lineages. On the other hand, wild canids have three substitutions at position 530 (G/N/R) and two substitutions at position 549 (H/Y) that are present in five lineages. (
