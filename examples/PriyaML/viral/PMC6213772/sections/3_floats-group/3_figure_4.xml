  <p>Generation of LAIV: (
   <bold>A</bold>) Isolation of the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 LAIV MDV: A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 wild-type (WT) was serially passage 100 times (P1 to P100) in chicken kidney tissue culture (CKTC) cells under gradually reduced temperatures (36 째C to 24 째C). The obtained A/Ann Arbor/6/60 LAIV contained several mutations and the ones responsible for the att, ca, and ts has been mapped to a single residue in PB2 (N265S), three residues in PB1 (K391E, E581G, and A661T) and a single residue (D34G) in NP (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 LAIV is used as master donor virus (MDV) to produce the seasonal LAIV. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Generation of the A/Leningrad/134/17/57 H2N2 LAIV MDV: A/Leningrad/134/17/57 H2N2 WT was serially passage 20 times (P1 to P20) in embryonated chicken eggs at optimal temperature of 32 째C. Then, the A/Leningrad/134/17/57 H2N2 LAIV MDV was obtained after 17 additional passages at 25 째C. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Schematic representation to produce the seasonal LAIV: The traditional method for generating reassortant virus is based on the co-infection with two influenza viruses in eggs. Both the WHO candidate IAV (left) and the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 LAIV MDV (right) are inoculated in eggs followed by the selection of appropriate seed viruses by amplification in the presence of antibodies against the HA and NA of A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2. The resulting virus containing the HA (red) and NA (blue) segments from the WHO-recommended IAV strain and the six inteRNAl vRNAs of the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 LAIV is amplified and used for vaccine production and used as a seasonal LAIV.
