<p>The PB2 N265S amino acid substitution in the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 appears to be part of electrostatic interactions between two PB2 domains, which might explain the ts phenotype associate to this change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f005">Figure 5</xref>). However, many details regarding the location and potential functions of amino acids involved in ts, ca, and att phenotypes remain elusive because the lack of high-resolution structures depicting the interactions between the polymerase subunits or their interaction with the viral NP. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude the role of these amino acid substitutions. Moreover, it is possible that the mutations in the viral polymerase complex or NP responsible for the ts, ca, and att phenotype of the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 affect known or unknown interactions with other viral and/or host cellular proteins.
