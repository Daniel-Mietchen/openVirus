<p>By using the recent resolved crystal structure of the bat IAV polymerase (PDB ID 4WSB) or A/WSN/33 H1N1 (WSN) NP (PDB ID 3RO5), the location of the identified amino acid variations in the revertant or original ts viruses can be analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In PB1, the original ts, ca, and att amino acid change A661T localize in a region where PB1 and PB2 interact and in the PB1:RNA interface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, the amino acid substitutions K391E and E51K in the PB1 from the original MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 or the revertant viruses, respectively, are far apart in the linear sequence, although they appear to be proximal in the protein structure (

 <xref rid="B156-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Moreover, there is a basic (K) to acidic (E) change in the original MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 PB1 at position 391 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f005">Figure 5</xref>), while the described revertant has an acidic (E) to basic (K) change in the same structural region at position 51, suggesting that this region may be involved in interactions with other viral and/or host cellular proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f005">Figure 5</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B156-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Interestingly, with the exception of NP I186, the amino acid changes in the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 revertants were mapped on the surfaces of the PB1 (K51 and V171), PA subunits (K350), and NP (Y125) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f005">Figure 5</xref>). PB1 V171 is located in the interface between PB1 and PA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00560-f005">Figure 5</xref>), and this position could be involved in intermolecular PB1-PA interactions. In fact, the amino acid substitution N350K identified in the PA polymerase subunit of the revertant MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 virus could also be involved in this interaction with the PB1 subunit (
