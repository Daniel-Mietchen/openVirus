<p>There are two major evolutionary mechanisms responsible for seasonal and pandemic influenza. First, antigenic drift, a characteristic shared with other RNA viruses, involves the introduction of mutations in the viral genome, leading to the selection of viral mutants with resistance against current antivirals and/or neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) [

Second, the segmented nature of IAV genome allow the exchange of viral segments between different viral strains co-infecting the same cell (antigenic shift). This reassortment event can lead to a new pandemic virus when a new virus is introduced in the human population. Given the ability of IAV to modify their genome and their rapid transmission, seasonal influenza vaccines need to be reformulated annually to ensure that the two viral glycoproteins (HA and NA) in the vaccine match circulating seasonal viruses. Therefore, even though vaccination is the best intervention option to protect against seasonal IAV infections, the efficiency of current vaccination approaches has been shown to be suboptimal for Influenza And new prophylactic approaches to protect against this important human virus are highly desirable [
