<p>Independent of type, seasonal influenza vaccines typically contain antigens from the two IAV subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and one IBV subtype (Victoria- and/or Yamagata-like lineages) currently circulating in humans [

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Worryingly, over the past decade, seasonal influenza vaccines have shown a low protection efficacy rate [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In order to improve the effectiveness of current seasonal influenza vaccines, a quadrivalent influenza vaccine formulation, including both IBV lineage components (Victoria- and Yamagata-like lineages) was approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its use during the 2012 season [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], leading the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to make the recommendation that the quadrivalent LAIV should not be used during 2016–17 or 2017–18 in the US [

The variability in influenza vaccine efficiency is leading to an increasing concern on how to combat influenza virus infection and protect population from seasonal infections. Consequently, new approaches are necessary to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza virus infections, as are studies aimed to better understand the biology and virulence factors of this significant human respiratory pathogen. Moreover, new approaches to attenuate the virus are urgently needed to overcome the limitations associated with the current LAIV.
