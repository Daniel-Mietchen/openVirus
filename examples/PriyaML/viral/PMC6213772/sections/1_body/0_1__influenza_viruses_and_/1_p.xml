<p>Influenza viruses are enveloped viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family and are the causative agents of influenza. There are four recognized influenza types denoted as A, B, C, and the recently discovered D [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Influenza A viruses (IAV) are able to infect a wide range of avian and mammalian species, including humans, and mostly exist in the wild aquatic fowl reservoir [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. IAV have been associated with pandemics in humans, mainly because their ability to infect different hosts, reassort their genome, and freely replicate in the absence of pre-existing immunity in humans. In contrast, influenza B viruses (IBV) are mainly restricted and adapted to humans, although sporadic infections of seals have been documented [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Because of their restriction to infect humans, IBV have not been responsible, to date, for human pandemics. Influenza C viruses (ICV) normally cause a mild respiratory illness in humans and are not thought to cause epidemics or pandemics [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The newly identified influenza D viruses (IDV) primarily affect cattle and pigs and, to date, are not known to infect or cause illness in humans [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. IAV and IBV infections represent a serious public health problem that cause contagious respiratory disease and substantial morbidity and mortality in humans, resulting in a considerable economic burden worldwide [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Public health concerns posed by IAV and IBV in humans are further aggravated by their ability to efficiently transmit and the limited antiviral therapeutic options for the treatment of viral infections.
