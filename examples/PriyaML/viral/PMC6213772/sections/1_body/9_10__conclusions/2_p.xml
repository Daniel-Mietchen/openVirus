<p>The recently published high-resolution structures of the IAV polymerase complex and the new advances in the study of the mechanism of vRNA synthesis have expanded our current knowledge of this threatening human respiratory pathogen, providing researchers the opportunity to analyze the mechanism of virulence, transmission, and/or host adaptation. In addition, understanding the mechanism(s) of regulation of the viral polymerase complex could assist in the rational design of safer and more immunogenic and protective LAIV. In this review, we have discussed the use of ts, ca, and att mutations in IAV for the generation of LAIV. This approach could provide a deliberate method of viral attenuation, which could be applicable for the treatment of either seasonal and/or pandemic IAV infections, or viral strains infecting other host species. Furthermore, combination of polymerase thermosensitivity with other approaches can assure a higher attenuated profile for the development of safer LAIV as well as advance in the generation of universal IAV vaccines [

Universal vaccines candidates are required to induce cross-protective broadly neutralizing immunity, stimulating both humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. Moreover, universal vaccines should avoid the necessity of annual re-vaccination [

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Finally, insights into the molecular mechanisms of viral replication and transcription could provide important information for the rational structure-based design of ts, ca, and att LAIV as well as the identification of novel antivirals for the prevention and treatment, respectively, of IAV infections.
