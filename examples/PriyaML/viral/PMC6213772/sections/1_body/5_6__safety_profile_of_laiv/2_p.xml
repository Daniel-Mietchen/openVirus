<p>Tsfasman et al. studied a revertant virus for the MDV Len/47, which was generated after 18 passages at elevated temperatures (up to 40 °C) in embryonated chicken eggs [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. During this adaptation, the virus lost the ts and ca phenotype, since the virus was able to grow with high titers at 40 °C, and also the ability to replicate efficiently at lower temperatures (26 °C). Most importantly, the revertant virus replicated at similar levels than the WT A/Leningrad/134/57 H2N2 virus in mouse lungs. Sequencing of the revertant virus discovered 29 nucleotide changes, 15 of them resulting in amino acid substitutions in PB2 (L478V), PB1 (T156I, N265K, K358E, D521A, and Q686E), PA (D327E, Q452H, and V463A), NP (D101N and A180G), M1 (F144L and S231D), and NS1 (P23A and P164L) (
