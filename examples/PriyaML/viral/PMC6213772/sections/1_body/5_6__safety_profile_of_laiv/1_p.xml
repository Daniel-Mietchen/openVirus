<p>There are multiple scientific and clinical evidences demonstrating the safety profile of the licensed seasonal human US LAIV (FluMist). However, recently Zhou et al. carried out an interesting study to evaluate the ability of the attenuated US LAIV to revert the ts and att phenotype in vitro [
 <xref rid="B156-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Intriguingly, authors have reported that the original attenuated MDV might revert to a virulent virus after 20 passages (P1-P20) in vitro at gradually elevated temperatures from 30 °C to 39 °C. Moreover, they were able to identify seven amino acid substitutions responsible for the reverting phenotype (

 <xref rid="B156-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Authors found that only five amino acid changes: PB1 (E51K and I171V; found in P10 and P15, respectively), PA (N350K; found in P5), and NP (N125Y and/or V186I; found at P5 and P20, respectively) were enough to revert the ts phenotype of the US MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2. Importantly, in vivo, the revertant virus was pathogenic in mice as compared to the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2. Interestingly, the amino acid changes responsible for the reversion phenotype were not mapped in positions previously defined to be responsible of the ts, ca, and att phenotype of the MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 (
