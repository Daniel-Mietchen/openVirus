<p>Currently, vaccination represent the best prophylactic measure to protect against viral infections. Multiple strategies and technology approaches have been developed for the generation of vaccines with safety profiles and immunogenic and protective characteristics. Several viral LAV are associated with a ts phenotype [

 <xref rid="B117-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] and they have been outstandingly successful in controlling infections by multiple viruses [

 <xref rid="B119-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>,
 <xref rid="B120-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. It is likely that ts mutations attenuate viruses by diminishing viral replication or pathogenesis at a specific body temperature, while maintaining the immunogenicity of a wild-type (WT) virus. Therefore, the use of ts attenuated viruses are considered as effective LAV and one of the best prophylactic measure to prevent disease caused by viral infections, including influenza. Moreover, in the case of influenza, LAIV administration mimics the route of a natural infection inducing mucosal immunity, which is important to inhibit viral infectivity in the host upper respiratory track at the initial steps of viral infection [

 <xref rid="B38-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Here, we will review well-known ts mutations in the viral polymerase of IAV, and further discuss the potential use of the resolved crystal structure of the IAV polymerase complex for the rational design of novel LAIV candidates to protect against IAV infections.
