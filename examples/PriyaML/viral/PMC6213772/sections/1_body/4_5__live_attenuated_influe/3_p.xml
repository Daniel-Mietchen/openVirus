<p>The mutations responsible for the ts, ca, and att phenotype of IAV MDV A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 used in the US have been mapped in three viral segments: the viral polymerase subunits PB1 (K391E, D581G, and A661T) and PB2 (N265S) (

A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (Len/17) H2N2 MDV was obtained after 20 sequential passages at 32 °C and 17 additional passages at 25 °C of A/Leningrad/134/57 H2N2 WT in chicken embryonated eggs. A/Leningrad/134/47/57 (Len/47) H2N2 MDV was obtained similarly to Len/17 but after 47 sequential additional passages in chicken embryonated eggs at 25 °C. [

Although the genetic changes responsible for the further ts, ca phenotype of Len/47 have not been well characterized, the virus contains three additional amino acid substitutions in the PB1 (M317I), PB2 (S490R), and NP (L341I), as compare with Len/17 (
