<p>The human LAIV used in the US was generated by the adaptation of an IAV (A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2) to growth at suboptimal decreasing temperatures (36–25 °C) during multiple passages in primary chicken kidney tissue culture (CKTC) cells (

 <xref rid="B124-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. During this ts adaptation process, A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 gained multiple mutations in the viral genome, which are responsible of the ts and cold-adapted (ca) phenotype that allow the virus to grow efficiently at low (25 °C) temperatures. However, viral replication is restricted at higher temperatures, which are found in the human lower respiratory tract or during febrile process (&gt;35 °C), resulting in an attenuated (att) phenotype [

 <xref rid="B124-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. This allows the host to mount an effective immune response to the infection in the upper airway and nasal cavity, without risking pathogenesis from a lower airway infection, which is the site of the most significant sequelae of influenza infection [
