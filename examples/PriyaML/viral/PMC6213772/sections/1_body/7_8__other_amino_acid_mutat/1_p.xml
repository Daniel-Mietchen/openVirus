<p>In addition to the mutations located in the viral segments of the current licensed human LAIV, genetic studies from multiple researchers using different IAV strains have identified other amino acid changes in the viral polymerase complex (PB2, PB1, and PA) and NP that are related with a ts and att phenotype [

 <xref rid="B161-viruses-10-00560" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. The analysis of all these amino acid substitutions is out of the scope of this review, and this section is limited to provide some examples with relevance for vaccine design and/or development. However, it is important emphasize that high resolution influenza polymerase structure will have significant implications to understand the mechanisms involved in ts and att phenotypes.
