<p>It has been demonstrated in mice that immunization with a formalin-inactivated EV-A71 vaccine can elicit high titers of EV-A71 virus-specific neutralizing antibodies, conferring protection against an EV-A71 lethal challenge

  <sup>53</sup>
 </xref> . After successful preclinical experiments, phase I and phase II clinical trials were performed to determine the efficacy of inactivated EV-A71 candidate vaccines. Immunization with inactivated EV-A71 vaccine elicited high titers of neutralizing antibody and induced specific T-cell reactions in the study population, with no significant inflammatory reaction reported

  <sup>54</sup>
 </xref> . In addition, another study indicated that inactivated EV-A71 vaccine candidates can elicit cross-neutralizing antibody responses against EV-A71 subgenogroups B1, B4, B5 and C4A

 </xref> . Due to their stability, the research and development of inactivated EV-A71 vaccines has progressed more rapidly compared to other types of vaccines. In recent years, at least five inactivated EV-A71 vaccine candidates have been developed and advanced to clinical trials. All EV-A71 vaccines developed in China are inactivated whole-virus alum-adjuvant vaccines
 <sup>1.</sup> All of them use the C4 subgenogroup virus as the vaccine strain

 </xref> . Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of EV-A71 vaccines have been completed

  <sup>56</sup>
 </xref> . More than 30,000 infants and children have been involved in Phase III clinical trials of inactivated EV-A71 C4 vaccines in China

  <sup>56</sup>
 </xref> . These studies have shown that the EV-A71 vaccines can prevent more than 90% of EV-A71-associated HFMD or herpangina and 80% of other EV-A71-associated disease symptoms. It has been reported that the seroconversion rate is 100% after two vaccinations, and all C4-based vaccines prevented EV-A71-associated hospitalizations. Furthermore, preexisting antibodies due to undetected subclinical infections in young children did not interfere with vaccine efficacy against different EV-A71 genogroups
