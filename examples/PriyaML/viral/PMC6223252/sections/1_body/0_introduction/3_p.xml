<p>Although the EV-A71 virus has been isolated in many countries, epidemics of EV-A71 infection are predominantly found in the Asia-Pacific region

In this review, we present and discuss the molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of EV-A71 infections, as well the prospects for the development of an EV-A71 vaccine.
