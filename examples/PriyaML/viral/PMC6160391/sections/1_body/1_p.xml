<p id="Par2">Innate immune system is an important barrier of defending against influenza virus infection. According to the traditional paradigm, after IAV gets across the mucus that covers the respiratory epithelium, it first invades and infects respiratory epithelial cells, from where it spreads to other non-immune and immune cells (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells). In these cells, the virus can be sensed by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), triggering the production of type I interferons (IFNs) which induce the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that block viral replication and further virus spread. Simultaneously, activation of PRRs also leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1Î², IL-18, TNF, etc.) and chemokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines induce topical and systemic inflammation, cause fever and anorexia, and direct the adaptive immune response against the virus. Chemokines, on the other hand, recruit innate immune cells (neutrophils, monocytes, and NK cells) which engulf and inactivate the virus, kill virally infected cells, and guide subsequent innate and adaptive immune responses that mediate ultimate viral clearance (Iwasaki and Pillai,
