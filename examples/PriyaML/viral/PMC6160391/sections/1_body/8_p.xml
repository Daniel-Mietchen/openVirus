<p id="Par9">Interferons (IFNs) are classified into three categories (type I IFNs, type II IFNs, and type III IFNs). All IFNs signal through JAK/STAT pathway which leads to transcription of ISGs, but their production cells and receptor specificity are different (Chow and Gale, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>). Type I IFNs include IFN-α, β, ε, κ, and ω. They can be produced by almost all cell types and their receptor is the widely-expressed heterodimer composed of IFNR1 and IFNR2. Type II IFN is INF-γ, which is produced by immune cells and forms dimmer to act on the receptor complex consisting of two IFNR1 and two IFNR2. Type III IFNs include IFN-λ1 (IL-29), IFN-λ2 (IL-28A), IFN-λ3 (IL-28B), and IFN-λ4. Their receptor is the heterodimeric complex composed of IFN-λR1 and IL-10Rβ. IL-10Rβ is broadly distributed, but the expression of IFN-λR1 is mainly restricted to epithelial cells (Broggi et al.,
