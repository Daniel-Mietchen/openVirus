<p id="Par3">However, effective protection from influenza virusÂ infection is provided by finely tuned antiviral immunity, while excessive innate immunity causes detrimental inflammation. Infection with influenza viruses is usually self-limited, though the severe cases, especially caused by highly virulent strains (e.g., the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, H5N1 and H7N9) are characterized by severe pulmonary disease and lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Bauer et al.,

Influenza-induced ARDS, which involves the damage to the epithelial-endothelial barrier of the pulmonary alveolus, flute leakage to the alveolar lumen, and respiratory insufficiency, is associated not only with direct viral damage to epithelial-endothelial barrier, but also with inflammation mediated by components of the innate immune response. The cytokines produced in influenza virus infected epithelial and endothelial cells, and cytokines and reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils and macrophages recruited to pulmonary alveolus all contribute to damage to the epithelial-endothelial barrier (Short et al.,
