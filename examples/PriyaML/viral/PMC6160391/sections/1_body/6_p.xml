<p id="Par7">To verify this, we performed a qPCR analysis to determine the expression level of IFNs genes, as well as three important antiviral ISGs: Mx1, ISG20 and IFITM1 at 4, 8, and 12 h post infection. Consistent with the RNA-seq data analysis, IFN-λ expression was significantly increased at all the time points. The Mx1, ISG20 and IFITM1 also displayed markedly altered mRNA levels during IBV infection. In contrast, the expression of IFN-α was not altered at all points (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Since the function of both IFN-λ and IFN-α is induction of ISG expression 
 <italic>via</italic> the same intracellular signaling pathways, we speculate that it is IFN-λ rather than IFN-α that dominates the production of ISGs in IBV-infected A549 cells. Indeed, the IBV NP protein levels were obviously decreased in IFN-λ stimulated A549 cells, indicating the potent antiviral activity during IBV replication in A549 cell (Fig.
