<p id="Par8">Based on the above results and KEGG pathways assay, we built the intracellular signaling pathway related to IBV infection in A549 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). IBV infection begins with viral HA binding to α-2,3 or α-2,6 sialic acid on the host cell surface. After binding to the receptor, the virus enters the endosome, where the acidic environment triggers virus-host cell membrane fusion, after which the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the virus-derived RNA is recognized by multiple canonical pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs, RIG-I, and MD5), the Toll-like receptors (TLRs, TLR-3, and 7), the NOD-like receptors (NLR and NOD1/2), and the PKR, and activates their respective signaling pathways. Activation of these pathways leads to the expression of IFN-λs, which then interact with their receptor, the heterogeneous dimer IFNLR1/IL-10R, and activate the expression of ISGs through the JAK/STAT pathway.
