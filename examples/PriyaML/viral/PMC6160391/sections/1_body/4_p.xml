<p id="Par5">Most current knowledge about innate immunity in influenza virus infection has come from IAV. Although IBV contributes a significant part to the burden arising from the worldwide epidemics of seasonal influenza, much less attention has been paid to IBV than IAV because IBV does not have a potential to cause a pandemic (Chai et al.,
