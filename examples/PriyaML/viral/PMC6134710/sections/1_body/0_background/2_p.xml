 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Dengue and chikungunya are serious public health issues in tropical regions, and each virus family has different serotypes, lineages and genotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Dengue is caused by four genetically distinct DENV serotypes (1, 2, 3 and 4) and generally lead to a self-limited febrile illness characterised by a headache, fever and rash. CHIKV causes an acute febrile illness characterised by severe arthralgia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that CHIKV lineages can be classified into three distinct genotypes: Asian, West African and Eastern/Central/Southern African (ECSA). Both DENV and CHIKV infections have a large proportion of asymptomatic cases contributing actively to virus dissemination and transmission [
