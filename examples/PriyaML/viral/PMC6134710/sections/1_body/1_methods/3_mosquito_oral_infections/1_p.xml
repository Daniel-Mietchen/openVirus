<p id="Par19">Four batches of 60 one-week-old female adults were fed on an infectious blood-meal that consisted of 1400 μl of washed rabbit erythrocytes, 700 μl of viral suspension, supplemented with 5 mM adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a phagostimulant. Two feeders were prepared per virus, and a feeder was available to two batches of mosquito (successively) for 20 min. The viral titre of the infectious blood-meal was determined at 2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> focus-forming units (ffu)/ml for DENV-2 and 2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> ffu/ml for CHIKV. After exposure, fully engorged females were transferred to cardboard containers and maintained with 10% sucrose at 28 ± 1 °C and 80% relative humidity.
