<p id="Par22">The susceptibility of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Madeira Island for CHIKV was studied using a viral strain belonging to Asian lineage, as the current circulating lineage in the Americas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our results showed that local 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> can transmit CHIKV very efficiently: Funchal and Paúl do Mar populations were both highly susceptible to CHIKV infection, with similar infection rates [Chi-square test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05; 3 dpi (

 <italic>χ</italic>
