<p id="Par25">The potential of DENV-2 transmission by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Madeira was measured by infecting mosquitoes with a DENV-2 strain from Bangkok. IR, DR and TR were assessed at 7 and 14 dpi (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Our study indicated a different pattern of susceptibility to dengue infection compared to chikungunya infection. While both populations presented similar IR [Chi-square test 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05; 7 dpi (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 2.05, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.15); 14 dpi (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 3.13, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.08)], the Funchal population ensured a better dissemination of DENV-2 than Paúl do Mar at 7 dpi [Chi-square test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; 7 dpi (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 4.27, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.04)] Virus titer in heads was slightly higher at 14 dpi for the Funchal strain (Mann-Whitney test: 
 <italic>Z</italic> = 2.11, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). The maximum number of DENV-2 particles in mosquito heads was detected at 14 dpi for both populations: 4.51 ± 0.63 log
 <sub>10</sub> ffu/ml for Funchal population and 3.98 ± 0.88 log
 <sub>10</sub> ffu/ml for Paúl do Mar population (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). When examining TR, transmission with DENV-2 was lower than with CHIKV. TR reached a maximum at 14 dpi: 27.7% for the Funchal population and 8.3% for the Paúl do Mar population. No significant differences were detected between populations at each dpi (Chi-square test: 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 1.70, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.19 at 14 dpi). As observed with CHIKV, the number of viral particles in saliva was lower than in heads (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The maximum number of DENV particles in saliva was reached at 14 dpi: 1.81 ± 0.34 log
 <sub>10</sub> ffu/ml for the Funchal population and 1.60 ffu/ml for the Paúl do Mar population (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Both populations presented a similar number of viral particles in saliva at 14 dpi (Mann-Whitney test: 
 <italic>Z</italic> = 0.69, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.49).
