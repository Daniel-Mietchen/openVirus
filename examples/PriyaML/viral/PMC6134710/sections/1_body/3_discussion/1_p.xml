<p id="Par26">To our knowledge, this study represents the first evaluation of the vector competence of European 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations for the transmission of two arboviruses of medical importance, CHIKV and DENV. Since its arrival in 2005, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has been spreading throughout Madeira Island, increasing the risk of emergence of mosquito-borne diseases. The risk became a reality in 2012 when autochthonous cases of DENV-1 were reported in Funchal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; Venezuela in South America was the most probable origin of virus importation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. After this event, vector competence studies with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Madeira became pivotal in evaluating the risk of arboviral disease outbreak.
