<p id="Par27">Our data demonstrate that the local 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations are very susceptible to CHIKV and DENV-2 infections. Regarding CHIKV, our results showed that only three days after infection, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Madeira was able to transmit this virus suggesting that the extrinsic incubation period of CHIKV with this vector population was short, as expected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Despite high levels of viral dissemination (84–100%), 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from both localities displayed quite similar and moderate transmission rates (25–55%), with Funchal ensuring a slightly higher virus transmission at 14 dpi compared to the Paúl do Mar population. Similar results were also obtained with other populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from the Americas, with transmission ranging between 20–80% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the case of a possible chikungunya outbreak on the island, the onset of cases would be alarmingly fast, particularly in Funchal city, where most of the inhabitants live and work.
