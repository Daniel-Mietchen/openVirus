<p id="Par29">Madeira Island could be a stepping-stone for the introduction of ZIKV into Europe. The main factors are present: the vector 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, imported cases from Brazil and Venezuela [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and a na√Øve human population. Vector competence studies for ZIKV were also performed using the same 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population described in this study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that the Funchal strain was the only population showing viral particles in saliva samples [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. One should also note that the level of vector competence mostly depends on mosquito population genetics and the viral genotype used in the oral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To provide a complete risk assessment of arboviral emergence, more studies should be implemented using additional viral strains or genotypes circulating in areas neighbouring Madeira Island.
