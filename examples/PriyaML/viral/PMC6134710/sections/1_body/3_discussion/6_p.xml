<p id="Par31">This study also highlights the need for further studies to define the genetic background of the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations of Madeira. Differences observed in DENV dissemination between 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Funchal and Paúl do Mar could suggest population-based differences. Attention should be given to differential gene expression related to insecticide resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] or immunity genes which may explain the differences observed. Moreover, the natural habitat of both populations presents distinct environmental and typological conditions: Funchal is considered an urban area, with vector control activities whereas Paúl do Mar is mainly a rural area, geographically isolated from the rest of the island, and with a higher mean temperature along the year. Therefore, the role of environmental and genetic factors should be considered. Additional population genetic studies are being performed with polymorphic DNA markers to refine our knowledge about the origin, genetic differentiation, and stability of the species in the island.
