<p id="Par14">CHIKV, similar to other arboviruses, are potent inducers of interferon (INF) which in turn inhibits viral replication. Macrophages, which are a major source of INFs, are readily infected by the CHIKV and they play a pivotal role in several cellular responses, as shown in experimental studies, and in the responses of both the Th1- and Th2-type cytokines to CHIKV [
