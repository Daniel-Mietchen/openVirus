<p>The origin of the ZIKV
 <sub>SP-AM</sub> lineage was traced to French Polynesia (PSP 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>0.98) at 2013.3 (BCI 2012.9–2013.6). This lineage exhibits strong geographic subdivision; several highly supported island-specific monophyletic subclades nested among basal strains from French Polynesia (

 <sub>AM</sub> subclade (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Technical Appendix</xref> Figures 1, 2). We found 2 major clades within the ZIKV
 <sub>SP-AM</sub>; clade I (posterior probability [PP] 0.97) contains strains from French Polynesia, the Americas, New Caledonia, and Vanuatu, whereas clade II (PP 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>0.94) encloses strains from Easter Island and the Cook Islands. Zika virus strains from Fiji, American Samoa, Samoa, Tonga, and the Solomon Islands branched together in a large but not well-supported (PP 
 <underline>&lt;</underline>0.57) monophyletic group.
