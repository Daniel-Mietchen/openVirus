<p>The migration of thousands of Haitians to Brazil since the 2010 earthquake has been another important human population flow that might be associated with the introduction of new pathogens [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Our results identified the 2014 Haitian ZIKV strain [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] as the most closely related to the French Polynesian isolate placing Haiti as a possible entry point of ZIKV into the Americas, following the same path as DENV and CHIKV as previously stated [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It is important to note that this single Haitian genomic sequence could suggest that ZIKV arrived in the Caribbean islands but did not spread from there, which is in agreement with the absence of ZIKV epidemics data from the Caribbean islands back in 2014/2015. However, a recently published new genome from a patient from the USA who travelled to Haiti (KX051563_2016_02_05_USA) confirms that ZIKV is still circulating in the Caribbean islands [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The presence of this strain could be explained by the further spread of ZIKV from Brazil to the Caribbean islands after the Brazilian outbreak; however, a new Bayesian analysis with all available genomes until May 2017 confirmed that this ZIKV strain is closely related with the 2014 Haitian ZIKV sample, that is, this genome confirms that ZIKV first offset in the Americas is still circulating in the Caribbean islands (Supplementary tree).
