<p>On the other hand, ZIKV was only detected in South America in 2015, and few studies have been carried out to map its transmission dynamics. Here, possible pathways taken by ZIKV to reach different countries in mainland South America were traced. To begin, we performed minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis in order to clarify the short-range transmission route. Our MST analysis centers on the 2014 Haitian ZIKV strain [
