<p>Genotypes I and II of this virus were probably imported into South America from Puerto Rico. The red (Brazil), green (Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela), and blue (Brazil and Venezuela) clades represent DENV-4 genotype II (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(d)</xref>). DENV-4 genotype I represented by the BRA (isolate from the Bahia State, northeastern Brazil) was likely introduced into the Americas via Cambodia (KHM), thus representing a DENV of Asian origin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(d)</xref>). We also believe that this classification may also be extended to the III and IV genotypes. Analysis of DENV-4, and more specifically genotype II, indicated two main independent introductions into South America between 1990 and 1996. The first was via Cambodia to the Bahia State (northeastern Brazil) and the second in 1996 from Puerto Rico followed by several entries from Venezuela to different Brazilian states (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] already reported the possible introduction of DENV-4 genotype I into Brazil from Asia and our data indicate that genotype II followed the same route. The complexity of DENV population dynamics in South America may be associated with the multiple introduction and dissemination of new DENV variants in this region, vector density [
