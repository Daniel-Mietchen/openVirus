<p>The MCMC algorithm was run up to 1 billion generations, with sampling every 100,000 generations, for each molecular clock model. The good mixing of the MCMC was determined by effective sample size (ESS) values ≥ 200, and the convergence of parameters was assessed through of Tracer v1.6 software (

A strict molecular clock for CHIKV, DENV-1, and DENV-4 and a relaxed molecular clock for ZIKV, DENV-2, and DENV-3 were selected as the most likely models to represent the viral demographic history and were subsequently used in the following analysis. The set of trees with well-supported clades were observed through DensiTree v.2.2.544 [

Phylogenetic uncertainty was estimated by the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals. Analyses of phylogeographic patterns and viral transmission networks during outbreaks were also generated by the minimum spanning tree (MST) generated by the PHYLOViZ v.2.0 software [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The MST uses the maximum parsimony principle that evolution should be explained with as few events as possible [
