<p>To complement our ZIKV analysis due to the increasing amount of new ZIKV genomes available monthly in the databases analyzed, we constructed an updated phylogenetic tree. We downloaded all full ZIKV genomes from the ViPR database [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] deposited until May 2017. Next, we performed and obtained an alignment using MUSCLE v3.8.31 [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A phylogenetic tree was generated (285 full genomes) using MrBayes [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (GTR + I, 1 million generations).
