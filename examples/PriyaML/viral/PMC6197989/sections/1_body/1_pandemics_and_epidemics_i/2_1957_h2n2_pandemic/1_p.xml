<p id="p0020">The virus that caused the 1957 Asian flu pandemic was recognized as an influenza A virus 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> of different A subtype designated as H2N2. The 1957 pandemic, called the “Asian flu” originated in southeast China and then spread to other Asian countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong and then worldwide 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Later studies revealed that the H2N2 pandemic virus originated by the previously circulating human H1N1 acquiring novel haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and PB1 gene segments from an avian influenza virus 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Several strains of the influenza A virus related to the pandemic were isolated in Taiwan during the pandemic

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In addition, there was evidence that an antigenic drift might have occurred in the later isolates of H2N2 viruses in Taiwan 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Although H2N2 viruses have not circulated among humans since 1968, several studies have warned of the risks of the re-emergence of an H2N2 virus as a novel pandemic
