<p id="p0030">Although the 1968 pandemic strain of H3N2 adapted to humans and became a seasonal influenza virus, an H1N1 virus reappeared and caused epidemics in 1977. Because the first report of the outbreak was from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the pandemic caused by the H1N1 virus has been called the “Russian flu”. Genetic and antigenic analyses have revealed that this H1N1 virus was closely related in all eight gene segments to the H1N1 viruses isolated in humans during the 1950–51 Scandinavian epidemics 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, this virus is considered to have re-emerged from human seasonal H1N1 viruses that circulated in the 1950s. Several possibilities have been suggested for the origin and re-emergence of the H1N1 virus, including possibilities of a laboratory accident or the virus deriving from a vaccine trial attempting to generate H1N1 vaccines, possibly as a response to the 1976 swine flu incident in the USA 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Since its emergence in 1977, the H1N1 virus became a seasonal influenza virus that co-circulated with H3N2 viruses worldwide, including in Taiwan, until the novel 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus replaced this H1N1 virus.
