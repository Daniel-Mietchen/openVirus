<p id="p0015">Although Taiwan, which comprises several islands located in the western Pacific Ocean, is relatively isolated from other countries, influenza pandemics have still affected its inhabitants. During the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Taiwan was governed by Japan. Previous studies have noted that this pandemic may have caused more than 25,000 deaths in Taiwan

Similar to the transmission route of the 1918 influenza virus in the United States, this H1N1 virus may have initially spread in military bases or through migration of troops. According to the reports of a Japanese medical officer Arai Megumi in 1918–19 [

During the pandemic, schools in Taiwan were closed for several days because of the high infection rate and prevalence of severe respiratory symptoms among students and faculty members. In contrast to Western countries, the mortality rate for young children (aged less than 5 years) was higher than that for young adults (aged 20–30 years)

Insufficient public hygiene and low health care standards during this period may have contributed to the high mortality rate of the pandemic; further research is required to elucidate the statistics regarding disease severity and mortality related to the pandemic. The high mortality rate among infected individuals may have been a result of the low-quality health care system, including a lack of physicians and an excessive burden on the health care system
