<p id="p0035">In 2009, two patients with human respiratory illness in Southern California were identified to be infected with a novel H1N1 influenza A virus that was genetically similar to the swine-origin H1N1 viruses 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This pandemic which started in Mexico rapidly spread to other countries. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the virus, later named A (H1N1)pdm09, was generated by genetic reassortment with gene segments being derived from North American avian, human H3N2, classic swine, and Eurasian swine influenza A viruses

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In Taiwan, the first case of human infection with A (H1N1)pdm09 was reported in May 2009 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Because of the lack of prior immunity to this virus, especially in younger children, the novel virus spread rapidly in Taiwan 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> in the second half of 2009. Another A (H1N1)pdm09 outbreak occurred in the following winter season of 2010/2011, with less number of viruses being isolated. Interestingly, the severe influenza and pneumonia/influenza related death from this virus seemed to be more prominent in the first few weeks in 2011 rather than those in 2009 when it was firstly introduced into Taiwan (

It is possible that the virological diagnostic effort was more vigorous in 2009 and more cases were diagnosed with clinical criteria in 2011. Because of the SARS outbreak that had occurred in Taiwan in 2003, Taiwan was adequately prepared for managing pandemics 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Interventions used in response to the pandemic included school closures 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In addition, vaccines and rapid diagnostic tests were made widely available in 2009

In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the end of the H1N1 pandemic, the A (H1N1)pdm09 virus now being recognized as a seasonal influenza virus. At the time of writing this review, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus has replaced the previous seasonal H1N1 virus that circulated from 1977 up to 2009 in Taiwan
