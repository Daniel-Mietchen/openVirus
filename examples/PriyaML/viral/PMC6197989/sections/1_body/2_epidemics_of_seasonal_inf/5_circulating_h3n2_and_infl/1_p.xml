<p id="p0065">The H3N2 virus circulated in the 2016–17 flu season in Taiwan and caused a summer epidemic in the late stage of the season

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> [
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>]. Research has further indicated that an antigenic change was not the primary determinant of this H3N2 summer epidemic; rather, changes in fitness levels, reduced immunity, and climatic changes were possible contributors 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. After this summer epidemic, influenza B viruses were the dominant viruses in the 2017–18 flu season, causing 610 severe infections and 88 deaths from October 2017 to March 2018 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Notably, an unusually early influenza epidemic caused by the H3N2 virus co-circulating with the Yamagata lineage of influenza B viruses occurred during this period in Canada 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. According to an Australian study 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, the H3N2 outbreak in 2017 was due to low vaccine efficacy. At the time of writing this review, this epidemic still prevailed, and thus further research is necessary to improve influenza vaccines. In conclusion, although the timing of influenza epidemics and the evolutionary pattern of influenza viruses remain unpredictable, recent computational techniques and sequencing platforms have provided a real-time and highly effective method for analyzing the rapid evolution of influenza viruses. Improving our understanding of and capacity to predict the evolution of influenza viruses could lead to the development of superior techniques for public health surveillance and effective recommendations for influenza vaccine strains in future seasons.
