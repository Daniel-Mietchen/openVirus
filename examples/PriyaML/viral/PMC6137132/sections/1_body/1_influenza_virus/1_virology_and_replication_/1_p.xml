<p>Influenza viruses are members of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. Their genome is comprised of a negative sense, segmented single-stranded RNA. Viral particles also contain essential viral proteins and a host cell-derived envelope (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Influenza viruses are further classified into four types: A, B, C, and D. Influenza virus types A, B, and C infect and cause respiratory illness in humans. Influenza D viruses mainly affect cattle and are not known to infect humans (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics whereas type C viruses usually cause a mild upper respiratory tract illness and associated epidemics have only been scarcely reported (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Influenza A viruses can infect many animal species, including birds, pigs, horses, marine mammals, and other hosts, and can cause pandemics. Influenza A viruses are categorized into subtypes based on the molecular characteristics of their surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA). Identification of at least 18 antigenically distinct HA subtypes and 11 distinct NA subtypes of influenza A virus strains infecting humans and animals have so far been determined (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Two genetically and antigenically distinct lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) of Influenza B viruses co-circulate in humans (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
