<p>What determines the viral bottleneck size? Small viral founding populations are usually observed, even though this depends on the virus and the host (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Experimental studies in ferret and guinea pig showed that influenza infections coming from limited dose of aerosol exposure had tighter bottlenecks than contact transmission (
