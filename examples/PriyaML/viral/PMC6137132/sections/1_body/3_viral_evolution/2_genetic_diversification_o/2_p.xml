<p>The major cause of the high evolutionary rate of influenza viruses is the lack of proofreading (correction) function of the viral RNA polymerase. Mutagenesis is close to 10
 <sup>−3</sup>-10
 <sup>−4</sup> per nucleotide site, this being a very high mutagenesis rate and producing a high genetic variability in the viral genetic pool (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Another consequence of the continuously evolved viral genetic variability is the increased probability for widening the host-range of the virus due to HA protein changes (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).
