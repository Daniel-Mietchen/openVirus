  <p>Schematic representation of the differential roles of various ANX family members. ANXA1 promotes viral attachment and endosomal trafficking, thereby enhancing viral replication. ANXA2 incorporates into IAV envelope to convert plasminogen to plasmin, which cleaves HA to facilitate replication. Similarly, ANXA5 acts as an alternative receptor that mediates IAV entry into the cells. Together, these members of the ANX family enhance the replication of virus in infected cells. On the contrary, ANXA6 restricts virus replication by binding to the M2 protein of IAV or by creating an imbalance of cholesterol homeostasis in the late endosome, which prevent viral and endosomal membrane fusion and subsequent export of the vRNP into the nucleus.</p>
