<p>Unlike the previously described members of the ANX family, Annexin A6 (ANXA6) is reported to negatively impact IAV replication during infection. The first evidence on the possible role of ANXA6 in influenza virus infection was its ability to interact with the viral M2 protein to repress replication. IAV M2 protein is essential in the entry and late stage of the viral lifecycle (
