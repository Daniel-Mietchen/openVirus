<p>The inability of vaccines to induce broad range protection against IAV in circulation, and a possible event of a mutated virus coming into circulation makes the development of therapies that enhance host antiviral mechanisms very desirable. Over the years, considerable efforts have been spent on understanding the roles of various ANX molecules in several infectious diseases, which has been carefully reviewed (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Kuehnl et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Schloer et al., 2018</xref>). To this effect, it can be concluded that ANXs represent very important molecules that are potential targets for further development in the treatment of IAV (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). As most ANX family members function in the viral entry stage during IAV infection, a broad neutralizing antibody against the ANXA1, ANXA2, and ANXA5 appears to be a suitable option for the treatment of IAV infection in order to lessen the mortality and morbidity associated with the disease. Prevention of the entry phase of the virus infection cycle will thus prevent viral replication and the excessive inflammatory side effects associated with it.
