<p>Annexins are a family of calcium or phospholipid binding molecules found mostly in eukaryotes but absent in yeasts and prokaryotes (

 <sup>2+</sup> and membrane-binding modules with conserved four or eight repeat units of amino acids and an N-terminal domain with greatest sequence variation between families (

 <sup>2+</sup>dependent roles at cellular membranes, ANXs can influence other processes such as inflammation, signaling, and proliferation (
