<p>ANXA1 was first discovered as a phospholipase A2 inhibitor (then known as macrocortin or renocortin) (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Cloix et al., 1983</xref>) and is well-known for its role as an anti-inflammatory, glucocorticoid-inducible molecule (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Perretti and Dâ€™Acquisto, 2009</xref>). In early studies in numerous animal models of inflammation, administration of ANXA1 or its N-terminal bioactive peptides exerted anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and anti-migratory effects (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Morimoto et al., 2006</xref>). In recent years, ANXA1 is shown to redirect M1 macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, decreasing the expression on inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha (
