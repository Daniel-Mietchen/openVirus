<p>Recent studies have shown that IAV infection induces the upregulation of FPR2 in lungs and murine macrophages by stimulating the production of type I interferons (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ampomah et al., 2017</xref>). Type I interferon activates the interferon-αβ-receptor and activates signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3), which induces FPR2 expression. Inhibiting this FPR2 induction pathway reduced viral loads, indicating that upregulation of FPR2 may be essential for virus replication and propagation (Figure
