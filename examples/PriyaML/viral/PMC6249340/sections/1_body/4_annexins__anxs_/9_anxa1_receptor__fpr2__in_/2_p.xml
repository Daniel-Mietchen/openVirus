<p>One of the earliest reports to implicate FPR2 in IAV infection demonstrated that activation of FPR2 by its ligand WKYMVm-NH2, followed by IAV infection, enhanced pathogenesis and virus replication, while inhibition of FPR2 by its antagonist WRW4, repressed viral replication (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In this context, it is plausible that secreted ANXA1 can enhance viral replication by activating FPR2, which consequently induces cellular activation of ERK (
