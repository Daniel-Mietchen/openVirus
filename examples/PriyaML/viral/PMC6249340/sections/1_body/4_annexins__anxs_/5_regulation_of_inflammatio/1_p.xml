<p>With the growing research around this fascinating molecule, many groups have reported the double-edged sword property of ANXA1. Inflammatory conditions can result in the cleavage of full-length ANXA1 (37 kDa) to the cleaved isoform (33 kDa) and the N terminal peptide by proteinase-3 and neutrophil elastase (

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2010</xref>). Whereas ANXA1 mediates its function via the FPR2, the ANXA1-derived N terminal peptide can activate all three isoforms of FPR (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Cooray et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, ANXA1 can be phosphorylated (

 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Creutz, 1992</xref>) and sumoylated (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Caron et al., 2013</xref>), which further confounds its activity.
