<p>Conflicting reports on the role of ANXA1 in promoting inflammation have recently emerged. Dendritic cells from ANXA1
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice stimulated with LPS, a TLR4 agonist exhibited impaired migration, decreased maturation, and lower pro-inflammatory cytokine production which was associated with impaired NF-κB signaling and a reduced ability to stimulate the adaptive immune response (

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice stimulated with TLR3 or TLR4 agonists produced less interferon beta (IFNβ) and interferon-stimulated genes, through an association of the C-terminus of ANXA1 with TANK-binding kinase 1, leading to IRF3 phosphorylation (
