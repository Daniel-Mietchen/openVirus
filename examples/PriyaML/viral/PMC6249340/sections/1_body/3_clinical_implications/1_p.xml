<p>At present, there are two fundamental approaches to managing the influenza epidemic: vaccination and, treatment using antivirals. Several influenza vaccines are available with several modes of administration such as forms of nasal sprays, intradermal injections, and flu jet injectors (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). These vaccines often achieve up to 80% efficacy against homologous strains but become less effective in the elderly population and against heterologous IAV strains. However, the high mutability of the IAV and the sizeable antigenic diversity of viral strains emphasize the need to formulate new vaccines annually (

Amantadine and rimantadine target the IAV M2 proteins, to inhibit uncoating of the virus, while oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir target NA to prevent virus spread (

However, the emergence of resistant virus strains has rendered M2 inhibitors useless, and there is growing resistance against NA inhibitors such as the H274Y mutation found in the 2009 H1N1 strain that made the virus oseltamivir-resistant (
