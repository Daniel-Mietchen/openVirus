<p>This shows that the choice of appropriate historical data is the cornerstone of any such attempt. Yet little is known regarding the comparative epidemiology of diseases in the same or similar places and on the condition where transportability can be assumed. For influenza, it has been reported that the reproduction ratios in two successive flu pandemics (1889 and 1918) showed substantial correlation (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.62) in the same US cities, even years apart [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. For 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases, comparisons of ZIKV and dengue virus outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and of ZIKV with CHIKV outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] in the same locations have highlighted similarities in the epidemic dynamics. In any case, careful consideration of all the factors that may influence transmission and reporting is needed. For example, contrary to CHIKV, some cases of sexual transmission have been reported for ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Yet, no epidemics were seen in locations without enough 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, as for example in metropolitan France, despite the introductions of several hundreds ZIKV infected cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This justifies the use of CHIKV epidemic data to provide prior information on ZIKV in the epidemic context considered here. More generally, documenting, analyzing and comparing more systematically past epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] is necessary to provide the data required to derive prior information. In particular, informed with epidemiological records of the recent CHIKV and ZIKV epidemics, our approach could be applied to potential future emergences of other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases such as Mayaro virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], Ross River virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] or Usutu virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] once transportability is deemed plausible.
