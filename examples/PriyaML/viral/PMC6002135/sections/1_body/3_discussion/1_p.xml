<p>Obtaining reliable model-based forecasts in real time at the beginning of an epidemic is a difficult endeavour. It is however precisely during these periods that forecasts may have the most impact to guide interventions. Here, we compared several approaches to provide forecasts for ZIKV epidemics from an early point in a retrospective analysis of the outbreaks that occurred in the French West Indies in 2015â€“2017. We found that the accuracy and sharpness of the forecasts before peak incidence were substantially improved when
