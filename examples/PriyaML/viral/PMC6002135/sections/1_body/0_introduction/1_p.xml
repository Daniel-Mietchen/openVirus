<p>Model-based assessments must be done in real time for emerging outbreaks: this was the case in recent years for MERS-CoV in the Middle East [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006526.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in the Americas. These analyses often focused on transmissibility and reproduction numbers rather than on forecasting the future impact of the epidemic. Indeed, forecasting is difficult before the epidemic reaches its peak, all the more when information on natural history, transmissibility and under-reporting is limited [
