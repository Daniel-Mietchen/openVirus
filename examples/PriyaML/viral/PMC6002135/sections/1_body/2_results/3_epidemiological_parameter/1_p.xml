 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006526.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the future course of the ZIKV epidemics predicted using data available two weeks after date “
 <italic>S</italic>” in each island, for the three choices of prior distributions. At this week, predictions with the NI priors were largely off-target, overestimating the future magnitude of the epidemic in all three islands. Using the R priors reduced the gap between forecasts and future observation. Major improvements in both 
 <italic>accuracy</italic> and 
 <italic>sharpness</italic> were obtained only with L priors. These results were typical of the initial phase of the epidemics, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006526.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Overall, the quality of the forecasts improved as 
 <italic>K</italic> increases in all three islands and also as prior distributions brought more specific information. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that L priors defined here outperformed or performed at least equivalently to the alternative priors definition tested (
