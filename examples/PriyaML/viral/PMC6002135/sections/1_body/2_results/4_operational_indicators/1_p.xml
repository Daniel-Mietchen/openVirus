<p>The forecasts of the four indicators of operational interest produced before peak incidence were contrasted. With NI priors, forecasts of total epidemic size overestimated the final counts by on average 3.3 times (range: 0.2 to 5.8) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006526.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), with substantial variations in the forecasts from one week to the next. For instance in Martinique, projections varied from 105,000 total observed cases (95% prediction interval [95%PI]: 5,300–340,000) on February 7th to 8,100 (95%PI: 5,700–13,700) on February 14th. For the same indicator, forecasts using the R priors were only 1.7 times too high (range: 0.4 to 3.3) and those produced using L priors were only 1.1 times too high (range: 0.4 to 1.5). As a comparison, with the L priors on February 7th, the forecast of epidemic size was 47,200 (95%PI: 20,900–71,100) in Martinique, much closer to the final count of 37,400 observed cases at the end of the epidemic in this island.
