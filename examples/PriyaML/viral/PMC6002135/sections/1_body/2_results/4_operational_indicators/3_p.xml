<p>Forecasting the dates of interest in the epidemics showed mixed results, with less differences depending on the choice of priors. The forecasts of the date of peak incidence were too late by on average 1.0 month (range: -3.4 to +3.9) using the NI priors, with large variations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006526.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Forecasts were only slightly better with the R priors (+0.7 months, range: âˆ’2.1 to +2.8) and the L priors (+0.9 months, range: -1.1 to +3.2), but sharper. Better forecasts were obtained for Martinique than for the other islands.
