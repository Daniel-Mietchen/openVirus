<p>Similarly, forecasts of maximal weekly (observed) incidence produced before date “
 <italic>P</italic>” were generally too large when using NI priors, on average 15.3 times higher than the actual maximal weekly incidence observed thereafter (range: 2.0 to 63.1) and with large fluctuations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006526.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Using informative prior distributions improved the forecasts, reducing the maximum predicted incidence to 7.5 times higher (range: 3.0 to 25.5) with the R priors and 2.4 times higher (range: 1.3 to 3.9) with the L priors. In all cases, forecasts of maximal incidence were never smaller than actual incidence.
