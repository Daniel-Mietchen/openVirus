<p>The ZIKV outbreaks in Guadeloupe, Martinique and Saint-Martin were modelled separately using a dynamic discrete-time SIR model within a Bayesian framework. Briefly, the two main components of the model were: (i) a mechanistic reconstruction of the distribution of the serial interval of the disease (the time interval between disease onset in a primary case and a secondary case) that allows bypassing vector compartments; (ii) a transmission model for the generation of observed secondary cases in the human host. The generation time distribution was reconstructed by estimating the durations of each part of the infection cycle using disease- and mosquito-specific data from the literature, and assuming a fixed local temperature of 28Â°
 <italic>C</italic>, as described in more detail in the supplementary appendix. This led to gamma distributions with mean 2.5 weeks (standard deviation: 0.7) for ZIKV and with mean 1.6 weeks (sd: 0.6) for CHIKV.
