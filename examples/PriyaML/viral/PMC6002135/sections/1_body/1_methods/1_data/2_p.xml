<p>We then analyzed historical data on the spread of emerging 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases in similar locations. CHIKV epidemics occured in the same three islands during 2013â€“2015. Both diseases were transmitted by the same vector (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>), circulated in the same immunologically naive populations within a period of two years, had the same kind of clinical signs (i.e., fever, rash and arthralgia) and were reported by the same surveillance system. Surveillance data on CHIKV epidemics in the French West Indies was available from local health authorities (

Finally, we also selected the ZIKV and CHIKV epidemics that occured in six islands or archipelagoes of French Polynesia between 2013 and 2017, as they provided information on the differences between the two diseases.
