<p>The following assumptions were used given the lack of specific experimental data, but further efforts to produce the data can be done to address the issues listed here: 
 <list list-type="simple">

   <label>(i)</label>
   <p>Secondary antibody responses were assumed to be similar to primary responses. This underestimates the effect of vaccination strategies conducted before an epidemic. Experimental studies on secondary immune responses to EBOV infection are needed, especially those with a longer follow-up period.</p>

   <label>(ii)</label>
   <p>The transmission potential was assumed as directly related to viral load. While this is reasonable, non-linear relationships might exist [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Dedicated animal experiments to define the exact relationship between the viral load and the ability to transmit the virus are needed.

   <label>(iii)</label>
   <p>The contact pattern was assumed similar for Ebola affected regions as in European countries. Although the contact patterns seemed similar across countries [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], a more sociable population would have higher contact rate and thus increase R0. As collecting this data for all countries can be laborious, simulation studies addressing the effect of contact patterns on the connectivity in network models are needed.

   <label>(iv)</label>
   <p>Infection status was assumed to have no influence on the network structure, except that those buried were removed from the network. This could overestimate R0 [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Taking peopleâ€™s behaviour changes into epidemic modelling remains a grand challenge [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].
   </p>

   <label>(v)</label>
   <p>Susceptibility to EBOV infection was assumed similar to a general viral infection disease. Studies on susceptibility functions are lacking and require more attention of the infection research community.</p>
