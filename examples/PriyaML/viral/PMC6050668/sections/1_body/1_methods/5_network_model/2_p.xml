<p>Because EBOV spreads through direct contacts with infectious subjects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and the highest risk of infection is contacting with blood, faeces, and vomit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], we used only the data of physical contacts and excluded those contacts with a duration of less than five minutes. In the 2014 EBOV epidemic, an important transmission route was through contacting with the deceased who had not been buried [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To account for this we considered deceased EBOV-infected subjects as infectious until they were buried. During the 2015 EBOV epidemic, the time from death to burial was from one to two days on average, but it can be a week [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This information was used to formulate a truncated normal distribution for the time from death to burial, i.e., the distribution was truncated at zero and seven and had unit mean and variance (detailed implementations can be seen in Availability of data and materials).
