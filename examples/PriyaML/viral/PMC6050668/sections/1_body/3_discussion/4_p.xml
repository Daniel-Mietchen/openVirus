<p>Different classes of network models have been proposed, but they cannot reproduce properties observed in real world networks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. In addition, choices of theoretical network structure used for simulation can alter epidemic outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, a network model built from empirical data would provide a more solid ground for epidemic simulations. Apart from mimicking the contact data properties, our network model can express age-related infection traits via the assigned age attribute. It was used in this paper to express individual differences in the susceptibility and immune response to viral infectionâ€”the crucial elements in a realistic disease transmission. Although contact data might not be available for a certain target area, the assortative patterns of human contacts and the highly skewed distribution of the number of contacts might hold true across regions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Thus, this paper presents a simple way to bring empirical contact data into epidemic modelling studies.
