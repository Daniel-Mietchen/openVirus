<p>In estimating parameters and designing prevention strategies for infectious diseases, it is important to take into account mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity in immune responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and in the population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This paper combined a within-host immunological model of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection and an age- and demographic-specfic contact network to study EBOV epidemic. The multi-scale model reproduced major characteristics of EBOV epidemics and allowed finer assessments of the timing of vaccination strategies.
