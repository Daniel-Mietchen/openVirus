<p id="Par40">The attempt to eliminate the YF during the twenty-first century, despite a relative failure, probably contained the risk of urban and peri-urban epidemics. For more than 50 years, Brazilian YF epidemics – and the most recent one was no exception – were sylvatic and involved wild vectors (

 <italic>Sabethes</italic>, as well as non-anthropophilic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, i.e. other species than 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>) and spared densely populated areas. So far, humans have been infected outside cities and their suburbs from multiple sylvatic foci [

However, the sylvatic cycle is expanding, and getting closer to the cities, infesting forest areas that could even be included in the conurbations of southern Brazil, notably in the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, highlighting the risk of metropolitan epidemics.

The “syndromic surveillance” approach recommended by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention increases the sensitivity – and specificity – of first-line clinical detection [
