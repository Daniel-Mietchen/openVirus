<p id="Par36">The absence of YF from Asia and Oceania remains an enigma. The population is susceptible to the virus as shown by Asian patients living in endemic areas (Africa or South America). 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, although a recent arrival, is present in many places in Asia and Oceania. In addition, the abundant circulation of other arboviruses, dengue, chikungunya and Zika, the latter two coming from Africa like YF, indicates the possibility of YF extension in Asia. Recently, several human cases of YF introduced from Angola have been diagnosed in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>], increasing YF outbreak fears. Several studies attempted to explain the absence of YF in Asia. The following main reasons were given: a) poor competency of the vector for the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>], b) poor adaptation of the vector to humans and competition between vectors (Abrão and Fonseca, 2006, quoted in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]), c) competition between Flavoviridae in the vector at the expense of YF and d) cross-reactivity with other Flavoviridae, including dengue fever, in humans and other animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. Recent modeling of YF risk in Asia showed that two major factors limited the probability of YF expansion in Asia (“Asian hypothesis”) and dengue fever in Africa (“African hypothesis”) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. The first was based on cross-immunity between Flavoviridae – especially between dengue and YF, which could limit the risk of double infection – and high viremia and severe clinical forms of YF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. The second was based on the competition between 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> as well as on their respective competencies in the transmission of dengue and YF to explain the absence of the latter in Asia and the rarity of the former in Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. Another explanation was the low probability of transporting the virus from Africa – or the Americas – to Asia and the Pacific. The slave trade to Asia was much smaller than the trade to the Americas. This reduces the probability – as to the transport of the virus into the Americas before air transport – by infected humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. Mosquito transport did not occur, either from Africa or America, for reasons that have not yet been elucidated.
