<p id="Par28">Despite common ecological conditions in the Amazonian region, there are two lineages of the YF virus: genotype 1 from Brazil (or possibly from the West Indies) and genotype 2 from Peru [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. A strong genetic heterogeneity of the virus has been developing for some 30 years, increasing since the 2000s, probably as a result of human migrations that play a role of both gene mixing and viral dispersal [
