<p id="p0095">In conclusion, increasing efforts targeting infectious disease studies in Africa have identified new infectious agents. It concerns not only bacterial and viral diseases but also protozoal and helminthic ones. For instance, a new genetic variant of

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. It is evident that Africa is characterized by the greatest infectious disease burden as well as by the weakest public health infrastructure in the world; further, efforts to establish public health infrastructures that are actually effective may take a period of years, even decades. Emerging infectious diseases should be identified as priority diseases. The challenge will be to combine surveillance and epidemic preparedness and response activities for these priority diseases. Evidently this task is quite difficult because the infrastructure and level of support for surveillance, research and training on emerging infectious diseases in Africa are limited. Laboratory-based surveillance and targeted research surveys to identify common sources of infection in different community types would allow a unified approach to target this enormous challenge. We are persuaded that the most important step towards the elimination of existing burden of infectious diseases in Africa is a massive increase in the number of qualified personnel, including both physicians and scientists.
