 <italic>Rickettsia felis</italic> was reported for the first time in the United States and was officially described in 2002. Before 2010, the bacterium was mainly found in arthropods, especially in cat fleas, 
 <italic>Ctenocephalides felis,</italic> with a worldwide distribution. It was also considered as a rare cause of rickettsial spotted fever transmitted by fleas. Only about 70 described human cases of infection due to 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> have been reported. In 2010, two studies conducted in Senegal and Kenya by two independent teams showed a prevalence of about 4% of 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> DNA in blood samples of febrile individuals without malaria (

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. A more consistent study, involving 2024 febrile and 391 afebrile subjects, confirmed the role of 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> in fever in Senegal 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> was also detected in eschar samples (5/68, 7.4%) and skin swabs (3/60, 5%) from healthy Senegalese villagers 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The presence of 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> was also observed in faecal samples from Senegalese villagers (8/451) 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In Gabon, 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> was detected in blood samples of febrile patients, reaching a prevalence of 39.7% in the rural area of Fougamou 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The bacterium was also detected in the rural area of Lastourville (11.2%) and, less frequently, in the city areas of Koulamoutou (2.1%) and Franceville (1.3%) 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Overall, 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> is commonly detected in febrile patients in sub-Saharan Africa. 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> is also usually detected in cat fleas, although not in Senegal 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> mosquitoes are suspected to transmit the bacterium; this was strongly supported by a recent experimental model 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> was also detected in a nonhaematophagous ubiquitous household pest, the booklouse 
 <italic>Liposcelis bostrychophila,</italic> which also may play a role in the 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> transmission 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, an experimental model remained to be developed to better determine its role. Moreover, the omnipresence of 
 <italic>L. bostrychophila</italic> in households and its 100% level of 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> infection may explain the occasional detection of 
 <italic>R. felis</italic> on healthy skin 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Other rickettsial diseases also may be considered to be neglected and emerging diseases in Africa
