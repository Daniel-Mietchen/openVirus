<p id="p0060">Yellow fever virus is a mosquito-borne 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) causing infection in humans, with symptoms ranging from mild nonspecific illness to severe disease with jaundice, haemorrhage and death 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. A single-dose vaccine has available since the 1940s. It has allowed virus transmission to be controlled and substantially reduced. However, the sylvatic cycle of the virus prevents its eradication. In this sylvatic cycle, nonhuman primates act as primary hosts, and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are responsible for transmission to people. Lack or intermittence of vaccination campaigns, mainly in low-income and/or politically unstable countries, is another factor that can explain the failure to eradicate yellow fever in Africa (

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Since 2000, numerous outbreaks of yellow fever have been observed in West Africa, the Horn of Africa and east-central Africa (

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Since 2008, an increased number of cases have been also reported in Central African countries, raising the question of whether these reports were related to better surveillance or a real increase in disease

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Finally, regardless of the cause of the uptick in reports (surveillance improvements or epidemic), the root cause remains the same: a lack of sustained vaccination in the human population.
