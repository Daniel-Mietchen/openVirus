<p id="p0080">Zika virus is another 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (family 
 <italic>Flaviridae</italic>) transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. The virus was first detected in April 1947 in a febrile sentinel rhesus macaque monkey in the Zika forest on the shores of Lake Victoria (Uganda) 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The first human case was diagnosed in 1962–1963 in Uganda. Overall, data currently support a silent transmission of Zika virus among humans, mosquitoes and animals throughout tropical Africa for more than 70 years without reports of epidemic 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In 2007, the first epidemic occurred in the Pacific (Yap Island, Micronesia). The second epidemic affected Polynesia in 2013. The first outbreak of Zika virus in Africa was detected in 2015 in Cabo Verde (

 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Sexual transmission was first suspected in an American citizen returning from Senegal and then was confirmed after its emergence in the Americas 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The link between Zika virus and severe malformations of the central nervous system (particularly microcephaly) has been demonstrated by many studies in Brazil and has been reported retrospectively in French Polynesia 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Genetic differences between African and Asian/American strains of Zika virus and appearance of the ‘pathogenic clone’ may explain the emergence of Zika virus infections in South America and Asia
