 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al. (2017)</xref> studied the effects of the commonly observed epidemic ZIKV amino acid substitutions in C, prM, E, NS1, and NS5 viral proteins to assess their roles in enhancing viral replication efficiency. They found that among all mutants examined, a serine to asparagine amino acid substitution (S139N) of ZIKV prM protein, which is observed in most human epidemic strains, exhibited the greatest neurovirulence in neonatal mice. On reversing the substitution from asparagine to serine (N139S) in the epidemic strain, N139S mutants were less neurovirulent than S139N. Moreover, when human neural progenitor cells (hNPC) were infected with either the S139N or N139S mutant, the S139N mutant elicited more cell death than the N139S mutant or pre-epidemic Asian wild type virus. These findings suggest that this serine to asparagine amino acid substitution in epidemic strains may have contributed to the recently observed congenital birth defects associated with ZIKV outbreaks in Brazil (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al. (2017)</xref> studied only two amino acid substitutions in prM. More work is needed to identify other genetic factors contributing to pathogenesis since the N139S reverse substitution only reduced neurovirulence and did not completely prevent it.
