<p id="Par17">In addition, there was a decrease in the accumulation rate of vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA in MDCK cells infected with the 2016–2017win viruses at 35 °C and 37 °C compared with that in cells infected with the 2017sum and 2014 H3N2 viruses after 24 hpi; this result was consistent with those from the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> measurement and HA assay. Combined with our genome-wide analysis, we found one mutation in the NS gene that might result in a decrease in the growth rate of the 2016–2017win viruses. The N127S mutation identified in NS1 has not been reported previously; however, this position had been confirmed to be part of the PKR-binding site of the NS1 protein (position 123–127)

 </sup>. The influenza virus NS1 protein plays a key role in blocking the activation of PKR during influenza infection and interacts with the viral polymerase to mediate the temporal regulation of vRNA synthesis during infection. Mutants of NS1 with mutations at position 123/124 or 126/127 do not bind PKR, and mutations at position 123/124 can result in the deregulation of vRNA synthesis, resulting in attenuated influenza virus replication

 </sup>. There has been no report regarding mutations at position 127 of NS1, but our data were consistent with the results of the analysis of mutations at position 123/124 of the NS1 protein. We hypothesize that the decrease in the RNA accumulation and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> value in cells infected with the 2016–2017win viruses may result from the N127S mutation in the NS1 protein. Viruses with the N127S mutation may lose the ability to interact with the viral polymerase and exhibit low synthesis of vRNA at the early infection stage.
