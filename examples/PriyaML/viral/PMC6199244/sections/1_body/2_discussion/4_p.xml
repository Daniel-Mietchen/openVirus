<p id="Par16">Furthermore, we demonstrated that the temperature sensitivity of the 2016–2017win viruses was conferred by a mutation in the influenza polymerase PA subunit. Introducing a single substitution at residue 668 of the PA gene induced a strong attenuation of polymerase activity at 39 °C, whereas the substitutions at residues 299 and 340 of PB2 had little influence on the polymerase activity at different temperatures. The mechanism by which the PA I668V mutation suppressed polymerase activity at high temperatures was not elucidated. Temperature-sensitive mutations fall into two general classes: those generating thermolabile proteins and those generating defects in protein synthesis, folding or assembly

 </sup>, suggesting that this mutation may belong to the latter class. Previous research has confirmed that this helix (residues 657–716) is required for binding to the N terminus of PB1, suggesting that residue 668 may be involved in protein–protein interactions and may affect polymerase assembly

 </sup>. This finding is consistent with our results showing that polymerases of both the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses with the PA I668V residue exhibit reduced activity at high temperatures. The I668V mutation may regulate the PA-PB1 interaction or inhibit polymerase function.
