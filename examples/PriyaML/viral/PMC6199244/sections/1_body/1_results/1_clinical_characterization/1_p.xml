<p id="Par5">Sixty-two patients were diagnosed with a H3N2 influenza virus infection from Nov. 2016 to Sep. 2017: 28 patients in the 2016–2017 winter season (from Nov. 2016 to Mar. 2017) and 34 patients in the 2017 summer season (from May 2017 to Sep. 2017). We divided all of the viral strains isolated from influenza-infected patients into two groups: the 2016–2017win virus strains and 2017sum virus strains. The median age of the hosts of the 2016–2017win strains was 66, with ages ranging from 19 to 94, while the median age of the hosts of the 2017sum strains was 70, with ages ranging from 33 to 90 years. Of the 62 patients, 33 (53.2%) were male and 48 (77.4%) were elderly (≥60 years). Influenza-like symptoms (i.e., temperature ≥ 38 °C, cough, or sore throat) were observed in all patients who were subsequently diagnosed with influenza A by real-time RT-PCR. No significant differences were observed in gender, age, underlying condition, or outcome between the two groups. The vaccination rate in Shanghai during 2016–2017 is unclear, but previous studies have suggested that the rate might be relatively low (approximately 2–16%)
