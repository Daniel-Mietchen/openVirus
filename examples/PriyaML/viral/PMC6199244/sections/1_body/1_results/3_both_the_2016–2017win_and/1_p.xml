<p id="Par8">To investigate the mechanism by which seasonal H3N2 mutations influence viral replication, we determined the viral titers based on the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> at a series of time points post infection (12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h) and on the quantities of viral RNA (vRNA), cRNA and viral mRNA in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells infected with the 2016–2017win and 2017sum viral strains at a series of time points post infection (0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h). Multiple-cycle growth curves of the 2016–2017win, 2017sum and 2014 H3N2 viral strains in MDCK cells are shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>. All of the viral strains replicated efficiently at 33 °C. There were no significant differences among the replication efficiencies of the 2016–2017win, 2017sum or 2014 H3N2 viruses at 33 °C, with mean titers ranging from 10
 <sup>7.9</sup> to 10
 <sup>8.3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml at 96hpi, and vRNA, cRNA and mRNA were present at high levels in all of the viruses. The HA titers were determined at 96hpi. The results of the HA assay indicated that the 2016–2017win strains may replicate slightly more efficiently than the 2017sum strains at 33 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). The vRNA levels of all of the strains at 96hpi and 33 °C were higher than those at other temperatures (35, 37, and 39 °C).
