<p id="Par12">To understand the effects of the PB2 and PA mutations in the 2016–2017win and 2017sum virus strains, we introduced three individual mutations, as summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> (PB2 R299K, PB2 R340K, and PA I668V), into the reassortant polymerase complex from the 2017sum viruses. In human 293T cells, both mutations in PB2 led to similar activities at 33 °C, 37 °C and 39 °C, which was consistent with the polymerase complex of the 2017sum strains. However, the polymerase reconstituted with the PA I668V mutant exhibited significantly reduced activity, a feature that was generally more pronounced at 39 °C than at 33 °C or 37 °C. To verify the decrease in the activity of the PA I668V mutant at 39 °C, an A/Sichuan/1/2009 virus polymerase complex containing the PA I668V mutation (SC/09 PA-I668V) was constructed, and the activity was measured in transfected cells. We compared the activities of the polymerase complexes of the SC/09 virus with the amino acid substitutions in the PA gene via polymerase activity assays. Compared to the polymerase activity of SC/09, the isoleucine-to-valine substitution in the mutant PA I668V of the H1N1 subtype resulted in lower polymerase activity at 39 °C, which was consistent with the PA mutant polymerase complex of the H3N2 subtype (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). These results suggested that the temperature sensitivity of the 2016–2017win viruses was associated with a defect in the replication activity of the polymerase and that the PA I668V mutant might potentially lead to reduced polymerase activity at high temperatures.
