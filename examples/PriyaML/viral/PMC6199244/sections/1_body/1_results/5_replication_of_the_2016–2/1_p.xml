<p id="Par10">To determine whether the amino acid mutations of the 2016–2017win and 2017sum viral strains influenced the replication of these viruses at high temperatures, we determined the viral titer and RNA levels of the 2016–2017win, 2017sum and 2014 H3N2 viruses at 39 °C. The 2017sum viruses maintained a mean titer of 10
 <sup>6.3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml at 39 °C, while the 2016–2017win viruses replicated to a mean titer of 10
 <sup>3.4</sup>TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml at 39 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). The results of the HA assay were consistent with the viral TCID
 <sub>50</sub> titers; the HA titer of the 2017sum viruses was significantly higher than that of the 2016–2017win viruses. Meanwhile, the accumulation of vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA in cells infected with the 2017sum viruses was significantly higher than those in cells infected with the 2016–2017win viruses at 39 °C after 24 hpi. RNA replication of the 2016–2017win viruses was restricted by more than 100-fold at 39 °C compared to that at 35 °C and 37 °C. In addition, the peak vRNA levels of the 2016–2017win viruses at 39 °C exhibited a 4-log decrease compared to the RNA levels at 33 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). By contrast, the RNA accumulation and growth rates of the 2017sum viruses were stable at different temperatures (33, 35, 37, and 39 °C) and did not exhibit any significant decrease. These data demonstrated that replication of the 2016–2017win viruses was significantly restricted in MDCK cells at 39 °C, indicating that the 2016–2017win virus strains were temperature sensitive.
