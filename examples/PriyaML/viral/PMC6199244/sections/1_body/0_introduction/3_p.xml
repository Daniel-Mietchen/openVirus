<p id="Par4">The aim of this study was to compare the complete genome sequences of two sequential influenza epidemic viruses and to investigate whether the genetic differences in the two epidemic viruses were correlated with temperature sensitivity and viral replication. The results presented here suggest that the mutation in PA I668V may confer temperature sensitivity and attenuate the polymerase activity of the influenza virus, changing the seasonality and adaptation of the virus.</p>
