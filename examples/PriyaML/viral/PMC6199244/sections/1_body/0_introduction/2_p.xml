<p id="Par3">Between 2014 and 2016, only sporadic influenza infections were reported during summer in Shanghai. However, in 2017, the number of infections increased substantially between May and September among inpatients at Ruijin Hospital. To further examine the influenza epidemics during the summer of 2017 in Shanghai, we compared virus samples obtained during the 2016–2017 winter season in Shanghai with virus samples obtained during the summer season. An etiological and viral replication analysis was performed to investigate the effects of the mutations in the internal gene segments of the influenza A virus during 2017. The influenza A virus contains eight gene segments, namely, basic polymerase 2 (PB2), basic polymerase 1 (PB1), acidic polymerase (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), and nonstructural protein (NS). Antigenic drift in the surface glycoproteins (e.g., HA and NA) can facilitate viral evasion of the host’s immune system
