<p id="Par21">All samples were identified and subtyped by performing real-time RT-PCR. Eight complete gene segments of 47 samples from 62 influenza-infected inpatients were amplified successfully. For the other 15 samples, we analyzed only partial viral genomes because of the low levels of vRNA. In total, 448 gene segments were included in our genome-wide analysis, including the 47 PB2, 50 PB1, 49 PA, 62 HA, 59 NP, 57 NA, 62 M, and 62 NS segments. Among these 62 samples, 28 were obtained from inpatients between Nov. 2016 and Mar. 2017 (2016–2017win 1–28) and 34 were obtained from inpatients between May 2017 and Sep. 2017 (2017sum 1–34). All segments were submitted to the Influenza Research Database under GenBank accession numbers MG984093 to MG984541.</p>
