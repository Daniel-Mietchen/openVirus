<p id="Par26">MDCK cells were infected with the 2014 H3N2, 2016–2017win, and 2017sum viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02 at 33 , 35, 37 or 39 °C. After 1 h of virus adsorption at room temperature, the cells were washed twice with PBS and overlaid with DMEM containing 0.3% BSA, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 2 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin
