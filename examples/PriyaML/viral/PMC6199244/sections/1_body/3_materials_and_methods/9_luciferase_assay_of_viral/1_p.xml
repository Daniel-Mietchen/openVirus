<p id="Par29">Monolayers of 293T cells were transfected with 125 ng of the luciferase reporter plasmid pPolI-NP-luc and 12.5 ng of the internal control plasmid pRL-CMV (Promega, Wisconsin, USA) with a mix of PB2-, PB1-, PA-, and NP-containing plasmids at quantities of 125, 125, 125, and 250 ng, respectively. The transfected 293T cells were incubated at 33, 37, and 39 °C and lysed 24 h post transfection. The luciferase activity was analyzed with a dual-luciferase assay system (Promega, Wisconsin, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The results were the averages from three independent experiments.</p>
