<p>Several semi-captive/free-ranging wild avian species have been noted playing a vital role in the dissemination of viruses, which is an important consideration to control the disease outbreaks. In this series, Newcastle disease (ND), caused by Avian Paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1), is a notifiable disease throughout the world due to the economic impact on trading restrictions and its embargoes placed in endemic regions. The article by Rahman 
 <italic>et al</italic>. highlights the adaptation of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) in feral birds and their potential role in interspecies transmission. The review details the pertinent features of several historical and contemporary aspects of NDV and the vital role of feral birds in its molecular epidemiology and ecology. Reports are very less on the existence of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) in pigs. The North Eastern (NE) part of India is having the maximum pig population in India and the article by Chakraborty 
 <italic>et al</italic>. emphasized on the BVDV in pigs from this region of India with genetic profiling of virus strains.
