<p>Natural Killer (NK) cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells migrate to the site of infection and exhibit antiviral activity. NK cells have cytotoxic activity on cells infected with influenza virus, macrophages phagocytose infected cells and regulate adaptive immune responses, and dendritic cells present viral antigens bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules to na√Øve and memory T lymphocytes, initiating the specific adaptive immune response. In addition, immunoglobulins (mainly IgA) present in nasal secretions contribute to the anti-influenza immune response by preventing viral entry (
