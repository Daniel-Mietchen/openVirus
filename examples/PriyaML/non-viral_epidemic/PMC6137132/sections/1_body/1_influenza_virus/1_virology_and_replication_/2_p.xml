<p>Hemagglutinin is comprised of a dimer HA1-HA2: HA1 is crucial for binding to the host cell receptor whereas HA2 for cell fusion. Viral endocytosis is followed by uncoating and release of viral RNA, which is imported into the nucleus where viral replication and protein synthesis take place using viral polymerase proteins and the host cell machinery (

Neuraminidase allows the virus to leave the infected cell as it cleaves sialic acid (SA) from the cell surface receptors. Viral replication causes cell death with various mechanisms including disruption of protein synthesis and apoptosis. Since viral release continues for hours before cell death, many respiratory epithelial cells are affected and die within a few replication cycles (
