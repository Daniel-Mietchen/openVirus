<p>Transmission of viruses in new hosts implies three different genetic bottleneck phenomena: (i) The viral transmission bottleneck, which determines how much of the viral diversity generated in one host passes to another during transmission (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Studies show that along with major variants, other minor viral variants can be transferred from one host to another (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). These minor variants can be transformed to major through natural selection pressures. Two different processes are related with this bottleneck: virus entry and virus replication followed by production of new virions (ii) Individuals or sub-populations (e.g., humans) migrate in other geographic regions and transfer there only a group of viruses of the initial pool of viruses, and (iii) Genetic bottlenecks of the hosts, e.g., humans. Host genome is vital for the effectiveness of the immune response. Only a subset of the paternal population MHC genes' variability will be transferred in the new geographic region.
