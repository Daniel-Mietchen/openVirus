<p>In population genetics, genetic bottleneck is the event where a sub-group of individuals originating from a larger population, migrate in another geographic region, carrying only a subset of the genetic information of the initial population. This is a standard procedure during evolution. Populations split, and a part of the initial genetic diversity is transferred in different geographic regions. Isolation and new mutations can dramatically change the genetic diversity of the new population.</p>
