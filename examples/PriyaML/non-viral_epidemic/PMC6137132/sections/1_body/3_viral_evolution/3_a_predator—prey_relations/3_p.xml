<p>T4 cells (CD4 cells or T-helper cells) and T8 cells (CD8 cells or T-cytotoxic cells) are the most important lymphocytes that use MHC proteins for recognizing the virus-infected cells. Studies showed that the long-term evolution of T8 cells epitopes may have shaped the long-term evolution of influenza A virus (

On the other hand, influenza viruses seem to respond to this evolutionary pressure by mutations to their nucleoprotein gene (nucleoprotein is an important viral capsid protein for T-cell recognition). It has also been proven that some combinations of MHC proteins and nucleoprotein variants result in immunological response and some not (

In the same regard, TLRs may have remained evolutionary stable, possibly due to the fact that the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) they recognize have also remained unaltered, since they are fundamental for pathogen survival (
