<p>Zika virus has become a major public health concern, with outbreaks of the disease spreading across the globe and resulting in congenital birth defects in some instances. Evolutionary and purifying selection pressures might have facilitated modifications of the ZIKV genome that enhance its replication efficiency and reduce host immune efficiency as it adapted to new hosts in urban environments. This has led to virus strains being categorized as either pre-epidemic or epidemic, with the latter being associated with recent infection outbreaks. Thus far, the S139N amino acid substitution of prM protein has been linked to increased neurovirulence, suggesting that alterations of ZIKV prM protein may enhance viral virulence. Further studies on other observed amino acid substitutions in all viral proteins should be carried out to establish their roles in viral replication efficiency.</p>
