# Contributing

At present all contributions to the project are made on a voluntary basis. 
We respect and value these as donations, not expectations.

## philosophy

We are working out formal contribution mechanisms. The philosophy is:

* all contributors should be recognised
* all artefacts should be Openly licensed (e.g. consistent with the Open Definition https://opendefinition.org . 
In essence: "free to use, free to reuse and free to redistribute for any field of endeavour"
* all contributors should adhere to a Code of Conduct - we intend to implement https://www.contributor-covenant.org/ 
or similar.

## Licenses
The Open Definition covers many types of artefact; our main ones are:
* computer code. Typical licences are Apache V2.0, (L)GPL
* documents. In many cases CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC0 are appropriate
