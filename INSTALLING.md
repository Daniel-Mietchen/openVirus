# Installation and use

Initially we use the command line and well-known systems (Java, R, Text-editing). 

## AMI
The AMI system is a set of about 20 linked command-line tools for creating an AMI "CProject" - a set of directories with defined  names
and functions. For a tutorial see https://github.com/petermr/tigr2ess/tree/master/installation (which might be slightly out of date; 
if so please copy here and amend).

Ideally you should be able to checkout and compile Java under Maven. This creates a single deployable jar file with a series of scripts
to run under unix/macosx or Windows.
