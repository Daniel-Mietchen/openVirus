Retail masks may be certified to local or international standards, but their real-life performance may not confer the exposure reduction potential that is marketed. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of face masks that are commercially available in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Nine masks claiming protection against fine PM (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) were purchased from consumer outlets in Beijing. The masks&#x02019; filtration efficiency was tested by drawing airborne diesel exhaust through a section of the material and measuring the PM<sub>2.5</sub> and black carbon (BC) concentrations upstream and downstream of the filtering medium. Four masks were selected for testing on volunteers. Volunteers were exposed to diesel exhaust inside an experimental chamber while performing sedentary tasks and active tasks. BC concentrations were continuously monitored inside and outside the mask.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean per cent penetration for each mask material ranged from 0.26% to 29%, depending on the flow rate and mask material. In the volunteer tests, the average total inward leakage (TIL) of BC ranged from 3% to 68% in the sedentary tests and from 7% to 66% in the active tests. Only one mask type tested showed an average TIL of less than 10%, under both test conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Many commercially available face masks may not provide adequate protection, primarily due to poor facial fit. Our results indicate that further attention should be given to mask design and providing evidence-based guidance to consumers.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>exposure assessment</kwd><kwd>ppe</kwd><kwd>air pollution</kwd><kwd>diesel fumes</kwd><kwd>pm10-pm2.5-ultrafine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>Natural Environment Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><sec><title>What is already known about this subject?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Both the filtration efficiency and edge-seal leakage of a face&#x000a0;mask or respirator are important in determining the exposure reduction a mask will confer on the wearer.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mask wearing is associated with positive impacts such as short-term reductions in blood pressure and increases in heart rate variability, but the exposure reduction associated with these impacts is not known.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What are the new findings?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Filtration efficiency of a face&#x000a0;mask does not necessarily translate into consistent exposure reduction for individuals.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Some masks marketed as highly efficient at reducing particulate exposure do not achieve the claimed exposure reduction when worn by individuals.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Even the best performing masks did not always reduce exposure consistently across a range of activities.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>How might this impact on policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable future?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study indicates that rigorous and standardised testing, including volunteer trials, should be conducted to ensure the efficacy of all face&#x000a0;masks available for consumer use against air pollution.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Furthermore, consumers and regulators should be better informed about the exposure impacts of different mask types and how to ensure that masks fits appropriately.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Researchers interested in investigating the health impacts of face&#x000a0;masks should include measurements of exposure reduction on study participants to more accurately evaluate the impact of mask wearing on air pollution exposure.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>In China, air pollution causes around 1.6&#x02009;million premature deaths each year and the loss of around 31&#x02009;million disability-adjusted life years.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Annual average particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter 2.5 micrometres (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)&#x000a0;concentrations in Chinese megacities well exceed the WHO&#x02019;s guideline of 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/m<sup>3</sup>, and corresponding black carbon (BC) concentrations are around 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/m<sup>3</sup>.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Beijing PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations often reach unhealthy levels during the winter and near busy streets.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Chinese residents now have access to air quality information and can take measures to protect themselves in the short term.

In this manuscript, we use the latter term (or abbreviate to &#x02018;mask&#x02019;), as we are evaluating these devices for use in non-occupational air pollution settings. Respirators remove particles from the inhaled airstream by filtration, through gravitational settling, inertial impaction, interception, diffusion and electrostatic deposition.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Filtration efficiency depends on particle size, charge, concentration and flow rate through the filter material. In practice, the contaminant may bypass the filter, by passing through small gaps between the edge of the respirator and the face, so-called &#x02018;edge-seal leakage&#x02019;. The extent of leakage depends on factors such as the size and shape of the face, facial hair, the respirator design and the way that it is worn.</p><p>Disposable particulate respirators sold for use in workplaces are generally tested to ensure compliance with appropriate international or national standards (online&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table S1</xref>), but face&#x000a0;masks sold for public protection against air pollution may not need to comply with any standards, and so may not be suitable. In November 2016, the Chinese National Institute of Standardization issued a new guideline to recommend testing of protection levels for &#x02018;daily protective masks&#x02019; (online&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table S1</xref>). This guideline (GB/T 32&#x02009;610&#x02013;2016) categorises masks based on their filtration efficiency (online&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table S1</xref>). Unlike GB2626-2006 (the Chinese standard for occupational masks) and other regulatory standards, it is not compulsory that &#x02018;daily protective masks&#x02019; fulfil these testing guidelines.

Masks mounted on mannequins provide only partially&#x000a0;realistic tests. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the filtration efficiency of a range of masks sold to consumers in Beijing and, for the best performing masks, to assess mask effectiveness in reducing exposure to diesel exhaust particulates when worn by volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Nine masks were purchased in China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>,&#x000a0;online&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table S2</xref>), online, in a local pharmacy or convenience store.

The Durbin-Watson statistic was 0.12 from a simple regression model with mask type as the dependent variable, indicating positive autocorrelation. The transformed value produced in a Cochrane-Orcutt regression was close to 2.00 (1.85), suggesting autocorrelation had been sufficiently addressed. Only mask type and activity were significant in the model at P&#x0003c;0.05. Face size, sitting/standing and elapsed time had no measureable effect on TIL. A log-linear model was deemed a better fit than a linear model according to the Bayesian information criterion difference. After adjustment for covariates, the 3M9322 mask was significantly better than the three other masks, which increased leakage by a factor of 2.0 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.3) to 26.7 (95% CI 16.4 to 43.5) (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Compared with talking, only bending and head moving contributed to higher TIL, ranging from 1.1 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.3) to 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.3) times greater than the reference category of talking, respectively.

We demonstrate that a mask with highly&#x000a0;efficient particle filtering material may confer little protection when worn. Facial fit and movement have a large impact on the actual protection. In spite of the generally&#x000a0;good filtration efficiency of the tested mask materials, two of the masks performed poorly when worn because of inadequate fit to the face. These included a reusable mask with disposable filters (Yi Jie PM2.5) and a single-fold disposable mask (Yimeijian). The reusable mask cloth was loose, and the filters did not cover the whole surface area of the mask. These masks used elasticated ear loops to hold them onto the face rather than head straps. Even for the better-performing masks (3M9502 and 3M9322), some volunteers&#x02019; results indicated that the fit was not sufficient to ensure maximal performance of the mask.</p><p>Our first-order autoregression model suggested the presence of large differences in the efficacy of the tested masks, and that activities, namely, bending and head moving, adversely affected the fit. The best performing mask had an estimated mean leakage of 2.3%, which corresponds to a protection factor of 43 (protection factor being the inverse of the leakage, or TIL). The poorest performing mask had a mean leakage of 61% (protection factor 1.6). The face size of the volunteer or the duration did not have a detectable effect on leakage; however, the tests were conducted over a short time, and we cannot be certain of the effect of longer duration wear.</p><p>Our results correspond with findings from van der Sande <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> who tested an FFP2 mask (online&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table S1</xref>) versus a surgical mask and a home-made tea cloth mask against sodium chloride (NaCl) particles&#x000a0;&#x0003c;1&#x02009;&#x000b5;m diameter on volunteers. They found differences between protection factors for volunteers within a single mask type, with children much less protected compared with adults. Variation of protection by activity was greatest for an FFP2 mask compared with surgical and home-made tea cloth masks, implying that, although the FFP2 mask conferred greatest protection in terms of its material composition, fit was an important factor. A study of respiratory protection against volcanic ash also found that industry-certified N95 or N99 equivalent masks performed best in volunteer TIL tests compared with masks made from other materials with similar filtering abilities.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Similarly, Grinshpun <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> found that 70% of total variability in the faceseal-leakage-to-filter&#x000a0;(FLTF) ratio was associated with subject characteristics, compared with 30% due to how the subject put on the respirator. They also found that movement exercises resulted in larger FLTF ratios and that the ratio increased as particle size increased (from 0.04 to 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;m). Conversely, Lee <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> did not find a particle-dependent protection relationship in a similar size range, and Shakya <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> found variable results with regard to filtration efficiency and particle size (all below 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;m). These size-dependent effects may be due to submicron-sized particles being more likely to deposit by diffusion. Diesel exhaust particulate primarily consists of the ultrafine fraction of the aerosol, which can be breathed deep into the alveolar region of the lung and may then cross into the bloodstream.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The use of a diesel exhaust challenge, rather than sodium chloride, provides a scenario that is closer to real-world exposures, particularly near busy roads, where people are more likely to wear masks. Gao <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> found that N95 filters did not perform as well compared with R95 or P95 filters when exposed to combustion source aerosol (wood, paper&#x000a0;and plastic) compared with NaCl, although all these filters did filter at least 95% of the aerosol.</p><p>None of the masks tested in our study were certified to the Chinese guidelines for &#x02018;daily protective masks&#x02019; (GB/T 32&#x02009;610&#x02013;2016), because the guidelines were introduced after our study was conducted, but six of the nine masks we tested were reportedly certified to GB2626-2006, or an international equivalent. One of these (Yi Jie) performed poorly in the volunteer trial. While respirators for workplace use are required to be tested to a rigorous standard, including TIL, respirators for the consumer market are not.</p><p>An analysis of internet purchases of face&#x000a0;masks in urban areas across China found that a 100-point increase in the Air Quality Index resulted in a 70% increase in sales of masks marketed as &#x02018;anti-PM<sub>2.5</sub>&#x02019; and a 54% increase in all mask purchases,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> indicating that this is a popular method of protection used by people in China. To ensure that the general public are able to effectively protect themselves, all consumer air pollution masks should be required to fulfil the same standards as workplace masks, and sales of non-compliant models should be restricted. Consumers in China also need better information about the type of masks that should be used,&#x000a0;the actual TIL that might be achieved with face&#x000a0;masks and how to wear the masks to achieve a good fit. Consumers should know that, although surgical masks may have reasonable filtration efficiency, the design generally confers poor facial fit and high TIL&#x000a0;with regards to air pollution.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 29 30</xref></p><p>In addition to consumer applications, our study has implications for research studies that investigate health benefits of mask-wearing to protect against air pollution. While studies have shown some reduction in blood pressure and increases in heart&#x000a0;rate variability from wearing a respirator over a few hours, there was no assessment of the exposure reduction while the respirators were being worn in any of these studies.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> Our study has shown that there may be considerable interindividual and intraindividual variation in TIL, even with relatively well-constructed respirators, and there are potentially&#x000a0;large, systematic differences among respirator brands.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study was not a comprehensive survey of air pollution face&#x000a0;masks, but rather, provides preliminary results. We selected a convenience sample of masks from retail outlets based on accessibility and design type. There are a wide variety of masks on the market, and we were not able to test all of them. We also had a relatively small sample size of volunteers, and not all volunteers wore all four masks that were being tested; therefore, we cannot draw conclusions about the fit across all tested masks for a given face shape. We had more small/medium face types than large and did not have sufficient volunteers to distinguish small from medium. We had similar numbers of males and females but, due to small numbers, this was not a representative sample, nor were the subjects exclusively Chinese.</p><p>Another potential uncertainty in our study relates to the response of the instruments to the aerosol concentration. If the response is not linear across the range of concentrations, we may be underestimating or overestimating the filtration efficiency. We have previously evaluated the MicroAeth AE51 in the field versus a reference aethelometer (AE22) and found a consistently linear relationship across the range of concentrations tested in this study (unpublished data). Although we do not have a reference comparison for the Sidepak for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, the relationship between the penetration ratios for each instrument is linear, implying that the Sidepak should have a similar response across the range of concentrations in the study.</p><p>In future work, we suggest that a comprehensive survey of the different face&#x000a0;mask types available and of their popularity of use be conducted. A larger, more representative population sample should be recruited for testing, and a wider variety of face&#x000a0;mask types should be tested for TIL. In day-to-day use, respirators will not be constantly worn, and this will inevitably reduce the overall protection offered although, to our knowledge, there are no extensive study data available on wearing behaviour of consumers in China. To assess the exposure-reduction potential of real-world face&#x000a0;mask use in the public, it is necessary to understand wearing patterns and to assess the effect of constant donning and doffing of masks by the general public. In future studies of the public health benefits of wearing respiratory protection, we recommend the researchers monitor particulate concentrations inside the facepiece and take these data into account in analysis of the association between exposure to particulate pollution and health markers. This would provide a more&#x000a0;accurate assessment of particulate exposure change and more robustness to the evaluation of the exposure&#x02013;response relationship.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Thomas Winski for his advice in planning and designing the project.
