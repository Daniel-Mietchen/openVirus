The cloth masks (CM) are usually double layered with stretchable ear loops. It is common practice to use such masks for months after multiple washing and drying cycles. If a CM is used for long time, the ear loops become stretched. The loop needs to be knotted to make the mask loop fit better on the face. It is not clear how washing and drying and stretching practices change the quality of a CM. The particulate matter (PM) filtering efficiency of a mask depends on multiple parameters, such as pore size, shape, clearance, and pore number density. It is important to understand the effect of these parameters on the filtering efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We characterized the surface of twenty different types of CMs using optical image analysis method. The filtering efficiency of selected cloth face masks was measured using the particle counting method. We also studied the effects of washing and drying and stretching on the quality of a mask.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The pore size of masks ranged from 80 to 500 &#x003bc;m, which was much bigger than particular matter having diameter of 2.5 &#x003bc;m or less (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and 10 &#x003bc;m or less (PM<sub>10</sub>) size. The PM<sub>10</sub> filtering efficiency of four of the selected masks ranged from 63% to 84%. The poor filtering efficiency may have arisen from larger and open pores present in the masks. Interestingly, we found that efficiency dropped by 20% after the 4th washing and drying cycle. We observed a change in pore size and shape and a decrease in microfibers within the pores after washing. Stretching of CM surface also altered the pore size and potentially decreased the filtering efficiency. As compared to CMs, the less frequently used surgical/paper masks had complicated networks of fibers and much smaller pores in multiple layers in comparison to CMs, and therefore had better filtering efficiency. This study showed that the filtering efficiency of cloth face masks were relatively lower, and washing and drying practices deteriorated the efficiency. We believe that the findings of this study will be very helpful for increasing public awareness and help governmental agencies to make proper guidelines and policies for use of face mask.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Face mask</kwd><kwd>Particulate matter</kwd><kwd>Filtering efficiency</kwd><kwd>Pore morphology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>Kathmandu Institute of Applied Sciences</funding-source><award-id>KIAS2016-1</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by startup funding to Basant Giri from&#x02014;Kathmandu Institute of Applied Sciences (No.KIAS2016-1).

Microscopic particles having a diameter of 2.5 &#x003bc;m or less (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) can become deposited in the conducting zone of the respiratory system including the alveoli, and penetrate to the cardiovascular system. These fine particles are believed to be responsible for various health problems such as lung inflammation and lung cancer, vascular dysfunction, myocardial infarction, and exacerbation of existing conditions like asthma, diabetes mellitus (<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Reche et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Kim, Kabir &#x00026; Kabir, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that ambient air pollution caused around 4.2 million deaths in 2016, with Asia alone contributing around 60% of total global burden (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The PM pollution in many cities globally is higher than the WHO recommended safe limit (<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Colbeck, Nasir &#x00026; Ali, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Maleki et al., 2016</xref>). For example, in Kathmandu Valley, one of the most densely populated and the fastest-growing cities in Asia, air quality is very poor, with PM alone contributing to around 50&#x02013;60% of total pollution burden. The ambient annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration levels in core urban areas of Kathmandu, Nepal has been reported to be around 54 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, which is significantly higher than the WHO standard of 10 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">IQ Air, 2018</xref>). In recent years, a systematic study on exposure of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (finer fractions of PM<sub>10</sub>) to subjects of different occupations was made in few core and sub-urban areas of Kathmandu Valley. The hourly personal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure to traffic police who spend 8&#x02013;12 h on road duty was found in the range of 40&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Gurung &#x00026; Bell, 2012</xref>), which is 1.6&#x02013;3.2 times higher than WHO standard for 24 h average of 25 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The PM pollution can be minimized by putting forwarding both short- and long-term policies and regulations and enforcing them. Efforts have been made, but their impact in minimizing pollution is almost futile in the cities of developing countries.</p><p>Studies have shown that face masks reduce the exposure to PM and other contaminants (<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Chughtai, Seale &#x00026; MacIntyre, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">MacIntyre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Shakya et al., 2017</xref>). The most commonly used face masks are cloth masks (CMs) and surgical masks (SMs). The effectiveness of a mask is measured by its filtering efficiency. A mask is considered effective if its filtering efficiency is greater than 95%. The efficacy of a mask depends on type of mask material (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2018</xref>), particle size and charge of aerosol tested (<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Shakya et al., 2017</xref>), and user preference (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Maxted, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Chughtai, Seale &#x00026; MacIntyre, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The CMs are particularly popular in developing countries because they are inexpensive (unit retail price range: USD 0.08&#x02013;1.5), locally available, and reusable after washing. The CMs are usually double layered (two ply masks) with stretchable ear loops (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Figs. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">1B</xref>). The face masks have also been widely used in healthcare facilities to minimize contamination (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Chughtai, Seale &#x00026; MacIntyre, 2013</xref>), in emergency situations such as volcanic eruptions (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2018</xref>) and in occupational hazard protection (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Belkin, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Van Der Sande, Teunis &#x00026; Sabel, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">MacIntyre &#x00026; Chughtai, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Cherrie et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig-1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.7142/fig-1</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Types of mask and survey.</title><p>(A) Images of some of the most commonly used cloth masks, and less commonly used surgical mask (B).

As the ambient aerosol we are exposed to is a mixture of particles of varying size and shape in ambient environmental condition, use of simulated particles in controlled laboratory setting may not truly represent the filtering efficiency of masks.</p><p>The most commonly used face masks in low-income countries are CMs. Such masks are used for many days and are also used after washing and drying multiple times. In addition, the one-for-all type ear loop of mask does not fit everyone. Therefore, the loop has to be knotted or stretched for better fitting on the face. The washing, drying and stretching practices may change the pore size and porosity of the fabric and thus may deteriorate filtering efficiency. There are no published reports on the surface morphology of face masks and the effect of washing and stretching on pore size of the masks.</p><p>In this work, we report on the detail study on surface characterization (pore size, shape, clearance, and pore distribution) of commonly available cloth face masks purchased from local market of Kathmandu, Nepal, and compared with surgical face masks using bright field microscope. We then measured the efficacy of masks on filtering ambient outdoor aerosol particles by particle counting method. Finally, we report on the effect of washing and drying cycles and stretching on surface characteristics and filtering efficiency of CMs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Survey study</title><p>We began our study by conducting a survey to know the type of masks people use in Kathmandu. We counted 1,500 people walking through the junction road in Kalanki, Kathmandu and noted number of people wearing face mask and type of mask. The visual counting was carried out from 9.00 am to 1.00 pm for 3 consecutive days in the month of May 2016. Kalanki is a major traffic intersection in Kathmandu.</p></sec><sec><title>Surface characterization of masks</title><p>A total of 20 different types of cloth face masks (CM) and seven different brands of SMs were purchased from local markets in Kathmandu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Figs. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">1B</xref>). The CM types were selected on the basis of design and fabric material. A small section of each mask was cut and was imaged using an optical microscope in bright field mode using objective of 0.4 NA (10&#x000d7;, air) with total magnification of 100&#x000d7;. A built in white LED was used as illumination source and image was acquired by a CMOS camera (AmScope, Irvine, CA, USA). For each mask 10 images were taken and the collected images were processed in ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The field of view of measured image was calibrated by using a calibration glass slide having grid size of 10 &#x003bc;m (AmScope, Irvine, CA, USA). The intensity of light used before the lens was around one mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Acquisition time of image, unless specified, was set to 500 m.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of filtering efficiency</title><p>Microscope coverslips (Corning, 1.5, 22 &#x000d7; 22 mm) were placed on a polystyrene petri dish (Microteknic, Haryana, India, 80 mm diameter and 13 mm depth) and the petri dish was covered with a face mask. To make sure coverslip surface is free from particles, the surface was cleaned and inspected by the bright field microscope. To ensure no marginal leakage of particles, the mask was fastened to the petri dish with a rubber band. The whole assembly was kept at 20 feet above the ground in an open box in central Kathmandu. Major sources of PM pollution in this area are vehicular exhausts, dust suspensions, and particles from poorly maintained roads. For control measurement, a second assembly was made without mask and kept in the same place. Both assemblies were exposed to PM for 30 min and number of particles deposited on the glass coverslip surface was counted after the surface was imaged at magnification of 100&#x000d7; with a bright field microscope.</p><p>One mask type was sampled at a time and triplicate measurements were carried out for each mask. All experiments were made in sunny days during 11.00 am to 1.00 pm time period. Although we did not measure the wind velocity at our site, the wind velocity was low (&#x0223c;10 km/h) at Tribhuvan International Airport, which is just two km aerial distance away.</p><p>The filtering efficiency was calculated as:<disp-formula id="eqn-1"><label>(1)</label><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="peerj-07-7142-e001.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Although the features in the middle layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2H</xref>) are not distinctly discernible due to the limited resolution of the microscopic set up used in this study, we can tell that this layer has mocro/nanoporous membrane-like structures. The presence of three layers, with the middle layer having very small pores, shows that the medical mask may be efficient in blocking the PM.</p><p>We also explored if there is any difference on the interior surface of CMs and SM.

In this regard, actual size of particles measured can have some uncertainty. Nonetheless, classification of particles in three categories viz. &#x0003c;5, 5&#x02013;10, and &#x0003e;10 &#x003bc;m was possible in our case. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3B</xref>, a total of 98% particles were smaller than 10 &#x003bc;m, which is in consistent with a recent study reported by our group (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Rauniyaar, Aryal &#x00026; Neupane, 2019</xref>). Thus, the filtering efficiency of the face mask reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3A</xref> can be considered as PM<sub>10</sub> filtering efficiency.</p><p>Bright filed microscopy is frequently used in the determination of number density of micro-meter sized objects (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Ricardo &#x00026; Phelan, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Drey, Graber &#x00026; Bieschke, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Rauniyaar, Aryal &#x00026; Neupane, 2019</xref>). The accuracy in such measurement is high if: (1) light scattering efficiency of an object to be imaged is high so they can be contrasted from the background, and (2) individual dispersion in the field of view can be achieved. In our case, scattering efficiency of particles is higher than background, and we maintained number of particles per field of view low so that number density can be determined.</p><p>The filtering efficiency reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3A</xref> was negatively correlated with pore size of the masks, (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.94) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7">Fig. 7</xref>). The poor efficiency of CM9 (&#x0223c;63%) is due to the presence of larger and open pores (pores size 461 &#x000b1; 113 &#x003bc;m) and improved efficiency of CM7 (&#x0223c;84%) is due to presence of smaller pores (pores size 100 &#x000b1; 53 &#x003bc;m). It is interesting to note that filtering efficiency of CM9 is still &#x0003e;60% although the pores are much bigger than the reported particle size. This contradiction may be due to low pore density of the masks and mismatch of the pores in two layers during use. The filtering efficiency of SM was 94%. Again, the excellent filtering efficiency can be attributed to the presence of nicely interwoven microfibers with small pores (in middle layer) as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Figs. 2G</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">2I</xref>. The difference in morphology of surgical and CMs is more obvious in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Supplemental Information 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">2</xref> that show axial scanning of a CM and a SM, respectively.</p><fig id="fig-7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.7142/fig-7</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Correlation between pore size and filtering efficiency.</title><p>Each data point represents the mean pore size of mask (in &#x003bc;m) plotted as a function of filtering efficiency.

Our method is passive sampling method as it measures the filtering efficiency of free falling dust particles without considering active suction to mimic human inhalation and exhalation. Efficiency was determined by the passive transfer of the particles from one side of the mask to the other. Therefore, this method provides the upper estimate of filtering efficiency or best-case-estimate of capture efficiency of mask. Although our method did not mimic the breathing condition, it allowed us to measure the filtering efficiency using ambient PM. If a standard mask (N95 or 99) is available, our method could be a cheaper alternative to screen the relative efficiency of a mask of unknown efficiency and compare with a standard mask such as N95 or N99.</p><p>Filtering efficiency of CM has also been reported in other studies by using active sampling method (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Rengasamy, Eimer &#x00026; Shaffer, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Shakya et al., 2017</xref>). They have reported that filtering efficiency of a CM depends on the nature of particles (size and charge) used to measure the filtering efficiency, nature, and design of mask. Their reported efficiency is in the range of 10&#x02013;90% and conclude that CM perform poorer than N95 SM. In contrast, we used passive method and ambient PM. The surface characteristics of masks could also be different. Therefore, efficiency values are difficult to compare. Nonetheless, our conclusion is same; that is, CM perform poorer than SMs.</p></sec><sec><title>Stretching effect on mask surface</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Figure 4</xref> shows that mask (CM7) surface changed on stretching with significant increase in pore size in stretched mask. This observation is very important. People use CM for months and the ear loops get stretched. The loop has to be knotted to make the mask fit better on the face. If mask having knotted ear-loop is used, it is very likely that the whole mask surface gets stretched. Although we did not measure the filtering efficiency while the mask was stretched, it can be easily inferred that efficiency will decline if a mask with a knotted ear-loop is used due to changes in pore morphology as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of washing and drying</title><p>The filtering efficiency measured after each washing and drying cycle for up to four cycles is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>. We found a gradual decrease in filtering efficiency with an increase in washing and drying cycle. As compared to an unwashed mask of efficiency &#x0223c;63%, after the 4th washing and drying cycle there was &#x0223c;20% drop in filtering efficiency.</p><p>A close observation of images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6</xref> shows that small changes in surface morphology occur after each cycle. The first change is increase in pore size and change in pore shape. The second change is decrease in number of microfibers within the pore so that pore look more open that is, increase in pore clearance. These changes on the mask should be responsible for decline in efficiency after washing and drying cycle, in consistent with the data reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We studied the effect of surface morphology of locally available face masks on their PM filtering efficiency. Filtering efficiency of CM for ambient PM<sub>10</sub> was poorer than in SM. The poor efficiency was due to the presence of larger sized pores. Our study also demonstrated that washing and drying cycle deteriorates the filtering efficiency due to change in pore shape and clearance. We also found that stretching of the CM surface alters the pore size and potentially decreases the filtering efficiency. The findings of this study suggest that CM are not effective, and that effectiveness deteriorates if used after washing and drying cycles and if used under stretched condition. We believe that the findings of this study will be helpful for increasing public awareness among populations of developing countries where such masks are very common, and for policy makers to make and implement basic guidelines for face masks for public use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplemental-information"><title>Supplemental Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.7142/supp-1</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 1</label><caption><title>Axial scanning of a cloth mask.</title><p>A short video that shows scanning of a cloth mask (CM9) at various axial positions.</p></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-07-7142-s001.wmv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.7142/supp-2</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 2</label><caption><title>Axial scanning for a surgical mask.</title><p>A short video that shows scanning of surgical mask (SM) at various axial positions.</p></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-07-7142-s002.wmv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.7142/supp-3</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 3</label><caption><title>Raw data: survey, filtering efficiency, particle size, and pore size data.</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-07-7142-s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional Information and Declarations</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interests"><title>Competing Interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conflict-1"><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contributions"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-1"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-1">Bhanu Bhakta Neupane</xref> conceived and designed the experiments, analyzed the data, contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, approved the final draft.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-2"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-2">Sangita Mainali</xref> conceived and designed the experiments, performed the experiments.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-3"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-3">Amita Sharma</xref> performed the experiments, prepared figures and/or tables.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="contribution-4"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-4">Basant Giri</xref> analyzed the data, contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, approved the final draft.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Data Availability</title><fn id="addinfo-1"><p>The following information was supplied regarding data availability:</p><p>The axial scanning of the cloth mask 9 (CM9) surgical mask (SM), and raw measurements are available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplemental-information">Supplemental Files</xref>.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><ref-list content-type="authoryear"><title>References</title><ref id="ref-1"><label>Belkin (1997)</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Belkin</surname><given-names>NL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The evolution of the surgical mask: filtering efficiency versus effectiveness</article-title><source>Infection Control &#x00026; Hospital Epidemiology</source><year>1997</year><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>49</fpage><lpage>57</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1086/647501</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9013247</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref-2"><label>Cherrie et al.
