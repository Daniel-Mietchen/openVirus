    "BACKGROUND:Air pollutants cause endocrine disorders and hormone disruption. The relationship between air pollutants and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) must be carefully investigated using a nationwide cohort. METHODS:Data were extracted from two nationwide databases, namely Longitudinal Health Insurance Database and Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Database, and analyzed. The study considered a range of data that began on 1 January 2000 and ended on 31 December 2013. Women diagnosed with PCOS were excluded. From the residential data, the study assessed the daily concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and PM2.5 the women were exposed to. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was applied to assess PCOS risk. RESULTS:In total, 91,803 women were enrolled in this study; of those women, 2072 developed PCOS after 12 years of follow-up. The mean daily concentrations of SO2, NOx, NO, NO2, and PM2.5 women were exposed to were 4.25 (±1.44) ppb, 20.41 (±6.65) ppb, 9.25 (±4.36) ppb, 20.99 (±3.33) ppb, and 30.85 (±6.16) μg/m3, respectively. Compared with the first-quartile levels of exposure, the fourth-quartile levels of exposure to SO2, NOx, NO, NO2, and PM2.5 increased PCOS risk by 10.31 times (95% CI = 8.35-12.7), 3.37 times (95% CI = 2.86-3.96), 4.18 times (95% CI = 3.57-4.89), 7.46 times (95% CI = 6.38-8.71), and 3.56 times (95% CI = 3.05-4.15), respectively. CONCLUSION:Women exposed to a high concentrations of air pollutants, namely SO2, NO, NO2, NOx, and PM2.5, had a high PCOS risk."
