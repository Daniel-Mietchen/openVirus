  <result pre="a potential route of influenza transmission [ 11]. In general," exact="influenza" post="A can be spread via the airborne, droplet and"/>
  <result pre="droplet and direct and indirect contact routes. Many simulations of" exact="influenza" post="transmission have been conducted in enclosed spaces such as"/>
  <result pre="cities [ 14], and even between cities [ 15]. Large-scale" exact="influenza" post="transmission is usually based on macroscopic factors such as"/>
  <result pre="human behaviour is unknown or randomly set. A simulation of" exact="influenza" post="A transmission based on realistic data of human behaviour"/>
  <result pre="behaviour in a confined space is needed to help understand" exact="influenza" post="A transmission and to implement effective measures to prevent"/>
  <result pre="to prevent and control disease. In this study, we simulated" exact="influenza" post="A transmission in a graduate student office by considering"/>
  <result pre="realistic behaviour obtained from these recorded data. We discovered how" exact="influenza" post="A virus is transmitted via air, hands, surfaces, mucous"/>
  <result pre="also analysed the efficacy of various strategies for prevention of" exact="influenza" post="A via various transmission routes. 2. Materials and Methods"/>
  <result pre="via various transmission routes. 2. Materials and Methods We simulated" exact="influenza" post="A transmission via three routes (long-range airborne, fomite and"/>

  <result pre="is huge. 4. Discussion In this paper, we studied how" exact="influenza" post="A transmits in a graduate student office in one"/>
  <result pre="droplet spray routes. However, in an air cabin, focusing on" exact="influenza" post="A H1N1, the contributions via the airborne, close contact"/>
  <result pre="remains at a lower level because the inactivation rate of" exact="influenza" post="A on the hands is high. The quantity of"/>
  <result pre="1.6 times that of other students. Approximately 4.2% of the" exact="influenza" post="A infection risk comes from fomites. However, for other"/>
  <result pre="limited. These high-risk surfaces should be given more attention in" exact="infectious disease" post="transmission, especially on some diseases that are highly dependent"/>
  <result pre="and surface cleaning [ 60], can limit the spread of" exact="influenza" post="A in a confined room. Wearing a mask can"/>
  <result pre="Mask wearing is much more efficient than hand washing because" exact="influenza" post="A is transmitted mainly via the airborne and close"/>
  <result pre="sealed on the infected student, which is very useful in" exact="influenza" post="A transmission control. The airborne route is the main"/>
  <result pre="transmission control. The airborne route is the main route of" exact="influenza" post="A virus spread. In a norovirus outbreak, the efficiency"/>
  <result pre="is much lower than on the hands. The results of" exact="influenza" post="A simulation based on real data of human behaviour"/>
  <result pre="is very helpful to help understand the real characteristics of" exact="influenza" post="A transmission and to make effective plans to prevent"/>
  <result pre="increase the risk of infectious diseases outbreak including malaria, measles," exact="viral hepatitis," post="etc. [ 62, 63]. After a serious disaster, many"/>
