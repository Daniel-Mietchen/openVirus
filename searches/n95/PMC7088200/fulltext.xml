The aim of this study was to evaluate the attack rate of HCP by the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus during the 2009 pandemic influenza season in Korea. HCP infected with H1N1 virus were asked to fill out a questionnaire, which included job type, method of diagnosis, facility type, history of contact with patients infected by H1N1 virus, vaccination status, and use of personal protective equipment. A total of 328 HCP (female 68.6%, 225/328) were infected with H1N1 virus at the nine study centers. The highest attack rate was in physicians, followed by nurses and nurses&#x02019; aides. Transmission occurred primarily after contact with outpatients (27.8%), followed by contact with inpatients (21.6%). Most (77.3%) of the infected HCP never used an N95 mask during contact with patients. Surgical masks were always used by 29.4% of the subjects and usually or intermittent used by 46.9%. The peak incidence of the H1N1 infection among HCP preceded that among the general population. Among HCPs, physicians, nurses, and nurses&#x02019; aides were at the greatest risk of H1N1 infection. HCP should be more vigilant and protect themselves with appropriate personal protective equipment during the influenza season.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Influenza</kwd><kwd>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</kwd><kwd>H1N1 Virus</kwd><kwd>Attack Rate</kwd><kwd>Influenza Season</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Healthcare personnel (HCP) infected with influenza, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, can transmit influenza to vulnerable patients and other employees in the hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

HCP were defined as employees, contractors, and clinicians whose activities involved contact with patients in healthcare or laboratory settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Infection of HCP with H1N1 virus was confirmed by real-time or multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All of the subjects were interviewed by well-trained nurses or physicians using a same standard protocol. The study subjects of HCP were classified into four groups based on job type: Group I (physicians), Group II (nurses and nurses&#x02019; aides), Group III (technicians, therapists, emergency paramedical service personnel, laboratory personnel, and pharmacists), and Group IV (administrative workers and others employees not directly involved in patient care but having the potential of being exposed to infectious agents, i.e., clerical, dietary, and maintenance workers).</p><p>From 27th October 2009, vaccine for H1N1 virus became available in Korea. All of the participating hospitals completed a vaccination program for HCP by early December 2009. The attack rate of H1N1 virus was calculated by comparing the infected HCP versus entire HCP as the denominator because we did not evaluate the daily vaccination status of HCP. We used pandemic H1N1 infection status in Korea with daily average anti-viral agent consumption because most infected individuals did not undergo confirmatory tests after the Korean health authorities recommended anti-viral agent for all patients with any influenza-like illness on 21st October 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Knowing the incidence of infection for each job type of HCP in the hospital during influenza or other infectious pandemics would provide important information and allow for more effective management and control of influenza dissemination. However, no reports have focused on the incidence of infection according to each type of HCP during influenza seasons. In the present study, the attack rate of HCP was highest in physicians, nurses, and nurses&#x02019; aides. The attack rates in the first three professional groups were similar, while Group IV was significantly lower than the other groups. These groups represent the most likely HCP to be in contact with infected patients. Our findings are similar to those of previous studies assessing the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection of HCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], in which physicians, nurses, and nurses&#x02019; aides were determined to be at the highest risk for infection. Given these findings, physicians, nurses, and nurses&#x02019; aides should wear appropriate protective equipment and should be the first among HCP to be vaccinated.</p><p>A risk of infection in HCP also exists in the outpatient setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many contacts between HCP and infected patients likely occur in ambulatory-care settings during the week preceding symptom onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In our study, infections were the most common in general wards (35.6%), followed by the outpatient department (25.0%), and emergency room (10.4%). Twenty-two percent of HCP reported that they worked in a flu ward, which was the outpatient department.</p><p>Similar to the results of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], most infections in this study occurred in the healthcare setting (outpatients, inpatients, and HCP). This was followed by exposure to infected family members and infection due to unknown origin. In a previous report, 46% of cases were due to contact with patients with either H1N1 infection or an undiagnosed respiratory illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Meanwhile, 23.0% of HCP infections were due to contact with a friend or family member with H1N1 infection or undiagnosed respiratory illness.</p><p>In the healthcare setting, personal protective equipment are used to protect patients from healthcare-associated infections and to protect HCP from occupational exposure through droplet or airborne spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Face masks (N95 or surgical masks) are crucial for the successful management of an outbreak of pandemics, keeping susceptible HCP safe from hospitalized patients and outpatients shedding droplet and airborne influenza particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this study, the usage rate of N95 was very low (77.3% of HCP did not use an N95 mask, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Surgical masks, on the other hand, were used relatively often (29.4% of HCP always used a surgical mask). Gloves were not used 60.6% of the time, and goggles were used only 1.2% of the time. Gowns were not used 68.4% of the time. These results are very similar to those of other studies of behavior in the hospital setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that vaccination efforts should focus initially on healthcare and emergency medical service personnel whose members are at higher risk for influenza or influenza-related complications and those who are likely to come in contact with the influenza virus as a part of their occupation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Persons in all of these groups should be vaccinated as soon as the vaccine is available. The World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts recommended that each country secures a supply of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine sufficient to vaccinate all HCP in order to protect those at greatest risk and to minimize any disruption of healthcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p> In this study, we found that the peak of H1N1 infection in HCP preceded the peak in the general population. The vaccination of HCP was a top priority in Korea, and after vaccination of the high-risk population, the number of patients with H1N1 influenza decreased rapidly. Early vaccination of these groups including HCP may have attributed to the decline of transmission. There were no deaths among the infected HCP surveyed in this study. Most infected HCP were young and were diagnosed soon after symptoms began. We believe that young age, early diagnosis, and rapid treatment were the main reasons for the lack of deaths occurring in this study.</p><p>However, there are several limitations. First, we did not calculate attack rates with full-time equivalent (FTE), which gives a rate controlled for different intensities of exposure to source patients. The proportion of part-time workers in the tertiary hospital is very low (&#x0003c;1.0%) in Korea. Even if we could use FTE in analysis, the attack rates associated with exposure to source patients would be similar to the results reported in this investigation. Second, we compared the HCP infection with all patients receiving anti-viral therapy. Therefore, there is a possibility of an overestimation of influenza patients. However, during the 2009&#x02013;2010 pandemic influenza season in Korea, the total number of the isolated influenza viruses reported by the influenza sentinel surveillance was 3,852 (A/H3N2, 2; A (2009 H1N1), 3,842; B, 8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Among the 3,852 isolates, 99.7% were 2009 H1N1, suggesting that the estimation of influenza patients in this report is slightly over the actual number.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first report indicating that HCP were at the greatest risk and these facts should be taken into consideration when creating a strategy for dealing with future influenza epidemics.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>J.
