Although TB had been recognized since ancient times, it still remains a top infectious disease killer in present scenario globally. Worldwide, 9.6&#x000a0;million people are estimated to have fallen ill with TB in 2014 comprising of 5.4&#x000a0;million men, 3.2&#x000a0;million women and 1.0&#x000a0;million children. In 2014, TB killed 1.5&#x000a0;million people, the toll comprised 890 000 men, 480&#x000a0;000 women and 140&#x000a0;000 children <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Of all the countries that report their TB statistics to WHO, there are 22 countries, including India, that are referred to as the TB &#x0201c;high burden&#x0201d; countries; and they have been prioritized at a global level since 2000. They accounted for 82% of all estimated cases of TB worldwide in 2014 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. According to the WHO statistics for 2014, the estimated incidence of TB in India is 2.2&#x000a0;million cases which accounts for approximately 1/5th of global incidence <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition at least 2.7&#x000a0;lakh (270,000)&#x000a0;Indians die of TB every year <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It is estimated that about 40% of the Indian population is infected with TB with an estimate of approximately 794,046 sputum smear-positive cases reporting to RNTCP in 2014 and an overall treatment success rate for new TB patients and retreatment patients success rate being 88% and 70% respectively <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Despite the low multi-drug resistance (MDR-TB) prevalence in India (2.2% among new cases and 15% among retreatment cases), the absolute number of cases happens to be a huge figure due to the size of the population and number of TB cases reporting annually,. Thus, India ranks first among the 27 MDR-TB high-burden countries worldwide, contributing to 21% of all MDR-TB cases estimated among notified cases <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p id="para0006">To overcome the burden of this disease, India is implementing WHO endorsed Directly Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS) strategy under a national program-Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP). RNTCP is the world's largest DOTS program achieving global targets of case finding and treatment success rates <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although new technologies are under development, microscopic examination of clinical sputum specimens has been the main stay of TB case detection for over 100 years and is likely to remain the primary tool for the laboratory diagnosis of TB in resource poor countries for the foreseeable future. Microscopy is rapid, fairly inexpensive, and less labor intensive than other technologies. In addition, in the case of TB, a positive smear is indicative of a high risk of transmitting infection to others <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="para0007">As per the RNTCP guidelines, presumptive TB patients are required to submit two sputum samples, i.e. one on the spot at the time of first visit and second specimen collected at home next day morning and brought to the laboratory <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This requires at least 2 visits for sample submission and subsequent visit for report collection. Due to repeated visits and the economic constraint involved in it, the patient often abandons the diagnostic procedure, the defaulting patients contributing to spreading the disease in the community. The WHO has recently indicated that &#x0201c;same-day diagnosis&#x0201d; or the &#x0201c;front-loading&#x0201d; method of specimen collection should be done according to a phased implementation plan with due consideration given to training, human resources, laboratory work-load, infection control, and monitoring issues. According to this scheme, the presumptive TB patients are required to submit two sputum samples on first day of visit one hour apart <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It reduces number of visits of patient and helps in preventing drop-outs.</p><p id="para0008">In our study we aim to assess the accuracy of Front Loading sputum microscopy in case detection of presumptive TB patients. In view of the increase in TB cases, higher morbidity probably because of the high drop-outs and studies revealing an increased yield of acid fast bacilli (AFB) on serial sputum smear examination on same day, this study was designed to assess the feasibility of 2 serial sputum smear examination on the same day and compare the results with Standard method of sputum microscopy and gold standard <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> culture for diagnosis of presumptive TB patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="para0009">A Cross-sectional Study was carried out at the Departments of Microbiology and Medicine, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi.

In a systematic review Mase et&#x000a0;al. quantified the diagnostic yield of each of the three sputum specimens and reported an incremental yield of third specimen as 3.1% when the first two specimens were negative, similar to Rieder et&#x000a0;al. who reported increase in percentage in diagnosing presumptive TB patients from third specimen from 0.7% to 7.2% in 42 laboratories of four high-burden countries <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Majority of the sputum smear positive patients could be identified by the Front Loading sputum microscopy in our study which suggests that under routine conditions the incremental yield from a morning sample smear is relatively small, hence, examination of smears of two sputum specimens collected on the same day of first visit of patients to health care centers could be the basis for detection of presumptive TB patients in low-income, high prevalence countries like India. The cases missed by Front Loading sputum microscopy were paucibacillary cases and less than other reports <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The most probable reason for missing such cases could be the poor quality and quantity of the spot sputum specimens or the intermittent shedding of bacilli during the day. Similar to our findings other studies have reported higher bacillary load in morning specimen <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Since the mucociliary clearance is lower during the night, sputum gradually accumulates in the airways thus yielding better quality of sputum in the morning <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The slight increase in sensitivity and grading of AFB microscopy gained under the Standard method of sputum microscopy is outweighed by limitations of delay in reporting and repeated health center visits leading to drop-outs. The probable reason behind this could be the intermittent shedding of bacilli in the day when patients are active or poor quality of sputum submitted by patient on the spot.</p><p id="para0037">The average isolation rate on LJ media has ranged from 6.8% to 34.74% <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

The increase in culture positivity and decrease in turn around correlated with higher AFB grading by both methods of sputum microscopy as evidenced in other studies too <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

In another study conducted in Uganda, the number of participants who failed to return with an early morning sample was high 301/2418 (12.4%) <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The new method has potential to reduce drop-out rates of patients, but the decision to adopt this needs to consider the greater bacillary yield of the morning sample, the potential burden on laboratory technicians, and the potential inconvenience and nosocomial exposure involved in having the patient wait at the health care facility. A limitation in our study was the paucity of clinically relevant data that could have been elicited from the patients to provide a better patient profile in the study. Several newer, recommended diagnostic techniques like Line Probe assay, CB-NAAT are being increasingly available for better results in less turn-around time, though universal easy access to these is yet not there. Hence optimization in sputum microscopy remains the key to improving the diagnosis in such settings. In the recent times WHO has intended to implement the Front Loading sputum microscopy method in laboratories in a phased manner keeping in view few issues pertaining to training, human resources, laboratory work load, infection control and quality control <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0009"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="para0039">Until newer, rapid and economical tools are introduced for diagnosis of pulmonary TB in resource limited settings, sputum smear examination remains the frontline method; hence optimization of this method for increasing its rate of pulmonary TB cases detection and reducing drop-out rate of patients from the diagnostic procedure is highly important. The sensitivity and specificity of sputum microscopy using an early morning sample followed by another sputum one hour later from the same day appears not to be inferior to using two early morning samples on subsequent days. The Front Loading sputum microscopy should be implemented in RNTCP laboratories to complete sample collection from patients on the day of first visit to health care centre thus increasing compliance and decreasing drop-outs. Proper implementation of DOTS Programme and strict adherence to treatment in new diagnosed pulmonary TB patients should be the foremost step to prevent MDR-TB.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref0001"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO</collab></person-group><article-title>Global tuberculosis report</article-title><comment>Available from:</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report" id="interref0001">www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report</ext-link><year>2015</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="othref0001">TB statistics | Global, regional &#x00026; drug resistant - TBFacts.org.
