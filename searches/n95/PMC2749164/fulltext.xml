A search of study designs included randomised trials, cohort, case-control, crossover, before and after, and time series studies. After scanning of the titles, abstracts and full text articles as a first filter, a standardised form was used to assess the eligibility of the remainder. Risk of bias of randomised studies was assessed for generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up. Non-randomised studies were assessed for the presence of potential confounders and classified as being at low, medium, or high risk of bias.</p><p><bold>Data synthesis</bold> 58 papers of 59 studies were included. The quality of the studies was poor for all four randomised controlled trials and most cluster randomised controlled trials; the observational studies were of mixed quality. Meta-analysis of six case-control studies suggested that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome: handwashing more than 10 times daily (odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.57; number needed to treat=4, 95% confidence interval 3.65 to 5.52), wearing masks (0.32, 0.25 to 0.40; NNT=6, 4.54 to 8.03), wearing N95 masks (0.09, 0.03 to 0.30; NNT=3, 2.37 to 4.06), wearing gloves (0.43, 0.29 to 0.65; NNT=5, 4.15 to 15.41), wearing gowns (0.23, 0.14 to 0.37; NNT=5, 3.37 to 7.12), and handwashing, masks, gloves, and gowns combined (0.09, 0.02 to 0.35; NNT=3, 2.66 to 4.97). The combination was also effective in interrupting the spread of influenza within households. The highest quality cluster randomised trials suggested that spread of respiratory viruses can be prevented by hygienic measures in younger children and within households. Evidence that the more uncomfortable and expensive N95 masks were superior to simple surgical masks was limited, but they caused skin irritation. The incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to reduce respiratory disease remains uncertain. Global measures, such as screening at entry ports, were not properly evaluated. Evidence was limited for social distancing being effective, especially if related to risk of exposure&#x02014;that is, the higher the risk the longer the distancing period.</p><p><bold>Conclusion</bold> Routine long term implementation of some of the measures to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses might be difficult. However, many simple and low cost interventions reduce the transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses. More resources should be invested into studying which physical interventions are the most effective, flexible, and cost effective means of minimising the impact of acute respiratory tract infections.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epidemic and pandemic new viral infections pose a serious threat worldwide.

For example, in the most recent guidance document on planning for pandemic influenza from the World Health Organization, handwashing and masks were mentioned only twice and gloves and gowns once each, but vaccines and antivirals were cited 24 and 18 times, respectively.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>We carried out a systematic review to update our 2007 Cochrane review on the evidence of the effectiveness of public health measures such as isolation, distancing, and barriers to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We considered trials (individual level or cluster randomised, or quasi-randomised), observational studies (cohort and case-control designs), and any other comparative design, carried out in people of all ages and provided that some attempt had been made to control for confounding. We included any intervention to prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses from animal to human or from human to human (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, or hygiene) compared with no intervention (&#x0201c;do nothing&#x0201d;) or another intervention. We excluded vaccines and antivirals.</p><p>Outcome measures were mortality, numbers of cases of viral illness, the severity of viral illness, or proxies for any of these, and other measures of disease burden (such as admissions to hospital).</p><sec><title>Search strategy</title><p>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<italic>Cochrane Library</italic> 2009, issue 2), Medline (1966 to May week 1 2009), OldMedline (1950 to 1965), Embase (1990 to Week 18, 2009), and CINAHL (1982 to May week 1 2009); see the web extra on bmj.com for the search terms used for Medline and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (modified for OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL). No language restrictions were applied. Filters for study design included trials, cohort, case-control and crossover studies, before and after, and time series. We scanned the references of included studies for other potentially relevant studies. When necessary we corresponded with the first authors of studies to elicit further information.</p><p>We scanned the titles and abstracts of the studies identified by our search. When a study seemed to meet our eligibility criteria or information was insufficient to exclude it, we obtained the full text articles. We used a standardised form to assess the eligibility of each study, on the basis of the full article.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality assessment</title><p>We analysed randomised and non-randomised studies separately. Risk of bias in the randomised studies was assessed for the method of randomisation, generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up. Non-randomised studies were assessed for the presence of potential confounders using the appropriate Newcastle-Ottawa scales<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> for case-control and cohort studies, and a three point checklist for controlled before and after and ecological studies.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>We assigned categories for risk of bias on the basis of the number of items judged inadequate in each study: up to one inadequate item represented a low risk of bias, up to three items a medium risk, and more than three items a high risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Data extraction</title><p>Two authors (TOJ, CDM) independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified and retrieved articles. Three authors (EF, LA, GB) extracted data from the included studies and checked their accuracy on standard forms used by the Cochrane Vaccines Field, supervised and arbitrated by TOJ and CDM.</p><p>Aggregation of data depended on the study design, types of comparisons, sensitivity, and homogeneity of definitions of exposure, populations, and outcomes used. We calculated the I<sup>2</sup> statistic for each pooled estimate to assess the impact of statistical heterogeneity.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>When possible we carried out a quantitative analysis and summarised effectiveness as an odds ratio, with 95% confidence intervals. When a result was significant we calculated absolute intervention effectiveness as a percentage using the formula: intervention effectiveness=1&#x02212;odds ratio. In studies that could not be pooled we used effect measures as reported by the authors&#x02014;for example, risk ratios or incidence rate ratios, with 95% confidence intervals or, when not available, P values.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of a total 2958 potentially relevant studies scanned for the 2007 review and its 2009 update, 2790 were excluded on the basis of their titles or abstracts, and the full papers of the remaining 168 trials were retrieved.

In the trials a considerable loss of information resulted from incomplete or no reporting of randomisation,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> blinding,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> numerators and denominators,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>

Some authors seemed to confuse cohort designs with those of before and after designs, which elaborated conclusions unsupported by their data.<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p><p>Methodological quality was sometimes eroded by the need to deliver behavioural interventions in the midst of service delivery.<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> None the less, even when suboptimal designs were selected, trial authors rarely attempted to articulate potential confounders. A commonly ignored confounder specific to this area was the huge variability in incidence of viruses.<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>
<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> Sometimes this was tackled in the study design,<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> even in controlled before and after studies (one study attempted to correlate admissions for respiratory syncytial virus with circulating respiratory syncytial virus in the community).<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> One pilot study was carried out during a period of low viral circulation in the northern hemisphere (early summer), whereas the subsequent full study was carried out from January to September.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Another study attempted to link exposure (measured as nasal excretions) and infection rate in the periods before and after intervention.<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Inappropriate placebos caused design problems. In some studies the placebo probably carried sufficient effect to dilute the intervention effects.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Two attempts probably failed because placebo handkerchiefs were impregnated with a dummy compound that stung the users&#x02019; nostrils.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Some studies used impractical interventions. Volunteers subjected to the intervention hand cleaner (organic acids) were not allowed to use their hands between cleaning and virus challenge, so the effect of normal use of the hands on the intervention remains unknown.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Although 2% aqueous iodine is a successful antiviral intervention when painted on the hands it causes cosmetic staining and is impractical for all but those at the highest risk of epidemic contagion.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Compliance with interventions, especially with educational programmes and N95 masks, was a problem in several studies. N95 masks also caused harm such as rash and acne, further limiting the compliance of healthcare workers.<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Routine long term implementation of some of the measures assessed in this review would be problematic, particularly maintaining strict hygiene and barrier routines for long periods. In the absence of a real threat of a serious epidemic, this would probably be feasible only in highly motivated environments, such as hospitals. Most of the study authors commented on the considerable logistic burden imposed by barrier routines at the community level.</p></sec><sec><title>Clear benefits</title><p>The highest quality cluster randomised trials indicate that most effect on preventing the spread of respiratory viruses can be expected from hygienic measures in younger children and household members of index cases. Perhaps this is because younger children are least capable of hygienic behaviour and have longer lived infections and greater social contact, thereby acting as portals of infection into the household.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Additional benefit from reduced transmission from children to other members of the household is broadly supported by the results of other study designs where the potential for confounding is greater. The seven case-control studies suggest that implementing barriers to transmission, isolation, and hygienic measures are effective with the use of relatively cheap interventions to contain epidemics of respiratory viruses. We found limited evidence of the superior effectiveness of barrier devices to droplets such as the N95 masks over simple surgical masks. N95 masks are respirators with 95% filtration capability against non-oily particulate aerosols.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Although they are more expensive and uncomfortable (especially if worn for long periods) than simple surgical masks, they may be useful in high risk situations. We are aware of at least one randomised trial comparing different masks for influenza (NCT00756574).</p></sec><sec><title>Uncertainties</title><p>It is uncertain whether the incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing actually decreased the burden of respiratory tract disease outside the confines of the rather atypical studies reported on here. The extra benefit may have been, at least in part, accrued by confounding additional routines. Studies preventing transmission of respiratory syncytial virus and similar viruses seemed to be closer to real life and suggest good effectiveness of physical barriers. However, concerns about the methodological quality of the controlled before and after studies suggest that the benefits may have been caused by differences in the populations, especially in virus infection rates. These were poorly reported in most studies. The effectiveness of gargling with water compared with an antiseptic should be tested further in a larger trial with better masking of the possible addition of the antiseptic liquid.</p><p>The lack of proper evaluation of global and highly resource intensive measures such as screening at entry ports and social distancing was disappointing. The handful of studies (mostly done during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic) does not allow any firm conclusions. Encouragingly, differential quarantine periods based on length and intensity of exposure may have minimised the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome. This observation should be tested further when possible.</p><p>We would like to emphasise the potential importance of one study, that in the US military training facility, which suggests that as yet unknown environmental factors may be powerful stimuli in the genesis of influenza-like illness and that person to person spread may be a limited form of transmission.<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Policy and evidence</title><p>The disparity in effectiveness between the high profile of influenza vaccines and antivirals and the low profile of physical interventions is striking. Public health recommendations are almost completely based on the use of vaccines and antivirals despite the lack of strong evidence.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Vaccines work best in those who are universally considered least to need them<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02014;namely, healthy adults. Antivirals may be harmful and their benefits depend on the identification of the agent (influenza).<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> But physical interventions are effective, safe, flexible, universally applicable, and relatively cheap. There are many complex reasons for this disparity. Influenza vaccines, for instance, target only a limited proportion of influenza-like illnesses (around 10% to 7%).<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The comparative rarity of influenza as a cause of influenza-like illness affects the calculation of the effectiveness of influenza specific vaccines and antivirals. If the incidence of influenza in the unvaccinated population is low then the vaccine effectiveness ratio will be close to 1 and effectiveness low. However, physical interventions are directed against all viral diseases and therefore calculation of their effectiveness is sensitive only to the incidence of influenza-like illness, not of influenza. In addition, physical interventions are relatively cheap. The cost of masks ranges from $0.16 (&#x000a3;0.09; &#x020ac;0.11) to $1.9 each depending on make and complexity, from soft surgical masks to N95 masks.<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref> Prices are higher for well known brands and different designs and materials, although bulk purchase would result in sizeable discounts.</p><p>Our review shows that public health measures can be highly effective, especially when they are part of a structured programme that includes instruction and education and when they are delivered together. </p></sec><sec><title>Implementation of physical interventions</title><p>One major problem with physical interventions is poor compliance, especially during periods of low threat as reported in many of the included studies. All the mentioned physical interventions require change in behaviour, which is the most important barrier to implementation. A need exists to further research, introduce, and evaluate such programmes aimed at changing behaviour. Extra resources should be made available for these. Further large scale pragmatic trials to evaluate the best combinations are clearly required. Funding for these studies remains a problem, however. Randomised controlled trials with a pragmatic design, similar to the trial by Luby et al,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> should be carried out whenever possible. Perhaps the impressive effect of hygienic measures aimed at younger children is based on their poor capability of being hygienic. Although physical interventions are cheap and effective, their cost effectiveness should be evaluated in prospective studies. The role of environmental factors in the genesis of acute respiratory tract infections should be investigated further.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the findings of this review, we recommend that handwashing programmes should be implemented nationwide, their effectiveness monitored, and their cost effectiveness evaluated. In situations of high risk of transmission, barrier measures should be implemented such as wearing gloves, gowns, and masks with a filtration apparatus, and isolation of likely cases. Most effort should be concentrated on reducing transmission from young children through regular education at school on hygiene. In addition, society should invest in more comfortable and better designed face masks and barrier apparatus, which would increase compliance with their use.</p><boxed-text position="float" content-type="style3"><sec><title>What is already known on this topic</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Respiratory tract infection is the main cause of burden of disease worldwide</p></list-item><list-item><p>The world is increasingly concerned about pandemics of viral origin</p></list-item><list-item><p>Interventions to minimise the spread of infection focus on influenza specific vaccines and stockpiling of antivirals</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What this study adds</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Hygiene and physical barriers, especially handwashing, wearing masks, and isolation of potentially infected patients, are effective in preventing the spread of viral infections</p></list-item><list-item><p>These interventions should be given higher priority in the preparation and evaluation of national pandemics</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cheap and non-invasive interventions have the potential to reduce mortality and morbidity from viral respiratory tract infections</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text></sec></sec></body><back><notes><fn-group><fn><p>We thank Anne Lyddiatt, Stephanie Kondos, Tom Sandora, Kathryn Glass, Max Bulsara, Rick Shoemaker, Allen Cheng, Bill Hewak, Adi Prabhala, and Sree Nair for their comments on or contributions to present and previous versions of the review; J&#x000f8;rgen Lous for translating a Danish paper and extracting data; Ryuki Kassai for translating a Japanese paper; Taixiang Wu for translating several Chinese papers; Luca De Fiore for supplying information on costs; and Michael Broderick for supplementary study information.
