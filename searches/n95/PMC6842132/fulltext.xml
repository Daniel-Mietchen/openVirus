The aims of the present study were to clarify the difficulties in TB infection control at non-TB specialized hospitals and whether any associated risks of latent TB infection exist among health professionals in Vietnam.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We conducted a cross-sectional study in a national tertiary and general hospital of Hanoi, Vietnam. Participants were health professionals, including physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. We assessed difficulties in TB infection control by conducting a knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) survey. We also collected data on the results of tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) conducted during health check-ups for hospital staff to determine whether health professionals had latent TB infection or TB disease. KAP scores were compared among health professional groups (physicians vs. nurses vs. other health professionals). Factors influencing knowledge scores were evaluated using multiple regression analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total 440 health professionals at the study site participated in the KAP survey, and we collected the results of TSTs from a total of 299 health professionals. We observed a high prevalence of latent TB infection (74.2%), especially among participants in the emergency department. Although participants had high KAP scores, some topics were less understood, such as symptoms and risks of TB, proper use of protective equipment such as N95 respirators, and preventing transmission by patients with confirmed or suspected TB. Factors influencing knowledge scores associated with TB were age, a belief that TB is the most important infectious disease, being a medical professional, having previously attended workshops or seminars, and knowing that Vietnam has a high burden of TB.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">In a non-TB specialized hospital of Vietnam, we observed a risk of TB infection among health professionals and difficulties in properly controlling TB infection. Early awareness regarding patients with suspected TB, to apply proper measures and prevent transmission, and education regarding obtaining updated knowledge through scientific information are crucial to enhancing TB infection control in general hospitals of Vietnam.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>KAP</kwd><kwd>TB infection control</kwd><kwd>Latent tuberculosis infection</kwd><kwd>General hospital</kwd><kwd>Tuberculin skin test</kwd><kwd>N95 respirator</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Pfizer Health Research Foundation in Japan</institution></funding-source><award-id>International research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takasaki</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">Tuberculosis (TB) remains an important global health burden, with an estimated 10 million new TB cases and 1.3 million TB-related deaths worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Vietnam, the Global TB report 2018 estimated that there were 124,000 new TB cases and 12,000&#x02009;TB-related deaths in 2017, placing the country in the category of a high TB-burden country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Prevention and infection control in Vietnam remain serious challenges in reducing the TB prevalence and mortality.</p><p id="Par13">Health professionals in hospitals are at increased risk for acquiring TB, which can lead to severe medical consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In particular, health professionals at non-TB-specialized hospitals in low- and middle-income countries may face difficulties in preventing nosocomial TB infection, which may cause latent TB infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Such difficulties are owing to lower awareness of TB infection among both patients and health professionals as well as insufficient TB prevention measures in hospitals and limited human and medical resources. Furthermore, prior to receiving a diagnosis of TB, a high proportion of patients with TB visit the emergency department and outpatient clinics that treat high-risk diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although guidelines for TB infection control are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], implementation must be modified according to the health care setting, such as whether the hospital has the role of making an initial diagnosis (non-TB-specialized general hospitals) or receiving patients already diagnosed with TB (TB-specialized hospitals).</p><p id="Par14">A knowledge, attitude, practice (KAP) survey is used to assess a person&#x02019;s understanding, related thoughts and beliefs, and skills. KAP assessments can also provide useful data regarding deficits and gaps in TB control measures, which can help in focusing on subsequent infection control strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Given the importance of reducing nosocomial TB transmission, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends use of a KAP survey as a valuable tool when considering TB control strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Several studies from high TB-burden countries have previously reported the results of KAP surveys conducted among health professionals in terms of TB control and treatment strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, according to our understanding, difficulties in TB infection control at tertiary general hospitals in Vietnam have not been comprehensively assessed, including investigation of difficulties among health professionals, problems with facilities, and the epidemiology of latent TB infection among health professionals.</p><p id="Par15">The aim of the present study was thus to clarify whether health professionals at a general hospital in a high TB-burden country (Vietnam) have appropriate KAP related to TB infection control. Screening for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection using the tuberculin skin test (TST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] was also performed among health professionals, to identify any existing factors associated with latent TB infection. The results of this study will contribute to improving the health status of the population in Vietnam including the TB infection control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study structure</title><p id="Par16">The present study consisted of two parts: 1) a KAP survey conducted among health professionals, to identify measures taken in TB infection control at a general hospital in Vietnam, a high TB-burden country; 2) TSTs performed among these health professionals to determine their KAP related to the infection of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, as the examination for latent TB infection or TB disease.</p><p id="Par17">This study was approved by the institutional review board of National Bach Mai Hospital (BMH).

In the Vietnamese health care system, treatment and hospitalization of patients with TB are carried out in TB-specialized hospitals. Only the initial diagnosis of TB is made at non-TB-specialized general hospitals, and patients are immediately transferred to a TB-specialized hospital if a diagnosis of TB is received. However, the central hospital is responsible for attending patients who are unable to be adequately treated in local hospital settings, such as provincial and district hospitals. Therefore, BMH was selected as the site for the present study as a high-risk medical organization, despite being a non-TB specialized hospital.</p><p id="Par19">Among 3165 employees in the BMH, 594 full-time health professionals (physicians, nurses, other health professionals, and medical clerks) work in departments with high TB risk including respiratory centers; the emergency; the infectious disease, nephrology, hematology, and endocrinology departments, and outpatient clinics. These health professionals were selected as the study participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>KAP survey methodology</title><p id="Par20">We carried out the questionnaire survey in June 2018.

The questionnaire was designed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to TB infection and disease. To identify the occupational risk of TB infection, the questionnaire was also designed to collect the following information: demographics, time working in the current position, work experience in departments with high TB risk, TB history, TB history of family members, comorbidities, and Bacillus Calmette&#x02013;Guerin (BCG) vaccination history. The English version of the survey, comprising 53 questions, was translated into Vietnamese, then back-translated into English for validation. All questions were multiple choice or closed-ended, and participants chose their responses from a provided set of answers (Yes/No, True/False, or Agree/Disagree/Undecided).</p><p id="Par21">The KAP survey was conducted on 2&#x02009;days in June 2018.

A high prevalence of latent TB infection among health professionals was observed, in particular those in the emergency department. Providing educational programs and obtaining knowledge from scientific sources among health professionals would help in reducing nosocomial TB infection.</p><p id="Par39">In the health care system of Vietnam, as the central hospital, BMH (the study site) cares for patients who have difficulty with clinical treatment in local hospital settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, whereas treatment for patients with TB is provided in TB-specialized hospitals, there is a high likelihood that health professionals in the central hospital see patients who have not yet been diagnosed with TB or who are unaware of having TB but are transported to that hospital. As a result, a high proportion of physicians and nurses at our study site had previously treated patients with TB and suspected TB. Previous autopsy studies in a tertiary referral hospital in other high TB-burden countries also identified a high incidence of TB among patients who were not suspected of having TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; it can be therefore be thought that the occupational risk of TB infection among health professionals may be high. In particular, in the present study, the greatest proportion of TST-positive results was among health professionals in the emergency department. A large number of patients who are transferred from local hospitals and admitted to the emergency department may not be aware of their TB status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This result was compatible with previous studies in South Korea and the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Specific TB control measures, including rapid diagnosis of TB in patients transferred to the emergency department are crucial with the current diagnostic methods, which require substantial time. The finding of an abnormal chest radiograph would be a clue for earlier diagnosis of TB, together with the identification of risk factors and symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">In a high TB burden country, appropriate and necessary information of TB is crucial for health professionals in medical facilities, even if they are employed at non-TB-specialized hospitals. In the present study, the main information resource among physicians was university faculties, and that for nurses and other professionals was news media. In addition, the prevalence of physicians, nurses, and other professionals who had ever attended educational programs on TB was low. Although the knowledge scores of each group were high, as health professionals who provide the first diagnosis of TB and provide care for patients with suspected TB, some knowledge gaps were observed, especially in terms of understanding the symptoms and diseases associated with the risk of TB. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of TB has been previously reported in Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Knowledge about TB transmission is required, as are practices for preventing TB infection, including patient isolation and use of an N95 respirator. These respirators have a high filtration barrier, to protect health professionals from TB infection. N95 respirators are recommended for health professionals caring for patients with TB or suspected TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, among participants in the present study, the adherence to N95 respirator use was not observed owing to poor understanding of respirator use. Understanding the importance of respirators by hospital administration for TB infection control and training in the appropriate use of N95 respirators must be included in educational programs for health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our results of multiple regression analysis indicated that providing proper and comprehensive knowledge regarding TB and TB infection control via workshops or seminars for physicians as well as nurses and other health professionals would help to increase their knowledge. Higher knowledge levels about TB among health professionals and subsequent changes in their attitudes and behaviours would contribute to reducing nosocomial TB infections.</p><p id="Par42">The present study had some limitations. Most measurements relied on self-reporting by health professionals. Although the survey was conducted in an anonymized fashion, the possibility of bias cannot be ignored. The number of participants with TST results was smaller than the number who participated the KAP survey because TSTs were conducted during professionals&#x02019; working hours. Therefore, we did not statistically assess the correlation between the results of KAP surveys and the prevalence of latent TB infection. Further investigation is needed among equal numbers of participants with results for both the KAP survey and TST. Although we examined participants for latent TB infection, we were not able to determine whether infection occurred at the hospital or elsewhere. This study was conducted in a single hospital in Hanoi and included health professionals in limited departments. Therefore, the conditions may differ from TB infection control in local settings. Despite these limitations, the present results can contribute to the improvement of TB infection control in general hospitals of Vietnam.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">Although health professionals had high KAP scores, we identified gaps in their knowledge about proper TB infection control, including understanding of self-protection using an N95 respirator and immediate isolation of patients with (suspected) TB. Early awareness of (suspected) TB to prevent transmission, as well as education about obtaining TB knowledge from scientific sources among health professionals, will help in reducing nosocomial TB infection and in implementing proper measures when caring for patients with (suspected) TB. A high prevalence of latent TB infection among health professionals may also suggest the need to strengthen TB infection control, particularly among health professionals in the emergency department.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BCG</term><def><p id="Par5">Bacillus Calmette&#x02013;Guerin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMH</term><def><p id="Par6">Bach Mai Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p id="Par7">Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KAP</term><def><p id="Par8">Knowledge, attitude, and practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TB</term><def><p id="Par9">Tuberculosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TST</term><def><p id="Par10">Tuberculin skin test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par11">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Tamami Manabe and D&#x00169;ng Kimball Phan for their general assistance.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: NQC and TM.
