The relatively high prevalence of TB in Texas creates a concern for patients and health care professionals (HCP), making TB exposure a safety issue [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. TB remains a challenge for health care systems in the United States. In the recent past, there were multiple reports of patients acquiring the infection while receiving medical care. This is partly due to the complexity of making a diagnosis, atypical nature of clinical presentation in many cases, and delay in identification of cases, perhaps due in part to the perception that TB is a problem of the past [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. TB transmission in health care settings may go undetected and in some low-prevalence countries; it is only suspected by epidemiological links in about 25% of the cases [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, if transmission occurs and subsequent infections are diagnosed, many patients and HCP choose not to receive or do not complete latent TB infection (LTBI) therapy [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB are endemic in some parts of the world, and globally about 20% of isolates are resistant to at least 1 firstline TB medication [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This is critical because about two-thirds of active TB cases occur among foreign-born individuals, and most of the reported TB cases were from individuals born in Asian countries or Mexico [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>A deviation from CDC guidelines due to the delay in suspecting and diagnosing active TB or placing patients with suspected active TB under appropriate isolation precautions has been associated with an increased rate of LTBI among HCP. This has been described in multiple reports of health care&#x02013;associated outbreaks [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;14</xref>]. In this study, we describe the magnitude of burden, clinical features, and risk factors associated with exposure to a patient with microbiologically confirmed active pulmonary TB.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study Design and Population</title><p>This is a retrospective case-control study performed at 5 health care systems in Texas over an 8-year period, January 2005 to December 2012. The study sites included 3 VA health care systems: South Texas Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS), Central Texas Veterans Healthcare System, Temple (CTVHCS), Valley Coastal Bend Veterans Healthcare System (VCBVHCS), and 2 public safety-net health care systems, University Health System at San Antonio (UHS) and Parkland Health and Hospital System, Dallas (PHHS), located in Texas. The hospitals had both teaching services (including resident trainees) and nonteaching services. The study included inpatients and outpatients. We combined the data from STVHCS and VCBVHCS because they were 1 system during part of the study and had a unified infection control program.</p><p>The aim of the study is to evaluate clinical, demographic, epidemiological, and radiological features and clinical management of TB patients and to compare microbiologically confirmed pulmonary TB patients who were sources of unprotected exposure to TB in health care settings (cases) with those patients who did not result in TB exposure (controls). All patients included had active TB with positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in sputum or respiratory cultures, with or without extrapulmonary compromise.</p><p>Data were collected using a standardized database in Excel. Each investigator completed a case report form and transferred it to the shared secure database. Case reports were validated by the study coordinator and the principal investigator as they were entered to ensure data quality. Adult patients meeting the definition of active TB (TB with pulmonary involvement by positive respiratory tract cultures consistent with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) during January 2005 to December 2012 were included in the analysis.</p><p>The study was divided in 2 parts. In the first part, TB patients who led to an exposure were identified based on review of the medical records at each site. These data included the number of exposed contacts detected by the infection control teams at each institution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We defined a TB exposure to have occurred when a patient with active TB was not isolated after the first evaluation by a licensed independent practitioner or the patient did not have a surgical mask put on after first contact with the health care system, usually at the registration, resulting in potential TB exposure to other patients or health care workers.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Characteristics of Each Health Care System (January 2005&#x02013;December 2012)</p></caption><table frame="vsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Location</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PHHS</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UHS</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTVHCS</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">STVHCS/VCBVHCS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TB exposure</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No documentation of mask application on the patient at the time of arrival in the emergency department and/or no documentation of airborne isolation placement in the hospital</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Health care workers and patients who are identified as having had interactions with a patient diagnosed with active transmissible tuberculosis prior to the patient being placed in an appropriate room and N95 masks being utilized are considered potential exposures</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infection Prevention considers an exposure to TB to be one that occurs prior to the initiation of any control measures (i.e., N95 respirator usage, negative pressure rooms).</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Respiratory etiquette not initiated in the clinic setting at the first opportunity to do so (patient was not given a barrier mask), and the staff members did not use appropriate N95 respirator while examining or treating the patient</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Services</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">900-bed tertiary care medical care that treats medical, surgical, transplant, burn care trauma, and high-risk obstetrics</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">500-bed tertiary care medical care that treats medical, surgical, and trauma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">520-bed tertiary care medical care that treats medical, surgical, trauma, and outpatient clinics</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1450-bed tertiary care medical care that treats medical, surgical, transplant patients, and outpatient clinics</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dates of data collecton</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">01/01/2009 to 12/31/2011</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">01/01/2008 to 12/31/2012</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">01/01/2008 to 12/31/2010</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">01/01/2005 to 12/31/2012</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="fn-01" fn-type="other"><p>Abbreviations: CTVHCS, Central Texas Veterans Healthcare System; PHHS, Parkland Health and Hospital System; STVHCS, Dallas South Texas Veterans Health Care System; UHS, University Health System at San Antonio; VCBVHCS, Valley Coastal Bend Veterans Healthcare System.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In the second part, we evaluated documentation in the charts of all TB patients, those who led to potential TB exposures (cases) as well as those who were isolated at presentation and did not lead to further exposures (controls).

Although the incidence of TB cases declined overall during 2009&#x02013;2014, the number of cases increased by 1.6% in 2015 [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We found in our study that despite implementation of the CDC guidelines to prevent tuberculosis in health care settings [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], inadequate isolation resulting in potential exposure to health care professionals and patients is common (n = 199, 59%). Failure to isolate patients with active TB is not uncommon in North America [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A study performed in Canada including 429 patients admitted with active pulmonary TB to 17 hospitals over a 3-year period found that TB diagnoses were initially missed in 45% of cases, and even after 1 week, 30% of the patients were still not properly treated [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The treatment costs for patients with TB range from $28 000 per patient [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] for a patient with drug-susceptible tuberculosis to $134 000 for MDR TB and $430 000 for XDR TB [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, the cost of TB contact tracing is significant, including the time of frontline staff to compile the list of potentially exposed individuals, the infection preventionist time to coordinate the exposure evaluation and send notification letters to patients and HCP, the time and direct cost to screen HCP for LTBI with tuberculin skin testing or interferon gamma release assays, the costs in time of work lost for HCP and patients during LTBI testing, and the cost of therapy for LTBI infection among those found to be infected among others [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we found that the presence of extrapulmonary TB involvement was associated with significantly lower risk for inadequate isolation and, consequently, less unprotected exposure of health care professionals and patients to TB. Patients with extrapulmonary involvement such as involvement of spine, meninges, and other organs were probably more likely to be appropriately isolated because they tend to be more ill and they may additionally have multi-organ involvement that allows earlier diagnosis upon admission. A previous study in a low-prevalence setting found that patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB involvement had a higher 6-month mortality when compared with pulmonary TB [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Being a transplant recipient, having chest radiograph findings considered to be typical for TB such as upper lobe consolidation or cavitary lesions, and sputum positivity for AFB upon staining (graded +1 to +4) were associated with increased risk of inadequate isolation, and therefore potentially greater likelihood of unprotected exposure of TB bacilli to health care professionals and other patients.</p><p>We evaluated whether there was a significant correlation between HIV and TB coinfection and delays in isolation, and we did not find a significant association. In a previously published study, about 28% of chest radiographs performed on HIV-positive patients with culture-positive TB are read as normal [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing active TB (especially solid organ transplant patients), and we found that they are more likely to have inadequate isolation in our study. TB diagnosis may be challenging due to the presence of immunosuppression, low sensitivity and reproducibility of tests used to diagnose latent TB infection before transplant, and the potential for atypical presentation [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>We also found that chest radiograph findings typical for TB (defined as upper segment of lower lobe infiltrates or middle lobe/upper lobe infiltrates, presence of cavitary disease, miliary disease) were associated with increased risk of exposures. Chest radiographs with classic TB findings are not specific (with many non-TB pathologies sharing radiological features) and may be inaccurately interpreted in low-prevalence settings [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is not possible to ascertain why this correlation occurred, but we hypothesize that health care providers are not as familiar with TB given the declining prevalence of this disease, and TB was lower on their differential [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Positive sputum staining for AFB was associated with increased risk of unprotected exposure to TB in our study. This could be due to a delay in ordering sputum AFB testing in a patient not initially suspected to have TB. The CDC recommends that patients undergoing testing for TB are placed in respiratory isolation during the evaluation [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The main limitation of our study is its retrospective nature. The study was performed at 5 health care systems in a state with a relatively high rate of TB. Because of its retrospective nature, we were not able to standardize criteria for what constituted inadequate isolation at each health care system leading to a contact tracing investigation. We observed that risk of having cases was significantly different depending on the health care system where the patients were enrolled. Different infection control personnel and practices at the various health care systems could result in variability in evaluation. The actual risk of TB transmission is dependent on numerous variables that include patient factors (ie, cavitation on chest radiographs, degree of sputum positivity on the AFB smear), the setting where the potential TB exposure occurred (ie, higher risk in small closed spaces and during prolonged periods of time), and the procedures performed on the patient (ie, respiratory tract manipulation, including intubation). However, this variation between facilities and the different clinical factors that determine actual risk of TB transmission in health care settings is reflective of &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; issues in tuberculosis control.</p><p>Early clinical suspicion and prompt placement in airborne isolation, as well as maintaining the isolation for an appropriate duration warranted by the clinical presentation, are critical for employee safety and to save unnecessary time and effort expended by infection control and employee health staff in tracing contacts and doing follow-up exposure testing.</p><p>TB exposure due to inadequate isolation is relatively frequent in health care settings. Our review has shown that HIV infection, transplant recipient status, and classic TB findings on chest radiographs were significantly associated with a TB patient being a source of exposure, whereas extrapulmonary involvement, history of previously treated TB, and admission to a teaching service resulted in earlier clinical suspicion and better timeliness and duration of isolation, leading to fewer potential exposures. Infection control departments in the United States can utilize the results of this study to further refine TB and infection control risk assessments. Because of the substantial costs and resources needed for contact tracing, investigation, and management of exposed individuals in health care systems, the results of this study highlight the importance of TB prevention training and maintaining appropriate clinical suspicion to aid in early diagnosis and appropriate isolation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to the Infection Prevention and Occupational Health departments of all the health systems for sharing data.
