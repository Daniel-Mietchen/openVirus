However, not all learners enter IHEs with the same level of knowledge, attitude, and previous experience, which puts undue burden on host supervisors and poses risks to student and patient safety. The Multiple Mini-Interview (MMI) is a technique that has become a popular method for undergraduate and postgraduate-level health science admissions programs. This paper describes the MMI process used by our program to screen first-year medical students applying for pre-clinical IHEs. Two country-specific cases were developed to assess non-cognitive skills. One hundred percent (100%) of the students (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;48) and interviewers (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) who participated in MMIs completed anonymous surveys on their experience. The majority of students rated the scenarios as realistic (&#x0003e;90%); 96% found the MMI format fair and balanced; 96% of students felt that they were able to clearly articulate their thoughts; 75% of students stated that they had a general understanding of how the MMIs worked; only 33% of students would have preferred a traditional one-to-one interview. Feedback from both interviewers and students was positive toward the MMI experience, and no students were identified as unfit for participation. Ultimately, 43 students participated in pre-clinical IHEs in 2016. In this paper, we will outline our MMI process, detail shortcomings, and discuss our next steps to screen medical students for IHEs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Multiple Mini Interviews</kwd><kwd>MMIs</kwd><kwd>Global Health Education</kwd><kwd>International Health Electives</kwd><kwd>IHEs</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>None</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><table-count count="6"/><ref-count count="24"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Health science students throughout the United States and Canada express increasing interest in opportunities to study abroad. Both the number of health science trainees participating in international health elective (IHE) courses and the number of institutions offering these IHE courses continue to rise. As a result, global health programs are called upon to organize formal pre-departure training that addresses, among other topics, the ethics of short-term medical volunteerism. The need for pre-departure training was highlighted as a key aspect of ethical global health training by Sugarman and Crump and the Working Group on Ethics Guidelines for Global Health Training (WEIGHT) [<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. These guidelines promote an ethical approach to IHEs that optimizes both patient and trainee safety. Although pre-departure training for IHEs is far from standardized or mandated for all global health experiences, progress has been made. Many sending institutions and organizations now realize that the need for such training exists [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. Pre-departure training methods and evaluations are becoming the norm in peer-reviewed publications and presentations at key global health meetings. Repositories of educational materials developed and vetted by leading global health education professionals have also seen growth in recent years [<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>].</p><p>The WEIGHT committee listed the following as an ethical principle to follow when sending students on global health experiences:
<disp-quote><p><italic>Select trainees who are adaptable, motivated to address global health issues, sensitive to local priorities, willing to listen and learn, whose abilities and experience matches the expectations of the position, and who will be good representatives of their home institution and country</italic> ([<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>], p. 1190).</p></disp-quote></p><p>At this time, there is no literature that outlines a method to implement this guideline and select trainees with characteristics most suited to participate in IHEs.</p><p>Behavioral issues, mismatched expectations, and mental health difficulties place an undue burden on host sites and thus may have a negative impact on global health partnerships and, most importantly, patient care. Conversely, selecting appropriate trainees for specific field sites helps match student expectations with field site capabilities, and decrease conflict points between trainees and their potential supervisors. Appropriate selection should also identify trainees who may need additional remediation prior to travel either for academic or behavioral expectations and to screen students who are ill-suited for international travel and IHEs in general.</p><sec id="S0001-S2001"><title/><sec id="S0001-S2001-S3001"><title>What are MMIs?</title><p>Over the past several years, increasing numbers of undergraduate and postgraduate health science training programs have begun using Multiple Mini-Interviews (MMIs) in their admissions programs. Multiple Mini Interviews (MMIs) are a series of highly structured, focused stations or encounters with separate interviewers or observers [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. During the interview, participants are rated on their skill at deciphering an ethical conflict or problem and articulate a response to the hypothetical situation that reflects elements of emotional intelligence or psychological maturity [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. The purpose of the MMI is not to develop a station where there is a right or wrong answer, but rather to develop stations that can illuminate interviewee skills such as critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and personal and social awareness [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0001-S2001-S3002"><title>History of MMIs</title><p>Multiple Mini Interviews (MMIs) were first piloted by McMaster University in Ontario, Canada as a new, more valid method of medical school applicant screening [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. MMIs were designed to elicit details of applicants&#x02019; abilities in areas such as interpersonal skills, communication skills, teamwork skills, and professionalism, which are highly valued in the health professions [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. Traditional interview methods have been found to have poor predictive validity. Furthermore, they are fraught with inter-rater reliability and problems related to the implicit bias of interviewers. Currently, health professions schools in the areas of dentistry, physician&#x02019;s assistant, pharmacy, paramedicine, nursing, and midwifery; medical schools; and residency programs in North America and the United Kingdom are using the MMI for selecting candidates for their programs [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0001-S2001-S3003"><title>Traditional interviews versus MMIs for admissions decisions</title><p>When evaluating for specific attitudes or behaviors, traditional interviews have been shown to have poor inter-rater reliability, susceptible to bias, and outcomes have been found to be related to context-specificity, not the performance of the interviewee [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. Additionally, traditional interviews are time-intensive and taxing as they can last a wide-ranging timeframe depending on the situation [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Furthermore, traditional interviews have not been found to have a high predictive value for future success in clinical training, while grade point average (GPA) and other quantitative measures only predict success in the pre-clinical years [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, MMIs allow multiple encounters between applicants and many different interviewers, thus reducing bias and allowing students who may perform poorly in one encounter to start fresh in a new encounter [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Additionally, MMIs are highly structured, with all applicants encountering the same cases and rating scales [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. Previous MMI evaluations have suggested that the MMI format produces more valid results and has better predictive value than standard interviews because it allows for a more holistic view of an applicant based on multiple observers [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. Reduced time with applicants has been cited as both a pro and con of the MMI format (5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;min compared to 45-min traditional interviews) [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0001-S2001-S3004"><title>UTMB global health MMI</title><p>In 2016, we implemented the Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) to select first-year pre-clinical medical students for IHEs based on the guidelines established by WEIGHT.

Interviewers included faculty, staff, and students. A 1-h training session was held with interviewers to explain the MMI process, go over interviewer instructions, review the case scenarios, and answer questions regarding how to use the candidate-rating rubric. Notably, interviewers were selected based on previous experience with the particular challenges of each field site.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2003"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-eight first-year preclinical medical students participated in the MMI screening process in 2015.

The space proved optimal due to the waiting area, individual rooms with two-way mirrors and audio, public announcement system, and a secondary exit door. The MMI process was after business hours on one day, during a 3-h timeframe. Students received an email with an interview time 6&#x000a0;days prior to the interview date. Second-year medical student volunteers organized students in the waiting room and presented each interviewing student with written instructions at check-in and a starting room number. A staff member utilized the public announcement system to time the encounters and move students to next station. As per previously published MMI formats [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>], students were given 2 min to read the scenario and 8 min to discuss the case with the interviewer. Students completed optional anonymous paper-based evaluations upon completion of the two stations (<xref rid="app0007">Appendix G</xref>).

Such a process should aim to match the most appropriate students with the most suitable field site based on host institution feedback. This process should also reduce disciplinary and professionalism issues. Our use of the MMI format to screen medical students for IHEs allowed interviewers to have personal contact with each applicant and listen to student responses to case scenarios involving real world ethical dilemmas. Both students and interviewers rated the MMI experience highly.</p><p>The MMI process ultimately presented some limitations in our screening ability. Interviewers felt constrained by the rigid structure, which prevented them from being able to delve into topics in greater depth. The limited range of interview scores (21&#x02013;24) highlights the lack of differentiation among students. We might attribute the lack of differentiation to the homogeneity of our student applicants; or perhaps the MMI assessment was not designed to provide a wider distribution of scores. Interviewers felt the scenarios, while real world examples, allowed students to provide canned responses that did not reflect deeper thought about the downstream consequences of their actions on the community, partnership, or patient safety. This may have contributed to the lack of differentiation. Students felt that they did not have the time or the opportunity to discuss topics more deeply or to communicate why they wanted to participate in an IHE at a particular field site. Recently, it has been suggested that generalizability is an inherent limitation of MMIs due to the need to customize MMIs to the specific content and context needed [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. We see this as also a benefit of the MMI, allowing global health programs to develop MMI screenings that match program philosophy and learner type.</p><sec id="S0005-S2001"><title/><sec id="S0005-S2001-S3001"><title>Lessons learned and possible solutions</title><p><table-wrap id="UT0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/10872981.2018.1483694-UT0001</object-id><!--OASIS TABLE HERE--><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup><col width="1*" align="left"/><col width="1*" align="left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">Lesson learned</th><th align="center">Possible solution</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">&#x025cf; Cases too straightforward</td><td align="left">&#x025cf; Restructure cases with multiple defensible courses of actions<break/>&#x025cf; More probing questions with fewer limitations<break/>&#x025cf; More time for interviews</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x025cf; Not enough time</td><td align="left">&#x025cf; Allocate more time</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x025cf; Multiple issues per scenario</td><td align="left">&#x025cf; Develop more scenarios with fewer ethical dilemmas per scenario</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="S0005-S2002"><title>Next steps</title><p>The MMI experiment was an important first step in improving our student selection process for IHEs to align with established ethical guidelines for IHEs. Selecting appropriate students for global health fieldwork remains a high priority. For the 2017 preclinical preceptorship period, we have built upon our previous experience to deploy a new interview strategy that combines elements of the MMI with structured panel interviews. The structured panel interview will be added to help differentiate students. The interview panels will be composed of the UTMB mentor for each field site or field site region, a second global health educator, and a previous student selected by the UTMB mentor. Students will be assigned to a panel based on a pre-screening of their ranked field site preferences.</p><p>Future studies should explore the long-term impact of student selection on host site satisfaction, community satisfaction, and clinical or research productivity as appropriate for the rotation type. Additionally, future evaluations of selection methods for IHEs should include a plan for reporting and documenting professionalism and behavioral issues.</p></sec><sec id="S0005-S2003"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Selecting students for global health field experience is a complicated process. There is scant literature that describes best practices for selecting students for IHEs. Very few published papers address desired characteristics of global health student participants [<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. Pre-departure training, although not standardized, is now a focus for academic institutions that send health professional students abroad for global health education experiences. To ethically engage international partners in limited-resource settings with students, it is imperative to develop best practices for selecting students who possess characteristics that will position them to add value during international fieldwork. Some behaviors and characteristics, such as flexibility, professionalism, empathy, and ethical understanding are crucial for successful global health fieldwork. These factors are notoriously difficult to instill through pre-departure training [<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]. This pilot evaluation leads to a better understanding of what is needed for an effective screening process. We hope that our experience will inform other global health programs that want to bring their student selection processes in line with the most current ethical guidelines.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="S0006"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Crump</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Sugarman</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ethics and best practice guidelines for training experiences in global health</article-title>. <source>Am J Trop Med Hyg</source>. <year>2010</year><month>12</month>;<volume>83</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>1178</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>10</lpage>. <comment>PubMed PMID: 21118918; PubMed Central PMCID: PMCPMC2990028.

You have been told that there is a code of conduct and some expectations for all students such as a curfew at 8 pm, no drinking alcohol, and communal meals. However, local Kenyan students tell you that these rules are not heavily enforced and that sometimes they have parties with alcohol.</p><p>You have become close friends with some of the final year Kenyan medical students (interns), and it is your last week in Kenya. The interns have invited you to a party located 20 km from the hospital campus where you are staying. All of the UTMB students have been invited. In Kenya, it is a great honor to be invited to celebrations, and you do not want to hurt their feelings by turning down the invitation.</p><p>As you are getting ready to leave, you notice that all of the Kenyan students are taking moto-taxis (motorcycles) to the party. It is a common mode of transportation in Kenya and involves riding on a motorcycle without a helmet and with several passengers. UTMB students are supposed to use the private transportation service, but it is three times the cost and you are running low on funds.</p><p>When you arrive at the party, you realize that alcohol is being served.

Before arrival, you were preparing to do a research project focused on emerging infectious disease epidemiology, which would give you some time in the lab and in the field collecting data. Two weeks into your rotation the IRB has still not been approved and your UTMB mentor and your host mentor are working on preparing an alternative project for you. In the meantime, you are told to accompany the medical teaching service on rounds in the hospital.</p><p>During your first day of rounds, many of the patients you see are presenting with chronic cough and fever and are being evaluated for Tuberculosis, a disease that you know from your PHD course to be highly contagious. You have an N95 mask in your pocket, but notice that no one else seems to be wearing them.</p><p>After rounds, the resident tells you to come with her to see &#x02018;a really interesting case.&#x02019; When you arrive at the bedside you see a 16 year-old girl who is confused and complaining of headache. The resident tells you that she thinks this patient has TB Meningitis. He introduces you to the mother and tells her &#x02018;this doctor will do the LP.&#x02019;</p><p>Questions:
