There have been three major influenza pandemics in the 20th century: the &#x0201c;Spanish Flu&#x0201d; (Influenza H1N1) in 1918, the &#x0201c;Asian Flu&#x0201d; (H2N2) in 1957, and the &#x0201c;Hong Kong Flu&#x0201d; (H3N2) in 1968.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The latter two pandemics resulted in estimated worldwide deaths of 2 million in 1957 and 1 million in 1968. Although estimates vary on the total number of deaths credited with these pandemics, most agree that <italic>at least</italic> 50 million died from the Spanish Flu between 1918 and 1919, with deaths predominantly occurring within a few days of infection.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> And, of all the deaths from the 1918 pandemic, over half the dead were young, healthy adults, an uncommon phenomenon with seasonal flu illness. Scientists concluded that origins of the strains of influenza virus causing the 3 pandemics were viruses containing combinations of genes from both a human influenza virus and an avian influenza virus.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> As an aside, in this era of bioterrorism preparedness, it is important to note that the reassortment of influenza genes could be employed for the creation of biological weapons.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Avian influenza therefore represents a likely pathogen to cause the next pandemic, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC). WHO issued a report in December 2004 in which the threat of an influenza pandemic occurring in the near future has greater likelihood with the recent appearance and wide spread of avian influenza H5N1.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> A pandemic is generally considered to be a global outbreak, ie, a pathogen that causes a multi-continent epidemic. H5N1 meets that criterion if you consider birds, given chickens, geese, pigeons, and other fowl have been afflicted from Asia to Europe. There have been several thousand outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry from 2003 to April 2007 worldwide, with most occurring in Vietnam (2,373) and Thailand (1,137), and the fewest in France, Germany, Jordan, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Kazakhstan, Djibouti, Cameroon, and Saudi Arabia each with 1 confirmed outbreak (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). WHO warns that the next influenza pandemic could result in the deaths of between 2 and 7 million people, with tens of millions requiring hospitalization, including treatment in intensive care units.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> This is a WHO &#x0201c;best case&#x0201d; scenario, modeled after the &#x0201c;milder&#x0201d; pandemics in the 20th century. WHO considers the pandemic of 1918 to be &#x0201c;extraordinary&#x0201d; and thus have chosen to model the 1957/1968 outbreaks. However, if one were to model the potential impact HPAI H5N1 could have if it were to become the causative agent of a pandemic, based on the 1918 pandemic, the death toll expected would be exponentially greater than the more conservative estimates given above.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> What makes the WHO 2004 report especially prescient, not long after it was published, in 2005, there occurred a significant increase in the spread of the avian influenza strain H5N1, resulting in millions of birds and hundreds of humans subsequently being affected (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>

Avian influenza was first identified over 100 years ago in Italy.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In 1955 studies revealed that all subtypes of influenza A viruses have been detected in more than 90 species of otherwise apparently healthy wild birds.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses are wild waterfowl, gulls, and shorebirds. Usually the gastrointestinal tract is involved, thus the risk of exposure when coming in contact with excreta. Historically, it is likely that these species of birds have carried avian influenza viruses without developing symptoms; such is an optimal condition of adaptation, especially virus to host. Given these birds are migratory, ie, highly mobile, they are known to carry viruses over great distances. These birds can excrete significant viral loads in their feces, yet remain healthy. Until recently, avian influenza viruses have been considered relatively nondangerous to birds and extremely rare findings in humans. When these infections did occur in humans, only mild illness occurred, usually conjunctivitis followed by full recovery. H5N1 has proven dramatically to be an exception, causing death to animals and humans. Of note, given that H5N1 is killing animals that normally are not affected by avian influenza viruses, this suggests that the virus has adapted and thus increased its virulence (a virus&#x02019; capacity to harm or kill). Since infected birds will excrete the virus, such commonness of bird feces promotes contamination of food, water, environment, and other animals, increasing the likelihood of human illness.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The majority of the infections were the result of human to animal proximity in mostly agricultural countries with often substandard hygienic practices. It is thus easy to understand why environment and cultural cooking practices are of paramount concern. Eating raw eggs, poultry blood, or undercooked bird meat, playing &#x0201c;catch&#x0201d; with chicken heads, and domiciles shared with animals have been the primary routes of contamination for infected people.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>

A total of 15 subtypes of influenza are known to infect birds, resulting in an extensive reservoir; this poses a significant challenge to governments and international public health efforts to contain an infection that can literally travel on the very winds the birds can fly! Of additional concern, low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) can mutate into HPAI. An example of this was the H5N2 virus that circulated in the United States in 1983 to 1984. It began as an LPAI with a low mortality rate, but within 6 months it became an HPAI associated with a 90% mortality rate. Italy experienced a similar event; an H7N1 LPAI virus mutated within 9 months into an HPAI form, resulting in the death&#x02014;disease or culling&#x02014;of greater than 13 million birds.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

Though beyond the scope of this article, it is important to remember that most of our healthcare facilities are overcrowded, understaffed, and not designed to function as isolation or quarantine facilities. The number of negative pressure rooms, intensive care units, and isolation capabilities varies widely across regions and healthcare centers. The world of competing demands and financial cut-backs is an omnipresent reality for healthcare professionals today. Yet the number of emerging pathogens, changes in virulence patterns among known infections such as tuberculosis (TB) evolving beyond simply being multidrug resistant towards extremely drug resistant TB (XDR TB) are today&#x02019;s reality. In the event of a SARS or avian influenza outbreak, we must be prepared to handle large numbers of potentially contagious patients (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">FIG 9</xref>, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">FIG 10</xref>).
This requires having a well thought out plan in place that utilizes input from all major stakeholders, has been practiced and buttressed by the knowledge that participants have appropriate tools to carry out the plan&#x02014;equipment, training, personnel, countermeasures (medicines)&#x02014;and are trained in the appropriate use of such materials. Having appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as n-95 respirators (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>) isn&#x02019;t enough.

Developing mutual aid agreements with HCF or organizations, perhaps in different regions, that may have greater resources or equipment, is one option to strengthening response capabilities.

Failure to perform appropriate hand hygiene is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections, the spread of multi-drug resistant organisms, and contributes to outbreaks. Approximately 1 in 20 patients contracts an infection in hospitals across the US. About 2 million patients acquire nosocomial infections each year in US hospitals; the war against infectious diseases is clearly not over.<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>
</p><p id="para0615">Overcrowded waiting rooms, healthcare facilities lacking surge capacity and filled to overflowing give less time for proper sanitation.

Lack of hospital beds exacerbates the problem. Given that influenza occurs seasonally and predictably, exerting profound effects on the population causing over 36,000 deaths annually and 200,000 hospitalizations, widespread influenza activity in a region can severely strain already overburdened HCF. How will we provide routine care to chronically ill patients while responding to a pandemic? Physicians and HCF need to prepare now and identify solutions in anticipation of an epidemic: H5N1, SARS, or other emerging pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="para0620">Although no cases of human avian influenza are reported in the United States, being alert for this or other emerging threats is good medical practice and may facilitate early intervention of other potentially dangerous illnesses imported through immigrants, visitors, or travelers. Concern about H5N1 provides opportunities to discuss with patients good respiratory hygiene practices and influenza vaccinations.</p><p id="para0625">If and, perhaps more reasonably, <italic>when</italic> the first human cases of avian influenza arrive in the United States, the primary care physician may be in the position to identify the index case, initiate proper antiviral treatment, and alert authorities, setting off a cascade of events including public health containment strategies.</p><p id="para0630">The healthcare community is concerned with its ability to handle a pandemic. The high case-fatality rate over 50% in selected countries of avian influenza H5N1 is worrisome.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The ability of H5N1 to rapidly overcome species barriers, sicken birds normally not overcome by avian influenza viruses, travel West quickly coupled with the propensity of influenza viruses to undergo genetic reassortment, adapt, and mutate, argue for this strain of avian influenza to be a likely candidate for the next human pandemic.</p><p id="para0635">Rapid diagnosis and early treatment are critical to containing and preventing an outbreak from becoming an epidemic of global proportions. All treatments must be given early in the course of illness. Of four antivirals known to treat influenza virus A infection, only two are potentially useful and commercially available at the present time as chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis against H5N1: Oseltamivir and Zanamivir.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The former has been approved for both indications, but resistance is emerging. Peramivir holds promise as a new neuraminidase inhibitor, but it is still in clinical trials. The recently approved avian influenza vaccine is not commercially available but is part of the US Government response stockpile. Continuing research is being conducted internationally to develop processes that facilitate quicker integration of current strains into vaccines especially if there is low concordance between circulating virus and available vaccines.</p><p id="para0640">Healthcare professionals are encouraged to remain aware of emerging global threats, coordinate with preparedness agencies within the community, obtain updates regularly, and provide appropriate counseling and preventive measures to patients, especially annual influenza vaccines. Whether diagnosing the index case in the United States or being called upon to perform under increasingly challenging circumstances in the face of an epidemic, the healthcare professional of the 21st century will face emerging infections, possible bioterrorism, and persistent nosocomial infections. As such, healthcare professionals have an important role in limiting the spread of an outbreak, and, moreover can contribute to local preparedness efforts, provide appropriate educational information and medical care to patients, and set the stage for recovery.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliography0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ligon</surname><given-names>B.L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Avian influenza virus H5N1: a review of its history and information regarding its potential to cause the next pandemic</article-title><source>Semin Pediatr Infect Dis</source><volume>16</volume><year>2005</year><fpage>326</fpage><lpage>335</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16210112</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McFee</surname><given-names>R.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bush</surname><given-names>L.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Boehm</surname><given-names>K.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Avian influenza: critical considerations for the primary care physician</article-title><source>Johns Hopkins Adv Stud Med</source><volume>6</volume><issue>10</issue><year>2006</year><fpage>431</fpage><lpage>440</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tuabenberger</surname><given-names>J.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Reid</surname><given-names>A.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lourens</surname><given-names>R.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Characterization of the 1918 influenza virus polymerase genes</article-title><source>Nature</source><volume>4437</volume><year>2005</year><fpage>889</fpage><lpage>893</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">CDC.
