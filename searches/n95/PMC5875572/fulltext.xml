Dialysis patients are prone to blood-borne infections transmitted through needles, transfusions, and dialysis catheters. Therefore, it is very important to establish infection control measures to prevent the transmission of pathogens in hemodialysis facilities. Unfortunately, no such infection control recommendations have been made available to hemodialysis facilities in Korea. Even a few international recommendations have not been readily applicable to hemodialysis facilities in Korea. Therefore, an expert group composed of nephrologists and infection control specialists drafted and developed the current clinical practice guidelines based on relevant practical issues.</p><p>The purpose of this report is to provide evidence-based guidance for dialysis physicians and nurses to prevent the transmission of infections and control infection sources in hemodialysis facilities. The target population covered by the current guidelines includes adult ESRD patients over 18 years old who are receiving hemodialysis therapy in dialysis units. The areas of infection control covered by these guidelines include standard precautions, isolation strategies, vascular access, water treatment, cleaning/ disinfecting/sterilizing, and vaccination.</p><p>As in the previous guidelines issued by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Korean Society of Healthcare-associated Infection Control and Prevention, each recommendation has been categorized as either Category I (strong recommendation) or Category II (weak recommendation) on the basis of evidence levels, benefits/risks, and clinical applicability in the medical field. The grade of recommendation was adjusted when the performance level of the recommendation was expected to be low even though the level of evidence was high. In addition, based on an external review, some recommendations that did not fully reflect the domestic medical situation and caused conflicts of interest were not graded, and have been classified as unresolved issues.</p><p>The guidelines recommended by the expert group on infection control (or by other sources) are listed and discussed below, after the 12 principles of infection control. The categories for each grade of recommendation are stated within parentheses and are defined in <xref rid="t1-krcp-37-008" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Recommendations</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Infection prevention and control program</p></list-item><list-item><p>Hand hygiene</p></list-item><list-item><p>Isolation strategies</p></list-item><list-item><p>Infection prevention during the dialysis procedure</p></list-item><list-item><p>Control of the source of blood-borne infections</p></list-item><list-item><p>Infection control for vascular access</p></list-item><list-item><p>Water treatment</p></list-item><list-item><p>Waste management</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sterilizing, disinfecting, and cleaning</p></list-item><list-item><p>Laundry care</p></list-item><list-item><p>Environmental control</p></list-item><list-item><p>Vaccination</p></list-item></list><sec><title>1.

Hand antisepsis can be performed in the absence of visible contamination, while hand washing should be performed when the hands are visibly soiled with contaminants. Wearing gloves cannot replace hand hygiene. Not only hemodialysis patients, but also their families and visitors, should perform hand hygiene in an appropriate manner before entering the hemodialysis room.</p></sec><sec><title>Hand hygiene in the hemodialysis process</title><p>For all vascular accesses, aseptic techniques should be used for cannulation and catheter manipulation. The following is an example of how and when to perform hand hygiene during the hemodialysis process. When there is a patient with a mature arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis, the employee should locate, inspect, and palpate the needle cannulation site after performing appropriate hand hygiene. After the inspection, hand hygiene should be performed before the preparation of the hemodialysis set and priming. When the hemodialysis machine is ready, the employee should perform hand hygiene before checking the vital signs of the patient. Then, the employee should perform hand hygiene and put on gloves before preparing the skin for cannulation. After performing the cannulation and connecting a hemodialysis line to the machine, the employee should put on gloves and perform hand hygiene. After cleaning the hemodialysis set and disposing the waste materials, the employee should perform hand hygiene. Throughout the hemodialysis process, the employee should perform additional hand hygiene before and after touching the patient or after touching equipment or items near the patient. After the hemodialysis treatment, the employee should perform hand hygiene before checking the vital signs of the patient. Hand hygiene should be performed before and after needle removal. Lastly, the employee should perform hand hygiene after removing the lines and cleaning up the hemodialysis area.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>3.

To minimize the exposure to and transmission of infections in hemodialysis units, each unit should implement infection prevention and control measures systematically based on standard, contact, droplet, or aerosol precautions. A standard precaution is a practice designed to prevent the transmission of an infection by contact with body fluids. The concept of a standard precaution is based on the principle that any blood, body fluid, secretion, or excretion from any patient may contain transmissible infectious agents; (IA). Standard precautions involve the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, face shields, gowns, and gloves [<xref rid="b6-krcp-37-008" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; (IB). In hemodialysis settings, the risk of exposure to blood and blood-borne pathogens is increased because the bloodstream is accessed during the dialysis session; therefore, more rigorous steps to protect personnel and patients from infection sources should be followed.</p></sec><sec><title>Basic principles of isolation according to the mode of transmission of the pathogen</title><p>The staff in the dialysis room or infection control division should consult with patients with confirmed infectious diseases to determine whether they can postpone hemodialysis during the quarantine period. If dialysis is inevitably required during the isolation period, then contact, droplet, or airborne precautions should be observed according to the mode of transmission of the pathogen. The detailed isolation methods and necessary items are listed in <xref rid="t2-krcp-37-008" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.

If a patient has a dialysis catheter, the catheter exit site should be examined for proper positioning and the absence of infection before the catheter is opened and accessed. If possible, it is recommended that two employees begin dialysis together [<xref rid="b7-krcp-37-008" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While one employee manipulates the catheter, the other can manipulate the dialysis machine to prevent bloodstream infection. After the cap is removed, the hub should be wiped with 2% chlorhexidine/70% alcohol or 10% povidone iodine. The catheter hub should be connected immediately to limit exposure to air [<xref rid="b7-krcp-37-008" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The lumen of the hemodialysis catheter should always be kept aseptic.

Due to the passive nature of dialysis therapy, hemodialysis patients can easily spread diseases through the narrow space between their beds. Therefore, appropriate infection control measures are very important to prevent the transmission of diseases in dialysis facilities.</p><p>Although these guidelines were created as recommendations for infection control in hemodialysis facilities based on a systematic literature review of as many articles and guidelines as possible, the research findings that could be used as evidence were very limited. We tried to overcome this limitation by consulting with experts in this field for internal and external review. However, it will be necessary to revise and update these guidelines based on future research and evidence. We hope that these guidelines will contribute to improved quality control and infection prevention in hemodialysis facilities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to sincerely thank the board members of the Korean Society of Nephrology, the Korean Society for Dialysis Therapy, the Korean Nephrology Nurses Association, and the Korean Society for Healthcare-associated Infection Control and Prevention, who reviewed these guidelines and provided their opinions and comments.
