Common dental therapies for these diseases include tooth restoration or extraction procedures, dental scaling, and endodontic therapy. The main source of aerosols during dental therapy is the patient&#x02019;s mouth, which can cause spread of microorganisms and affect the quality of dentistry environment [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Most dental procedures produce aerosols due to high-speed dental equipment usage or tooth scaling [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These aerosols can include bacteria such as <italic>Streptococcus spp</italic>., which has been detected in the air of the dental treatment room during dental therapy [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Even shortly following dental treatments, the dental treatment area retains a high concentration of airborne bacteria, which may spread to inactive dental treatment areas [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Infection control is critical to achieve healthy and effective dental treatments.</p><p>In addition to the routine use of standard barriers such as protective masks and gloves in the clinical setting, the universal use of pre-procedural rinses and high-volume evacuations is recommended to reduce infection risk [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. During dental treatment procedures, dentists and all dental staff may expose to bioaerosols [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and PMs [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Previous studies indicated that aerosols exposure was related to the risks of respiratory, liver, renal, and nervous systems dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, no study was evaluated the relationship between health effects of dental healthcare workers and aerosols exposure during dental treatment.</p><p>Few studies have assessed the size and concentration of particles produced by dentists during dental procedures such as tooth drilling. One study in the United States reported that dental procedures produced considerably more PM<sub>0.3&#x02013;0.5</sub> (particulate matter 0.3&#x02013;0.5 &#x003bc;m in size) (2.32&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>&#x02013;3.74&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> particles/m<sup>3</sup>) than those that were present in the background air (2.22&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> particles/m<sup>3</sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Others have reported higher PM concentrations during dental therapy procedures than during non-working periods (i.e., indoor background) [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Several steps can be taken to reduce aerosol contamination in the dental environment. First, the water line to dental chair equipment should be disinfected. Second, all dental treatment machines and instruments should be sterilized. Third, a valve and strainer should be installed in the treatment chair to prevent sucking reintegration infected liquid, aerosols, and PM. Personal protective equipment includes clothing, gloves, masks, and goggles, all of which are useful for infection control, may also be used [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The protective masks include surgical masks, N95 respirators, and surgical N95 respirators classified by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The surgical masks provide barrier protection against droplets, but do not prevent leakage around the edge of masks and then do not filter small airborne particles effectively [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The N95 respirators filter at least 95% of airborne particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 0.3-&#x003bc;m or above but are not resistant to oil particles.</p><p>Furthermore, patients can use mouthwash to disinfect the oral cavity prior to dental treatment, which can effectively reduce the spread and distribution of oral bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous studies have indicated that the use of rubber dams and high-power vacuum systems during treatment procedures may effectively reduce the concentration of aerosols [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A bench study also reported that using a conventional dental vacuum system (vacuum flow: 66 liters per minute, LPM) or high-volume evacuation system (vacuum flow: 360 LPM) during dental treatments can reduce fine and ultrafine particle concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Until recently, few studies have focused on the size and concentration of PMs produced by dental treatments. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the size and concentration of suspended particles produced during tooth drilling and grinding, as well as assess the efficiency of a central vacuum system and protective masks for limiting PM production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Tooth sample collection</title><p>The Human Trial Ethics Committee of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital approved the present study (IRB No: 201700408B0).

A close fit achieved with tape fittings along the edges of the mask and the bridge of the nose to ensure the mask fitted to the face completely. Two kinds of protective masks were used to compare the efficiency of PM removal via the central vacuum system and medical surgical masks (SafeMask&#x000ae; Surgical Tie-On Mask, Medicom, U.S.A.), as well as N95 masks (N95 Particulate Respirator-SH2950, San Huei, Taiwan).</p><p>This study detected the indoor background particle concentrations before starting the experiment of drilling and grinding the teeth. All teeth-drilling processes took two minutes and then collected air samples under the central vacuum system was open or closed combined with wearing personal medical masks conditions. The suction flow (28.5 LPM) of the central vacuum system was according to clinical practice. In this study, 20 teeth were drilled and a new grinding bur was used for each tooth. Particle size and concentration were assessed at the distance of 15 cm from the treated teeth, as was the efficiency of the central vacuum equipment and the protective masks for reducing levels of PMs.</p><p>A portable particle counter (model 1.109, Grimm Labortechnik Ltd., Ainring, Germany) was used to evaluate the size of particles produced by tooth drilling and grinding. This consisted of a 31&#x02013;degree size channel and monitored for particles between 0.265 &#x003bc;m and 34 &#x003bc;m in size (defined as total suspended particles, TSP). The recordings of the particle counter were taken every six seconds. The concentrations of PM<sub>&#x02265;0.5</sub> (aerodynamic diameter, da &#x02265; 0.5 &#x003bc;m), PM<sub>10</sub> (da &#x02264; 10 &#x003bc;m), PM<sub>2.5</sub> (da &#x02264; 2.5 &#x003bc;m), PM<sub>2.5&#x02013;10</sub> (2.5 &#x0003c; da &#x02264; 10 &#x003bc;m), and PM<sub>1</sub> (da &#x02264; 1 &#x003bc;m) were recorded. A hand-held Nano Analyzer (Nanotracer, Philips Aerasense, Eindhoven, NL), which measures 10&#x02013;300 nm (0.01&#x02013;0.3 &#x003bc;m) particles (PM<sub>0.01&#x02013;0.3</sub>), was also used to monitor changes in the concentration of nanoparticles. This study defined the nanoparticles sized 10&#x02013;300 nm as ultrafine particles. Moreover, the particle concentrations were measured inside (I) and outside (O) the masks with or without central vacuum system while drilling the teeth, and the I/O ratios were calculated in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Each experiment was repeated five times. This study used SPSS 22.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois) for statistical analyses and the significance level was set to 0.05.

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine the removal efficiency of particles of various sizes (PM<sub>&#x02265;0.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>1</sub>, and PM<sub>0.01&#x02013;0.3</sub>) with or without central vacuum during molar grinding.

Suspended particles may derive from sources beyond teeth, however, leading to even higher concentrations of PM in dental offices while tooth grinding is ongoing. Nanoparticles are also released during abrasive dental procedures such as reshaping and grinding of ceramics, metals, and polymer materials [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A recent U.S. study found that indoor particles in a dentistry clinic were mainly composed of 6500 nm in size particles, with ultrafine particles (&#x0003c; 100 nm in size) accounting for 67% of all particles present [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, a previous study reported that the breathing zone of both the dentist and patient included a high concentration of nanoparticles when composite resin grinding as ongoing [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that the particles produced by tooth drilling were almost entirely PM<sub>1</sub> particles. These fine particles may enter the respiratory system alveoli, penetrating deep into the lungs [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms underlying aerosol transfusion include inertial impaction, gravitational sedimentation, and Brownian diffusion. Inertial impaction primarily occurs among particles with a diameter larger than 6 &#x003bc;m. When air flows through the upper respiratory tract or airway bifurcation, abrupt directional changes may prevent larger particles from continuing to travel in the direction of airflow, thus depositing on the airway walls. The gravity sedimentation primarily occurs among 26 &#x003bc;m particles. When air flows into the small airway, a decreased airflow velocity, gravity, and sedimentation causes particles to stick to the airway walls. Brownian motion primarily affects particles less than 2 &#x003bc;m in diameter. When airflow velocity is low, irregular and random collisions occur between particles, turning them into alveolar sedimentation [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This suggests that high concentrations of PMs, produced by drilling and grinding of the teeth, as revealed by the present study, may pose a respiratory health risk to dental personnel.</p><p>The present study found that the central vacuum system led to approximately 36% reductions in aerosolized particles generated by drilling and grinding teeth. However, this system had no influence on the size or concentration of nanoparticles produced by tooth drilling and grinding. Another study reported that high-volume evacuation may reduce the concentration of aerosols during dental procedures [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a result which is inconsistent with those presented here. Further studies should evaluate the relationship between vacuum flow and changes of PM / bioaerosol concentrations to prevent hazardous exposure of medical personnel and patients.</p><p>We found no significant filtration efficiency differences between the two kinds of masks tested here in terms of detected PM size during grinding with or without a vacuum system. Furthermore, we found an average filtration efficiency of the medical surgical masks of only approximately 20%. However, the aerodynamic diameter of PM generated by tooth grinding was almost below 70 nm, per the ultrafine particle analyzer used here. Therefore, the N95 and medical surgical masks used here do not offer a sufficient protection efficiency to prevent nanoparticle passage of the airways. A previous study that assessed the dry residue weight and filter efficiency of two types of surgical face masks (1818 Tie-On surgical mask and 1942 FB fluid resistant molded surgical mask) and a personal respirator (1862 health care particulate respirator), and found that a certified personal respirator may be more effective in filtering efficiency than high-quality surgical masks [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Particles in a dental office may be generated by a number of instruments, including air-turbine handpieces, low-speed handpieces, ultrasonic scalers, bicarbonate polishers, and polishing cups, as well as drilling and air sprays inside the oral cavity [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Strong evidence suggests that these procedures result in particle concentrations above background levels [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A previous study revealed that the highest submicrometer particle concentrations detected during dental grinding were 16 times higher than indoor background concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Dental drilling procedures also produce higher concentrations of PM<sub>&#x0003c;0.5</sub> than PM<sub>&#x0003e;0.5</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Inhalation of these smaller particles may pose significant human health risks, especially when particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs [<xref rid="pone.0225644.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It deserves careful consideration to remove suspended particles during dental procedures by using effective vacuum system and select optimal high-level personal face masks for dentists and other medical staffs.</p><p>A limitation of the present study was that effectively quantifying the actual exposure of dental staff was difficult. However, we found that high PM<sub>1</sub> concentrations were detected when drilling and grinding teeth. The vacuum efficiency of the central vacuum system and the filtration efficiency offered by protective masks have limited efficacy. Therefore, some strategies would suggested preventing fine and ultrafine particles exposure, such as promoting awareness of occupational health and safety, increasing ventilation rates in the work area, using local exhaust ventilation, and wearing high-level personal protective equipment.</p><p>In conclusion, the particles produced by tooth drilling and grinding were almost entirely PM<sub>1</sub>. A significant difference was found in the concentration of fine particles with the use of a vacuum system but not in the concentration of ultrafine particles. No significant differences in I/O ratios for either of the two kinds of protective mask tested here were found in terms of measured particle diameters, with or without the use of a vacuum system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0225644.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0225644.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0225644.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">WHO (World Health Organization). 2019.
