    "The present outbreak of Ebola has health care professionals seeking guidance on isolation precautions for routine care and aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). The most recent guidelines state that during AGPs, health care professionals should wear respiratory protection at least as protective as a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified fit tested N95 filtering face piece respirator or higher; for example, a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). The present review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using a PAPR versus an N95 mask, and relates the experience of the Jewish General Hospital (Montreal, Quebec) of PAPR policy implementation. Training programs on proper donning and doffing of personal protective equipment and quality control systems need to be in place. Respiratory therapists are frontline during AGPs and need to be active in the decision making of the type of equipment chosen to protect them."
