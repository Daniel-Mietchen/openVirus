Blood specimens were collected from 87 household members and 332 social contacts of 23 H5N1 index cases for HPAI H5N1 serological testing by modified horse red-blood-cell hemagglutinin inhibition and microneutralization assays. All participants were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire to collect information about the use of personal protective equipment, illness symptoms, exposure to an H5N1 case during the infectious period, and poultry exposures. Two (2.3%) household contacts tested positive for HPAI H5N1 virus antibody, and all social contacts tested negative. Both seropositive cases had prolonged, unprotected, close contact with a different H5N1 index case, including days of bed-care or sleeping together during the index case&#x02019;s infectious period, and did not develop any illness. None of the 419 close contacts used appropriate personal protective equipment including 17% who reported providing bedside care or having physical contact with an H5N1 case for at least 12 hours. Our findings suggest that HPAI H5N1 viruses that circulated among poultry in mainland China from 2005&#x02013;2008 were not easily transmitted to close contacts of H5N1 cases.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), U.S. National Institutes of Health (Comprehensive International Program for Research on AIDS grant U19 AI51915, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx</ext-link>), and from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China (2004BA519A71 and 2006BAD06A02, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.most.gov.cn/">http://www.most.gov.cn/</ext-link>).

During November 2003 to 16 June 2013, 630 human cases confirmed with HPAI H5N1 virus infection, including 375 deaths (60%) had been reported from 15 countries <xref rid="pone.0071765-World2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Most H5N1 patients have experienced severe pneumonia that often progresses rapidly to the acute respiratory distress syndrome <xref rid="pone.0071765-Writing1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Surveillance for H5N1 cases has mostly focused on hospitalized pneumonia cases, but the denominator of cases of human infection with HPAI H5N1 viruses, including asymptomatic <xref rid="pone.0071765-Vong1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and mild illness <xref rid="pone.0071765-Oner1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071765-Kandun1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> is unknown.

No change in HPAI H5N1 virus antibody titer was found for these two close contacts after adsorption with human influenza A human influenza A (H1N1) and A (H3N2) viruses. Both seropositive individuals lived with H5N1 cases, yielding an HPAI H5N1 virus antibody seroprevalence of 2.3% (2/87, 95% confidence interval: 0.2%&#x02013;8.3%) among household contacts. Neither of these two contacts developed fever or any respiratory symptom during the post-exposure medical surveillance period.

A single serum specimen was collected from the child on day 63 after the last known exposure to the index case (her mother); this serum had a neutralizing antibody titer of 40 and an HI titer of 80. The child slept with her mother and had unprotected direct and close physical contact with her for 5 days from the mother&#x02019;s illness onset on 11 February 2006 to her hospital admission date. During this period, the mother experienced high fever and productive cough. In addition, four other household contacts and two social contacts of the index H5N1 case were also enrolled into this study. The four household contacts shared meals together with the index case for 5 days during the infectious period; however, none reported providing bedside care or direct physical contact with her. The two social contacts reported close contact (within one meter without physical contact) for&#x0003c;1 hour with the index case. All close contacts did not wear any protective equipment during their exposure to the index case. Poultry were raised in the backyard of the index case&#x02019;s household. Six days before the index case&#x02019;s illness onset, 13 chickens were found to be sick and later died quickly. The chickens were buried by the grandfather of the 4-year old seropositive child. There was no report of any direct contact between the seropositive case and the sick or dead chickens. All other close contacts were seronegative for HPAI H5N1 virus antibodies.</p><p>The second seropositive case was the 43-year old father of an H5N1 case (case-patient number: 21). A neutralizing antibody titer of 120 and an HI titer of 80 were detected in serum collected on Day 24 after the last exposure to his 22-year-old ill son. The father had close contact with his ill son for 9 days after the son&#x02019;s illness onset on 16 January 2008 until he died. The father provided unprotected bedside care when his son was sick with HPAI H5N1 virus infection. He did not report contact with any other ill persons. We also enrolled two other household contacts (the index case&#x02019;s mother and sister) and six social contacts, and all of them were seronegative for HPAI H5N1 virus antibodies. The index case&#x02019;s mother also cared for him for 9 days, and his younger sister cared for him for one day, but neither wore any protective equipment. Of six social contacts that visited with the index patient within one meter (without direct contact), five visited for less than one hour, but one contact (the case&#x02019;s uncle) was present in the home for 7 days. Three days before the index patient&#x02019; illness onset, chickens in the neighbor&#x02019;s household began to die and all were dead within three days. Five chickens in the index case&#x02019;s household began to die on two days after the index case&#x02019; illness onset and all were dead within two days. The father did not have direct or indirect contact with dead poultry.

Only three contacts had direct contact with case-patients&#x02019; respiratory or fecal secretions, but all were seronegative for HPAI H5N1 virus antibodies. Among all contacts, 71(17%) reported direct contact (provided bedside care or had physical contact) with H5N1 cases for at least 12 hours. None of the 419 contacts wore appropriate personal protective equipment when exposed to H5N1 cases during the case-patients&#x02019; infectious period, and only very few reported wearing a surgical mask (3%, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12), gloves (1%, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6), or gown (1%, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4).

Five contacts developed mild febrile respiratory illness, however, none tested positive for HPAI H5N1 virus antibodies by MN assay after a median 29 days following last exposure to the index cases.</p><p>None of the 419 close contacts received oseltamivir for chemoprophylaxis. However, close contacts of three H5N1 cases (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;72, 17%) were given other antivirals for chemoprophylaxis against influenza. This included 49 contacts of an H5N1 case that received moroxydine for 3 days (100 mg, by mouth, three times daily), 7 contacts of an H5N1 case that received rimantadine for 3 days (50 mg, by mouth, twice daily), and 16 contacts of an H5N1 case that received amantadine for 5 days (100 mg, by mouth, twice daily). None of the contacts who received any antiviral chemoprophylaxis tested positive by both HI and MN assays.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings suggest that HPAI H5N1 viruses that circulated among poultry in mainland China during 2005 to 2008 were not easily transmitted to or among humans. Among all 419 household and social contacts of H5N1 cases with at least a convalescent serum specimen, the seroprevalence of HPAI H5N1 virus antibodies was 0.48%, including 2.3% among 87 household contacts, and 0% among 332 social contacts. The two seropositive household contacts were asymptomatic. None of the 419 close contacts reported using appropriate personal protective equipment, and 17% reported providing bedside care or having physical contact with an H5N1 case for at least 12 hours.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with other published data on HPAI H5N1 viruses that circulated among poultry during the same periods <xref rid="pone.0071765-Cavailler1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0071765-Dejpichai1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In 2005&#x02013;2007, sero-epidemiological surveys reported 0&#x02013;3% seroprevalence of H5 antibodies in populations exposed to infected poultry and in poultry workers. Few seroprevalence data among household contacts have been published since 2004. One study conducted during the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak <xref rid="pone.0071765-Katz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> suggested a higher frequency of HPAI H5N1 virus transmission: 6 (12%) of 51 households contacts were seropositive, but none of 26 social contacts. Differences in these results may be attributable to variability in exposures, host factors, or differences in the adaptability of HPAI H5N1 viruses to humans <xref rid="pone.0071765-Neumann2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

However, most of these studies have assessed the potential for nosocomial transmission from H5N1 case-patients to healthcare workers, except for a very limited study in household and social contacts in China <xref rid="pone.0071765-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Due to the few seropositive cases identified, we were unable to study possible modes of transmission or risk factors for HPAI H5N1 virus infection. It has been suggested that HPAI H5N1 virus transmission to humans occurs through inhalation, ingestion, or nasal or conjunctival inoculation of material contaminated by HPAI H5N1 virus <xref rid="pone.0071765-Writing1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; however, in some cases, the source of exposure to HPAI H5N1 virus is unknown <xref rid="pone.0071765-Kandun2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071765-Sedyaningsih1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Although direct contact with infected sick or dead poultry is the most common risk factor <xref rid="pone.0071765-Writing1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, it is likely that inhalation of aerosolized HPAI H5N1 virus is the most likely mode of transmission to infected cases. Some studies have suggested that environmental exposures may also be a risk factor for HPAI H5N1 virus infection. Studies found that lack of indoor water sources was significantly associated with HPAI H5N1 virus infection in Vietnam <xref rid="pone.0071765-Dinh1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and in Thailand <xref rid="pone.0071765-Khuntirat1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and H5N1 viral RNA was frequently detected in dust, mud and soil samples collected at farms <xref rid="pone.0071765-Vong2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071765-Horm1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

Probable limited non-sustained human-to-human HPAI H5N1 virus transmission has been reported in several case clusters <xref rid="pone.0071765-Kandun1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071765-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071765-Ungchusak1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071765-World5" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Neither of the seropositive contacts reported direct contact with sick or dead poultry, or had visited a live poultry market, the main risk factors for HPAI H5N1 virus infection in China <xref rid="pone.0071765-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, both had documented prolonged, unprotected close exposure (i.e. days of providing care or sleeping together) with a symptomatic H5N1 index case, which may have resulted in human-to-human transmission of HPAI H5N1 virus. Since backyard poultry died at the homes of both seropositive contacts, and only a single convalescent serum specimen was collected from each seropositive contact, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of indirect poultry exposure or environmental exposures as the source of HPAI H5N1 virus transmission, either prior to or after the index cases&#x02019; illnesses.</p><p>Notably, both seropositive household contacts were blood-related family members of an H5N1 index case in the household. Nearly all clusters of H5N1 cases have occurred among blood-related family members, whether linked to a common poultry exposure or where limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission likely occurred <xref rid="pone.0071765-Kandun1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071765-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071765-Ungchusak1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071765-World5" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In one sero-epidemiological study of villagers exposed to poultry, three of seven HPAI H5N1 virus antibody seropositive individuals were blood-related children who lived in different households, and were either asymptomatic or experienced mild illness <xref rid="pone.0071765-Vong1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Our findings are consistent with observations in other study that have hypothesized a potential genetic susceptibility to HPAI H5N1 virus infection <xref rid="pone.0071765-Horby1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Further investigations exploring the potential for host genetic risk factors are needed.</p><p>Our study is subject to several limitations. Of the close contacts identified, 20% did not agree to participate in the study, and we did not enroll children younger than one year old. Paired sera were not available from all close contacts during the epidemiological investigations. It is possible that we may have missed detection of HPAI H5N1 virus antibodies for some patients with single serum specimens collected &#x0003c;21 days after the last known exposure to an H5N1 case. Nasopharyngeal or throat swab collection combined with serum sample collection among close contacts of H5N1 cases during an outbreak investigation is of paramount importance to assess the extent of transmission and denominator of infected persons among the exposed, to assess the modes of transmission, including the risk of human-to-human transmission, and to assess the spectrum of illness with HPAI H5N1 virus infection. However, without positive viral detection, conclusions based upon a single serum specimen (without a baseline serum specimen or a subsequent convalescent serum specimen to document sero-conversion) may be challenging if serum is collected too soon, or too long after the exposure occurred, as shown in a study of the kinetics of the HPI H5N1 virus neutralizing antibody response, including relatively lower titers in asymptomatic and mildly ill cases compared to severely ill and fatal cases <xref rid="pone.0071765-Buchy1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Strengths of our study are that we used two serologic assays to identify evidence of HPAI H5N1 virus infection as recommended by WHO, and we absorbed out cross-reactive antibodies to seasonal influenza A viruses to increase the likelihood of detecting antibodies to HPAI H5N1 virus. Nevertheless, in testing serum by MN assay from contacts that had HI titers below the screening cutoff to define a seropositive result (&#x02265;40), one child contact with an HI titer of 20 also had an MN titer of 40. While we did not consider this child to be seropositive by both serologic assays, this suggests that some asymptomatic or mildly ill children may not mount a robust antibody response to HPAI H5N1 virus infection, and that further data are needed to define the appropriate antibody thresholds to define seropositive results. Another possibility is that the MN assay detected neutralizing antibodies that do not interfere with sialic acid binding as measured by the HI assay.</p><p>For future sero-epidemiological investigations, we recommend a standardized approach for sero-epidemiological studies, similar to what was recently suggested for pandemic influenza: (1) systematic sero-epidemiologic investigations following identification of an index patient or an epizootic; (2) standardized data collection to allow pooled analyses worldwide; (3) detailed exposure history (timing and intensity of exposures); (4) standardized laboratory protocols for HI and MN assays, including cutoff titers to define seropositive results; and (5) IRB pre-clearance for all studies or following identification of an outbreak. Ideally, pre-approved protocols will facilitate investigations of and integrated analyses of cohorts of clusters in which human-to-human transmission likely occurred, including collection of monocytes to explore host genetic susceptibility factors. Furthermore, prospective serial collection of sera will allow for better understanding of the kinetics of the antibody response to HPAI H5N1 virus infection, including persons identified with asymptomatic, mild, and severe illness.</p><p>In conclusion, we found low seroprevalence of HPAI H5N1 virus antibodies among close contacts of H5N1 index cases. This suggests that during 2005&#x02013;2008, transmissibility of HPAI H5N1 viruses to and among exposed persons in China was low, even with prolonged, close unprotected exposure to symptomatic H5N1 cases. However, as H5N1 viruses continue to circulate and evolve, the risk of human-to-human transmission of H5N1 viruses is unpredictable and could increase in the future. Seroepidemiologic investigations among exposed individuals should be an ongoing monitoring tool to assess whether HPAI H5N1 viruses circulating among poultry may be adapting to transmit more efficiently to and among people <xref rid="pone.0071765-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071765-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The ongoing epizootic of HPAI H5N1 virus among poultry in mainland China and elsewhere represents an opportunity to fully assess the risk of poultry-to-human and human-to-human transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0071765.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0071765.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Cuiling Xu, Yan Gao, Hang Zhou, Leilei Li from China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xuesen Xing from Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Pengzhe Qin from Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xitai Li from Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for assisting in data collection.
