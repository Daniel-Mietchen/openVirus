We aimed to investigate the current infection control practices used in Australian and New Zealand (NZ) CF centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Two online surveys were distributed to Australian and NZ CF centers regarding the uptake of selected IP&#x00026;C recommendations. One survey was distributed to all the Medical Directors and Lead CF Nurses and the second survey was distributed to all the Lead CF Physiotherapists.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The response rate was 60% (60/100) for medical/nursing and 58% (14/24) for physiotherapy. Over 90% (55/60) of CF centers followed CF-specific infection control guidelines and consistent infection control practices were seen in most CF centers; 76% (41/54) had implemented segregation strategies for ambulatory care and no CF centers housed people with CF in shared inpatient accommodation. However, the application of contact precautions (wearing gloves and apron/gown) by healthcare professionals when reviewing a CF person was variable between CF center respondents but was most often used when seeing CF persons with MRSA infection in both ambulatory care and hospital admission (20/50, 40% and 42/45, 93% of CF centers, respectively). Mask wearing by people with CF was implemented into 61% (36/59) of centers. Hospital rooms were cleaned daily in 79% (37/47) of CF centers and the ambulatory care consult rooms were always cleaned between consults (49/49, 100%) and at the end of the clinic session (51/51, 100%); however the staff member tasked with cleaning changed with 37% (18/49) of CF centers responding that CF multidisciplinary team (MDT) members cleaned between patients whereas at the end of the clinic session, only 12% (6/51) of the CF MDT cleaned the consult room.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Overall, Australian and NZ CF centers have adopted many recommendations from the IP&#x00026;C. Although, the application of contact precautions was inconsistent and had overall a low level of adoption in CF centers. In ~&#x02009;25% of centers, mixed waiting areas occurred in the ambulatory care. Given the variability of responses, additional work is required to achieve greater consistency between centers.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cystic fibrosis</kwd><kwd>Infection control</kwd><kwd>Cross-infection</kwd><kwd>Contact precautions</kwd><kwd>Survey</kwd><kwd>Masks</kwd><kwd>Cleaning</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006501</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BELL14AO</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010230</institution-id><institution>Department of Health, Queensland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>50007</award-id><award-id>HRF Wainwright</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wainwright</surname><given-names>Claire Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Prince Charles Hospital Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>PhD scholarship - Stockwell</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008914</institution-id><institution>Advance Queensland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Scholarship - Stockwell</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">The Infection Recommendations for Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) were initially published in 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and recently updated as Infection Prevention and Control (IP&#x00026;C) Guideline for CF: 2013 Update [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] in response to the emerging evidence of CF respiratory pathogen transmission.

In a recent survey of US CF centers, half of the centers had adopted &#x02265;75% of the selected IP&#x00026;C recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While the two surveys (ours and the US) had differing approaches, the key message is that many of the Australian, New Zealand and US CF-centers have implemented infection control strategies based upon the published IP&#x00026;C recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The adoption of IP&#x00026;C recommendations surveyed in Australian and New Zealand CF centers were similar between center type (pediatric-treating vs adult-treating) and center size (&#x02264;200 patients vs &#x0003e;&#x02009;200 patients), which was similar to the results of the US survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Regional differences in the adoption of IP&#x00026;C recommendations were found in the US-based survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; however, we did not analyse the regional differences due to the very different healthcare models used between the two countries: Australia has 24 specialised CF centers that care for &#x0003e;&#x02009;3400 people with CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] whereas New Zealand has 27 specialised CF centers that care for ~&#x02009;500 people with CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Physical barriers were outlined in the current IP&#x00026;C to prevent cross-infection in CF centers such as the use of contact precautions and segregation of people with CF during hospital visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Contact precaution use was similar between CF center type when reviewing admitted and ambulatory care patients, yet an important finding was the overall low rates for the ambulatory care setting, and that this was greatest in the New Zealand based centers. One exception was that adult-treating CF center respondents applied contact precautions more often when reviewing all CF inpatients compared to their pediatric counterparts. The use of contact precautions in CF centers with &#x02264;200 patients was also more variable. Australian CF center respondents were more likely to follow contact precautions both when reviewing hospitalized and ambulatory care patients. However, reviewing CF inpatients with MRSA infection was an exception and contact precaution use was similar across the different locations; most likely due to established guidelines when caring for any inpatient with MRSA infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The smaller CF centers and New Zealand centers may not follow the application of contact precautions during ambulatory clinics due to a perceived view of low cross-infection risk; for example, one person with CF may attend an ambulatory clinic session. Overall, the use of contact precautions in Australian and New Zealand CF centers was less common compared to the rates in US CF centers which reported 90% of centers use contact precautions when reviewing all people with CF (inpatient and ambulatory care settings) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">The segregation of people with CF during hospital visits (both inpatient and ambulatory care settings) was adopted in the majority of Australian and New Zealand CF centers despite it being costly and logistically challenging. The use of single rooms with ensuites for inpatient accommodation was lower in Australian and New Zealand CF centers (~&#x02009;60%) compared with German CF centers where 81% of CF inpatients were accommodated in a single room with an adjacent bathroom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Most importantly, no CF center respondents in our study reported people with CF sharing inpatient rooms with another person with CF. Though in the ambulatory care setting, one-quarter of the CF center respondents continued to use shared waiting areas without formal segregation. Prior studies have demonstrated that enhanced cohort segregation has led to reduced rates of shared strain <italic>Pseudomonas&#x000a0;aeruginosa</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Our results highlight the potential opportunities for cross-infection in a proportion of CF centers using shared ambulatory care waiting areas.</p><p id="Par27">To prevent cross-infection in CF centers, face masks are recommended to be worn by people with CF to reduce dispersion of CF respiratory pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The majority (61%) of Australian and New Zealand CF center respondents had implemented a patient mask-wear policy. While this rate is similar to a recently published study of German CF centers where 60% supplied masks at the entrance to the ambulatory clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], a US study reported patient-mask wear adoption rates of 85% in inpatient and 87% in ambulatory settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The low adoption rates of patient-mask wear policies in Australian and New Zealand CF centers is surprising considering hospitals almost universally require people with respiratory illness symptoms to wear a surgical mask while in a hospital facility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, patient-mask wear policies have been a contentious issue in the CF community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which may point to variable uptake of mask wear in CF centers. For those respondents which had implemented a patient-mask wear policy, surgical masks were the most common form of source control used in Australian and New Zealand CF centers. While the IP&#x00026;C recommendations do not recommend that respirators be worn by people with CF as source control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], a small number (&#x0003c;&#x02009;10%) of Australian and New Zealand CF centers did use N95 masks as source control. The low uptake of N95 masks as source control is likely due to the poor comfort of N95 masks reported by people with CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The cleanliness of the hospital environment, frequency of cleaning such as daily cleaning of inpatient rooms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and cleaning of ambulatory care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] has been reported to reduce hospital cross-infections. The implementation of cleaning procedures into CF centers is recommended to prevent CF pathogen acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The majority of CF center respondents from Australia and New Zealand cleaned inpatient rooms on a daily basis and most CF centers cleaned ambulatory care consult rooms both between patients and at the end of the clinic session. In the US survey, more than three-quarters of the ambulatory care rooms were reported to be cleaned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] although the timing of the cleaning protocol (e.g. between patients, at the end of the day, etc) was not reported.</p><p id="Par29">Our study also surveyed CF physiotherapists about the uptake of the IP&#x00026;C recommendations especially the delivery of exercise sessions, an integral component of CF treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Physiotherapy respondents delivered gym-based exercise mostly as individual patient sessions. Furthermore, the gyms were cleaned between every patient and the physiotherapist was most often involved in the cleaning (either solely or in combination with other staff). Interestingly, one CF center respondent that the patient assisted with cleaning of the gym equipment and this supports the findings of an earlier study that reported engagement of people with CF may enhance patient adherence to infection control measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">The impact on people with CF and their families when implementing these enhanced IP&#x00026;C recommendations in CF centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] must also be considered. The most recent IP&#x00026;C guidelines included consultation with three parents of children with CF and an adult with CF along with CF healthcare experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While patient engagement in developing and implementing changes to IP&#x00026;C guidelines should remain a priority, the knowledge levels in the wider CF community can vary and ongoing education of the CF community should also be prioritised. Furthermore, the debate in the medical community around appropriate infection control measure to implement in CF centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and the lack of understanding of how CF respiratory pathogens are acquired can heighten anxiety in people with CF and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Some recommendations are accepted into the CF community despite the associated negative consequences. For example, segregation is supported in the CF community, although the psychosocial effects of segregating patients can be considerable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">There were a number of limitations to this study. Firstly, all survey questions were optional (including the identifying questions) to enhance honest survey responses which may have resulted in frank feedback about local infection control policies and practices. The same survey was sent to Center Directors&#x02019; and Lead Nurses&#x02019; with no identifier to differentiate which discipline responded (medical or nursing). Additionally, the site identifier was an optional question and the majority of medical/nursing respondents did not answer or did not provide sufficient details to identify the individual site. The bias due to responses from both parties on key outcomes is unknown as we cannot assume both parties responded for each CF center. Interpretation of results for center type or center size comparisons has thus always been in reference to the responses reported for each category. Secondly, only 60% of invited survey participants responded to the survey which may influence the generalisability of the survey results to all CF centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thirdly, Australian and New Zealand CF centers function with very different models of care and while care has been taken to remove these influencing factors, it is unable to be eliminated from the data collection, analysis, and interpretation and may have biased the survey results. Finally, the impact of implementing the IP&#x00026;C recommendations into CF centres on people with CF and their families has not been evaluated here and requires additional study, yet is an important aspect in effectively implementing the IP&#x00026;C recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par32">In conclusion, Australian and New Zealand CF centers who responded to this survey have readily adopted many of the IP&#x00026;C recommendations and established some consistent infection control strategies. However, the surveys identified areas of inconsistencies between CF centers (e.g., following contact precautions), and highlights opportunities for improvements. Ensuring the implementation of consistent IP&#x00026;C recommendations into CF centers is desirable, as this may reduce the risk of cross-infection between people with CF and will likely facilitate the transitioning of care to other CF centers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
