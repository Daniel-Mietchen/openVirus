Infectious camels with active naturally acquired MERS-CoV infection, were co-housed with the vaccinated camels at a ratio of 1:2 (infected:vaccinated); nasal discharge and virus titres were monitored for 14 days. Overall, the vaccination reduced virus shedding and nasal discharge (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0059 and p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0274, respectively). Antibody responses in seropositive camels were enhancedby the vaccine; these camels had a higher average age than seronegative. Older seronegative camels responded more strongly to vaccination than younger animals; and neutralising antibodies were detected in nasal swabs. Further work is required to optimise vaccine regimens for younger seronegative camels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Vaccines</kwd><kwd>Viral transmission</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 from a pneumonic patient who subsequently died in Saudi Arabia. Since its emergence, the virus has infected more than 2200 individuals in 27 countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Outbreaks occurred mainly in the Arabian Peninsula in large crowded hospitals with one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Although bats have been proposed as a possible natural reservoir of the virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, dromedary camels are the only confirmed animal host so far. More than half (54.9%) of human primary cases have reported contact with camels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and the index patient in the Korean outbreak travelled back from the Gulf countries where MERS-CoV is endemic and circulating in dromedary camels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Several studies of camels showed 74&#x02013;100% seroprevalence rates of MERS-CoV in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The mean seroprevalence was higher in older camels than juvenile ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, dromedary serum samples collected between 1983 and 2010 and archived in different countries in Africa and Arabia tested positive for MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies (nAbs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, a recent study in Saudi Arabia showed that 70% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;584) of dromedaries associated with confirmed human cases were seropositive with viral RNA being isolated from 12% of these dromedaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Importantly, sequencing the viral RNA from both patients and their camels confirmed genetic similarity in every paired case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, it seems clear that MERS-CoV has been circulating in dromedaries in Africa and Arabia for the past three decades and has been causing human infections since 2012. Unlike the Arabian countries, there have been no reports of human cases in Africa, which could be due to under-diagnosis or differences in camel husbandry practices. One study has recently demonstrated that the virus in Africa may be genetically and phenotypically distinct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">To date, there is no antiviral or vaccine to treat or prevent MERS-CoV in humans or camels. In camels, the MERS-CoV infection is mild, transient and does not require veterinary care. There is therefore little encouragement for camel owners to vaccinate their animals against MERS-CoV. However, there is an increasing body of evidence on asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic human cases amongst people who regularly have contact with camels, suggesting that these people may transmit the infection to the community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, successful vaccination of camels would reduce virus circulation in this animal host and thereby reduce human exposure, leading to a reduction in the number of human cases. In addition, developing a vaccine for humans and vaccinating humans at risk, such as camel keepers and health care workers, would further control the number of human infections and prevent the spread of the virus to the general population. The same vaccine may be developed for use in both camels and humans.</p><p id="Par4">The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein is the main target of most experimental MERS-CoV vaccines as it plays an integral role in viral entry and fusion with target cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. It consists of a receptor-binding domain (RBD)-containing S1 subunit that binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on target cells, and a S2 subunit which contains the fusion peptide involved in viral fusion with target cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Several vaccine candidates have been developed and tested in multiple animal models including mice, rabbits, non-human primates and dromedaries (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>). While many of these vaccines were designed based on full-length S protein, some others were targeting the S1 subunit or the RBD of the protein to focus the immune response on the critical neutralising epitopes to induce nAbs. Nonetheless, non-neutralising antibodies (Abs) could also aid in protection against MERS-CoV by inhibiting essential steps in viral replication such as virus-target cell fusion. Furthermore, it has been shown that nAbs alone could not confer sterilising immunity but could provide partial protection in camels probably due to several factors including waning of nAbs and genetic change of viral lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, developing a camel vaccine based on full-length S protein could potentially elicit more robust antibody and T cell response compared to shorter targets.</p><p id="Par5">We have developed a chimpanzee adenoviral vector based vaccine for MERS-CoV (ChAdOx1 MERS) that has now been tested in mouse models for immunogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and efficacy, demonstrating 100% efficacy after a single dose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. ChAdOx1 MERS was generated by inserting the full length of the spike gene, from a MERS-CoV isolate (Genbank accession number: KJ650098.1), into the genome of the replication deficient ChAdOx1 vector as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The ChAdOx1 viral vector of this vaccine is replication-deficient and has been assessed in different animal models, including dromedaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and in human clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of ChAdOx1 MERS in dromedaries that are either seropositive or seronegative for MERS-CoV. We also evaluated the age effect on vaccine immunogenicity in seronegative dromedary calves. We have for the first time utilised a natural infection model of challenge to evaluate MERS vaccine efficacy in camels in a &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; setting rather than a single exposure to MERS-CoV in a challenge experiment conducted within biocontainment facilities. This is also the first study to evaluate a MERS vaccine in dromedaries in endemic countries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Vaccination and challenge of dromedaries</title><p id="Par6">Twenty calves (10 seronegative and 10 seropositive) were divided into four groups (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5/group).

Interestingly, older seronegative calves (1&#x02013;2 years) responded to a single dose of the vaccine and elicited systemic and local nAbs. As the history of MERS-CoV exposure in these camels is not known, it is possible that older camels found here to be seronegative may have had some natural exposure to MERS-CoV but their Abs had then declined prior to their inclusion in the study as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, it is also possible that these seronegative calves were truly immune naive to MERS-CoV and that greater vaccine responsiveness occurs in older animals with a more mature immune system. It is very unlikely that maternal Abs play any part in the lack of vaccine responsiveness in younger calves because ChAdOx1 MERS is a viral vectored vaccine that does not express MERS S protein on the virion surface and so will not be affected by pre-existing Abs at the time of vaccination.</p><p id="Par18">Vaccination resulted in a statistically significant reduction in virus shedding after co-housing with infectious camels in both seropositive and seronegative camels. Whereas virus shedding was minimal from seropositive vaccinated camels, further optimisation is required to enhance protection in seronegative camels including the number of doses and route of immunisation. Indeed, assessing the ability of an MVA-vectored MERS-CoV vaccine to protect camels against contained MERS-CoV challenge required administering multiple doses by both intramuscular and intranasal routes to significantly reduce virus shedding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, protective effects of vaccine administered by either the intranasal or intramuscular route should be assessed. Of note, we show here that in older seronegative camels, nAbs in nasal secretions were induced after a single intramuscular vaccination of ChAdOx1 MERS, but cannot rule out the possibility that these camels had previously been exposed to MERS-CoV despite proving seronegative on entry to the study, and the effects of intramuscular boosting after initial mucosal priming may be different from intramuscular priming of truly MERS-naive camels. The mechanism of vaccine-mediated or naturally acquired protection against MERS-CoV in camels is not yet known and further work will be required to study T cell responses as well as the possible contribution of immunity to antigens other than the S protein. However, there is lack of commercially available dromedary antibodies against immune cell markers, making T cell immunity in camels difficult to assess appropriately.</p><p id="Par19">The &#x02018;natural challenge&#x02019; model employed here replicates closely the conditions found in camel herds, and results in high levels of virus exposure over many days. Infectious camels were not removed from the pen after co-housing to mimic natural conditions. Even under these stringent conditions one camel in group +V demonstrated complete absence of virus shedding, with two others (out of a total of 5) in the same group shedding extremely low levels of virus, indicating that high levels of protective immunity can be achieved. Importantly, this group had high level of nAbs that plateaued for a year, unlike the +C group that had decreasing nAb titres overtime. These results suggest that vaccinating seropositive camels with S-based vaccine could boost their pre-existing MERS-specific immunity and minimise viral shedding. Nonetheless, following single dose vaccination, virus shedding was reduced in both seropositive and seronegative camels, which would reduce the likelihood of transmission to other camels or humans.</p><p id="Par20">Previous work as well as ours have shown excellent correlation between pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Thus, it is expected that most nAbs detected by MERSpp neutralization assay bind to RBD or close to the binding site in a manner that blocks binding to the DPP4 cellular receptor, although the binding sites of nAbs detected in the pseudotyped virus neutralization assay have not been determined <italic>per se</italic>. Nonetheless, non-neutralising S-specific Abs could also interfere with MERS-CoV entry and fusion in a similar manner to stem-specific anti-influenza hemagglutinin Abs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, but this has not yet been assessed for MERS-CoV.

In the current study, we found that induction of S1-binding non-neutralising Abs alone is insufficient to reduce viral shedding and only the presence of nAbs can minimise virus excretion. Nonetheless, previous studies suggest that only presence of high levels on nAb titres may provide sterilising immunity in dromedaries as even seropositive camels could be re-infected as nAbs wane over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

Accordingly, prevention of transmission between camels whenever large groups of animals are present, such as a market, large herd, or festival, cannot be prevented by hygiene measures only; and vaccination of camels should be introduced to minimise transmission between camels, and to humans. This study also presents a significant correlation between in-house ELISA and commercially available ELISA kits although low level of antibodies in some samples were detected only by in-house ELISA, previous reports showed that commercial ELISA kits may have low sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Pens, camels, personnel, and infection control</title><p id="Par23">A camel research farm was set up 100&#x02009;km from Riyadh city, remote from urban areas, with double fences and a secured gate. Inside this farm, three metal pens were set up with 30&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> in size. Each pen is 150&#x02009;cm height and has an infection control entry and exit points 10&#x02009;m away from each other and from the pen. Two surveillance cameras were installed for each pen. Food and water troughs were placed inside each pen, where they can be filled from outside without entering the pens, supplementary file shows the farm layout. Nineteen seronegative camel calves (negative by ELISA), were sourced and purchased from Jouf province, north of Saudi Arabia, and transported for more than a 1000&#x02009;km, using disinfected lorries, to the research farm. Additional ten seropositive and MERS-CoV RT-PCR negative camel calves were purchased from a camel market in Riyadh. Ten seronegative and seropositive calves were used in the main study whereas the remaining nine seronegative calves were used in a small follow up study to determine the age effect. Additional ten actively MERS-CoV shedding/infected camels (positive by RT-PCR; Ct value below 30) were purchased from local markets and co-housed with the experimental calves in one pen to serve as a natural infection model of challenge. Overall, a separate pen was used for each of the two studies and the third pen was only briefly used to gather infectious viral shedding camels one day before the challenge. All camels were labelled with paint as well as digital microchips; these two labels were used for the samples to ensure accuracy.</p><p id="Par24">Pen keepers, veterinarians, and drivers were trained for infection control practices including fit-test for N95 masks. Each worker used their own specific N95 mask, overall white gown, goggles, head cover, shoe cover, all of which disposable and used once only. The team adhered to utilising the entry and exit point of each pen to ensure infection control; each pen, donning, and doffing area has biohazard waste container, sharp biohazard containers, 70% Ethanol spray and virucidal ANIOSpray (Laboratoires Anios, France) used by the workers. All staff involved in the study were also screened and confirmed MERS-CoV negative by ELISA and PCR prior to, during, and at the end of the study. Biowaste was collected daily and sent for incineration by the Saudi Gulf Environmental Protection Company (SEPCO). Clean sand from a nearby dunes area was used as pen floors, and new sand were added every 3 months. Pesticide was sprayed over the pen floors before starting the study or when new sand is added. The research farm and pens were monitored by surveillance camera to ensure strict adherence to infection control measures and to ensure camels are not exposed to any stray animals (e.g. fox, dogs). Some photographs of this study are included in the supplementary file.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Vaccine, vaccination and sample collection</title><p id="Par25">The ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine candidate and ChAdOx1-eGFP vector control were produced by the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, UK as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

In the camel control groups of our studies (groups &#x02212;C, +C, and AG01), camels were either immunised with ChAdOx1-eGFP (vector control) or PBS (placebo control). Blood samples were collected at different d.p.i. and transferred to the lab in portable refrigerators. For serum, 10&#x02009;ml blood from each camel was collected at each time point.

First, a mixed model for repeated measures design of the log-transformed MERS-CoV GE (TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) values was employed to account for the covariance among repeated measures and assess the change in virus titres over time. Virus titres in all animals (subjects) were measured daily (equally spaced time points), the within-subject association among the repeated measures is modelled by assuming a first-order autoregressive correlation structure matrix. The same analysis model was also applied on the nasal discharge scores collected over time (from 1 to 14 days post challenge).
