The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 59 million HCWs worldwide are potentially exposed to hazardous biological agents every day.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> When a disease can be transmitted through humans, as in the case of measles, vaccination is considered as the most important primary prevention strategy, with extended effect to HCWs&#x02019; colleagues and patients.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Measles is a highly infectious disease that can transmit measles virus to 75&#x02013;90% of susceptible contacts<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> with a reported higher risk among nonimmune HCWs compared to that of the general population.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Recently, outbreak events were reported, in Egypt and worldwide, characterized by the nosocomial transmission of measles with subsequent infection of HCWs.<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>World Health Organization (WHO) defined measles elimination as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a defined geographical area for at least 12 months. Meanwhile, eradication is defined as the worldwide interruption of measles virus transmission in the presence of a surveillance system that has been verified to be performing well.<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In 2015, Egypt endorsed the 2016&#x02013;2020 Eastern Mediterranean Vaccine Action Plan as a framework for the implementation of the Global Vaccine Action Plan in countries of the region. It included immediate measles elimination and interruption of endemic measles virus transmission, latest by 2020.<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Measures for measles containment action plan in hospital settings include early and accurate case diagnosis, prevention of infection transmission, and protection of HCWs and other hospital staff.<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Being the only reliable protection against the nosocomial spread of measles, especially for susceptible HCW, vaccination against measles is strongly recommended by international and national health authorities.<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Live attenuated measles vaccines, either monovalent vaccine or measles-containing vaccine in combination such as combined measles&#x02013;rubella vaccine, measles&#x02013;mumps&#x02013;rubella (MMR) vaccine, or measles&#x02013;mumps&#x02013;rubella&#x02013;varicella vaccine, induce lifelong immunity.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> At least 98% of those receiving two doses of MMR vaccine are protected against the disease.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Vaccine-induced antibody concentrations decrease over time and may become undetectable. However, immunological memory persists and, following exposure to measles virus, most vaccinated people produce a protective immune response.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Globally, measles immunization coverage has improved steadily since 1990, to reach 83% in 2008. The lowest rates were in the WHO South-East Asia (75%) and African (73%) regions<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Low measles vaccination coverage was reported in several studies.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a threshold of 95% immunization coverage to achieve so-called &#x0201c;herd immunity.&#x0201d; However, by the end of 2018, the global coverage of the first dose of the measles vaccine was reported at 86%, the second dose is much lower, at 67%. In the past 8 years, over 20 million children worldwide missed out on measles vaccine annually, creating a pathway to current global outbreaks especially in n low- and middle-income countries.<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Healthcare workers are often referred to be the most confided source of immunization-related data for their patients and associates. They are considered in the best position to understand hesitant patients and to find ways of explaining the benefits of vaccination. However, in some instances, healthcare workers themselves can be vaccine-hesitant, they even do not recommend the vaccine for their patients. Hence, HCWs should not only be vaccinated with a documented evidence of measles immunity, but they should also be encouraged to have an active role in measles control.<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Although the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) in Egypt has achieved several successes in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases with coverage of over 90%, challenges still exist with measles outbreaks occurring in 2013 and 2014, and the increasing need for continuous surveillance.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This study aimed to assess the HCWs&#x02019; measles immune status and its influencing factors; to measure their knowledge, attitude, and practice toward measles infection, potential exposure, and vaccination; and to identify factors predicting the vaccination status of the HCWs.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Study Design and Settings</title><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 10, 2018, to March 10, 2019, at the Pediatric Department of Zagazig University Hospital, Zagazig City, Egypt.

A significant variation was observed among HCWs about the mode of transmission. Although all of them were aware that measles is a contagious disease, the virus can spread from children to HCWs, can cause complications, and can be prevented by administering the vaccine, only 7.7% of HCWs were aware that measles virus could not be transmitted by food. Regarding the infectivity period, 69.2% of them thought the measles patient to be a source of infection of the offenders before the onset of rash, and 15.4% of HCWs considered the measles patient as not a source of infection for the offenders only after the emergence of skin rash.<table-wrap id="T0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Knowledge of HCWs Regarding Measles Infection and Vaccination</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables* (The Correct Answer)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Frequency (n=104)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measles is a contagious disease?

</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Discussion</title><p>Measles vaccination of healthcare workers is an efficient mean of prevention of nosocomial measles outbreaks and could contribute to eliminate measles in the general population. Adults over 20 years old have a higher risk of severe or fatal measles than adults less than 20 years old.<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> HCWs&#x02019; vaccination recommendations work better if they are focused on speci&#x0fb01;c HCWs&#x02019; groups and appropriate diseases such as measles.<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> As measles is a common childhood illness, the current study targeted HCWs at the pediatric hospital, the place where measles-infected children visit very frequently.</p><p>The measles vaccine is fundamental for susceptible HCWs as in recent years the epidemiology of these diseases has changed, involving a significant number of adults and elderly individuals instead of children.<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Little attention is paid by HCWs to the importance of receiving vaccination against measles. This was evident in a previous Egyptian study (32.8%).<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In a previous report, about 61.6% of Italian HCWs do not believe that the measles vaccine should be mandatory to HCWs. Fortunately, this study showed a significantly higher vaccination rate (76.9%). This might be attributed to the target group in the current study who works at the pediatric hospital with more readiness to protect themself from measles infection; a prevalent disease among children.</p><p>Susceptible HCWs who work in patient care are at high risk of becoming a source for disease transmission among patients.<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In the present study, testing seroprevalence IgG against measles among HCWs revealed that 6.7% were seronegative and hence were susceptible to measles infection. Measles vaccine unresponsiveness could be explained by host or vaccine-related factors. Actually, 2&#x02013;10% of individuals fail to raise antibody levels to routine vaccines. Immune and health status as well as genetic factors are important key players. Vaccine-related ones include inadequate attenuation, wrong route or interrupted schedule and interruption of cold chain.<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In Egypt, measles vaccine was introduced as a compulsory vaccine to children at the age of 9 months, in which the vaccine might interfere with maternal Abs. In response, this time has been changed later to be at 12 months.<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In the current study, only one participant showed a seronegative response, despite being vaccinated. When interviewed, he stated that he only received one dose of the vaccine and forgot the second one.</p><p>Disseminating data about the current vaccine non-responsiveness status supports the importance of complying with the recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation; the use of N95 or equivalent respirator for suspected measles cases regardless of the immunity status. This is because, in several instances, HCWs may be unaware of their immune status. Thus, they expose themselves to significant risk, and they mostly have a false sense of security when they deal with a suspected case.<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Comparing the characteristics of nonimmune HCWs with that of immune ones, the results showed that most of them, excluding medical doctors, are nonimmune. The junior ones and those who did not take measles prevention and control course showed the highest percentages of nonimmunity. This could be significantly helpful for hospital managers to select the target groups for any proposed vaccination campaigns. It emphasizes the importance of a preemployment and training assessment of immune status against measles. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports confirmed that proof/documentation of HCWs&#x02019; immunity or immunization to measles should be required as a pretraining and employment requirement.<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Good knowledge is associated with a positive attitude, which was evident in the present study. Participants&#x02019; knowledge about the routes of transmission is still insufficient, which was reflected in the improper practice and attitude toward patient isolation and protective clothing. All of the HCWs are well aware of the significance and effects of measles and the possible risk of acquiring the infection from their patients and vice versa. A finding was confirmed regarding their willingness to take training courses about prevention (61.0% are already trained, and the majority of the untrained HCWs are ready to take training courses). However, HCWs have insufficient knowledge regarding the infectivity period (15.4% only knows the right answer); hence, this should be taken into consideration in future training and educational session.</p><p>All participants are aware that the vaccine prevents measles; however, 82.7% know that it is recommended by the WHO for HCWs, and 61.5% only knows that it gives lifelong immunity. Approximately 86.5% have a positive attitude toward a compulsory vaccine for HCWs. Similar results were reported from other studies.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A previous study reported low immunization coverage among HCWs and attributed this finding to personal decisions and not immunization strategies.<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Vaccine hesitancy to measles vaccine could be related to false beliefs about the vaccine; some accused it of causing autism, measles and even death. An important other factor is the lack of knowledge and awareness of vaccine role in preventing measles outbreaks. Previous vaccination side effect (bad experience) is also considered another contributor to vaccine hesitancy. Most successful interventions are based on education and improving knowledge about vaccine safety, effectiveness, or the need for vaccines.<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that marital status and taking infection control training courses are statistically significant predicting factors influencing the measles vaccination status among the investigated HCWs.</p><p>Indeed, changing the vaccine safety message directed to HCWs to highlight the benefits they will gain from being vaccinated is urgently required to ensure a better vaccination rate in the near future. Although vaccination without screening is cost-effective, the costs should not be solely calculated upon the direct costs of vaccination procedure (vaccine price and administration cost). There are other aspects regarding the indirect costs of vaccination associated with lost work time and potential side effects of the vaccine and their consequent costs (medical care costs including healthcare provider visits, investigations and treatment).<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This could be helpful for the healthcare authorities to promote another appropriate message for the selected target groups, so they could achieve a better coverage for vaccination campaigns.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Good vaccination rate, good knowledge level, and positive attitude and practice are evident among HCWs with readiness to control measles spread in their hospital. However, collaborative efforts should be exerted to fill in the insufficient knowledge reflected on negative attitudes toward vaccine and control measures. A new articulated vaccine safety message should be directed to HCWs. National policies should be formulated to support the compulsory vaccination and immune status check before HCWs&#x02019; training and employment in healthcare facilities. Different HCWs&#x02019; groups should be targeted by future studies on a wider scale.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors dedicate their sincere appreciation to the participating HCWs for their cooperation and help in facilitating data collection.</p></ack><sec id="S0006" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>La Torre</surname>
