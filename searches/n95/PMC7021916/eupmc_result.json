    "Background:Healthcare workers (HCWs) should have an active role in measles control. Objective:This study aimed to assess the HCWs' measles immune status and its influencing factors; to measure their knowledge, attitude, and practice toward measles infection/vaccination; and to identify factors predicting their vaccination status. Methods:Data were collected using a semi-tailored questionnaire. Immunoglobulin G against measles was measured. Regression analysis for measles vaccination was performed. Results:Approximately 97 HCWs (93.3%) were seropositive, 79 (76.0%) were vaccinated, 18 (17.3%) were previously infected, and 9 (8.7%) were both vaccinated and previously infected. One previously vaccinated participant was seronegative. The immune status was associated with marital status, residence, work duration, infection control training, and wearing personal protective equipment. Positive attitudes and practices were reported. Marital status and infection control training were predictors for measles vaccination. Conclusion:HCWs showed readiness to control the spread of measles. National policies for compulsory HCWs' vaccination and immune status check before training and employment are required."
