Seto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>) performed a case study in five Hong Kong hospitals, involving 241 non-infected staff and 13 infected staff who were exposed to 11 patients with SARS, and they concluded that SARS was contagious by droplets. They suggested that the wearing of facemasks was of significance in reducing the risk of contagion after exposure to patients with SARS. Wong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2004</xref>) reported a study on effective personal protective clothing (PPC) for healthcare workers attending patients with SARS. In the World Health Organization (WHO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>) and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>) guidelines for PPE, facemasks with 95% filtration efficiency or above are required for healthcare workers exposed to SARS patients.</p><p>Hayashi and Tokura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>) found that it was important to prevent an excessive increase of microclimate temperature and humidity inside the facemask in order to reduce heat stress on the body when farmers were spraying pesticides in a warm environment. Farquharson and Baguley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>) reported that Emergency Department (ED) staff taking care of SARS patients at a hospital in Toronto wore double isolation gowns, a hair cap, an N95 facemask, a face shield and two pairs of gloves. ED staff had 12-h shift work while wearing N95 facemasks. Only one individual could take off his or her facemask at one time in an enclosed room. As soon as the staff had finished meals and drinks they had to wear the facemask again. Such situations made ED staff extremely stressed. Nielsen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1987</xref>) found that the facemask air temperature significantly influenced thermal sensations of the whole body. Meyer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1997</xref>) reported that the acceptable duration of wearing respiratory protective devices was about 1&#x000a0;h in a work environment with an air temperature of 18&#x000b0;C on average, and that the comfort sensation was reduced with increase of the air temperature. Similarly, White et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1991</xref>) found that the wearing of chemical protective clothing significantly reduced acceptable working time due to increased heat stress. These findings show clearly that serious heat stress occurs within the body when protective clothing is worn, which could cause workers to tire more easily and reduce their working time.</p><p>In a previous paper we reported that the N95 facemask had a filtration efficiency greater than 96% during wear, comparing surgical facemasks of 95% filtration efficiency (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>). Both N95 and surgical facemasks treated with nano-functional materials had significantly higher repellence to water, which can prevent droplets contaminated with viruses and bacteria from penetrating the facemasks by capillary actions during breathing cycles. Further, it has been shown that surgical facemasks treated with nano-functional materials have a significant ability to inactivate bacteria (Yao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>). It is important for one to know what impact the wearing of different types of facemasks has on heat stress and discomfort, as the filtration efficiency is similar between surgical and N95 facemasks, and whether the nano-functional treatment has an influence on heat stress and discomfort. In this paper, we report an experimental study on the effects of wearing different kinds of facemasks with and without nano-functional treatments on thermophysiological response and subjective perception of discomfort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subject</title><p>Ten healthy subjects, five men and five women, participated in the study, and their physical characteristics are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

After body mass had been measured, the subject wore a 100% cotton T-shirt, short pants and sports sandals. Sensors were attached to different areas with surgical tape. Following a rest for 30&#x000a0;min on a chair (R0), during which time the subject was required to drink 500&#x000a0;ml water, the subject voided the bladder completely and put on a facemask, randomly selected.

Nielsen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1987</xref>) observed that delivery of air with different temperatures into a facemask corresponded to the application of a local thermal stimulus to the skin surface around the mouth, nose and cheek. This local thermal stimulus also affected the heat exchange from the respiratory tract. In our investigation, microclimate temperature, humidity and skin temperature inside the facemask increased with the start of step exercise, which led to the different perceptions of humidity, heat and high breathing resistance among the subjects wearing the facemasks. High breathing resistance made it difficult for the subject to breathe and take in sufficient oxygen. Shortage of oxygen stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and increases heart rate (Ganong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1997</xref>). It was probable that the subjects felt unfit, fatigued and overall discomfort due to this reason. White et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1991</xref>) found that the increases in heart rate, skin temperature and subjective ratings may pose substantial additional stress to the wearer and might reduce work tolerance. This could be the reason why Farquharson reported that working 12-h shifts while wearing an N95 mask had indeed been a challenge to their ED staff (Farquharson and Baguley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>).</p><p>Significant differences were observed between N95 and surgical masks. Mean heart rate, microclimate temperature, humidity and skin temperature inside the facemask, together with perceived humidity, heat, breathing resistance in the facemask, and itchiness, fatigue and overall discomfort, were significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) higher for N95 masks than for surgical masks. In other words, the subjective perception of breathing difficulty and discomfort increased significantly with increasing thermal stress. This finding agrees with the observations reported by White et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1991</xref>). The surface temperature outside the facemask was lower, and the temperature in the facemask microclimate was significantly higher, for the N95 masks than for the surgical masks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), indicating that the heat loss from the respiratory tract is more difficult to endure in N95 masks, inducing higher heat stress and perception of discomfort. This agrees well with the observations reported by Hayashi and Tokura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>).</p><p>As the purpose of wearing the facemasks is to protect the wearers by filtering out viruses and bacteria, it is obviously questionable whether the surgical masks, which induce less heat stress and discomfort, can provide enough protection for healthcare workers. As reported previously, the in&#x000a0;vivo filtration efficiency and physical properties of the masks were investigated at the same time (Li et al., unpublished data). During the simulation wear trials, in&#x000a0;vivo filtration efficiency of N95 facemasks was 96%, in comparison with 95% for surgical facemasks. Furthermore, the surgical facemasks with significantly higher moisture permeability and air-permeability were thinner than the N95 facemasks, indicating that surgical facemasks should be more breathable and less humid and hot, which agrees with the in&#x000a0;vivo measurements of temperature and humidity inside and outside the masks and the subjects&#x02019; perception of breathing resistance and discomfort.</p><p>It is interesting to note that no significant difference was found between nano-treated and untreated facemasks for physiological measurements and subjective perceptions, even though nano-treated surgical and N95 facemasks were perceived to be slightly less uncomfortable. On the other hand, subjective preferences for the nano-treated surgical masks were significantly higher than those for the untreated surgical facemasks. This indicates that the nano-functional treatment of surgical and N95 facemasks does not have significant negative effects on the thermophysiological responses and subjective perceptions of discomfort.</p><p>Therefore, it can be concluded that N95 and surgical facemasks can induce significantly different temperatures and humidity in the microclimates of facemasks, which have profound influences on heart rate and thermal stress and subjective perception of discomfort.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our thanks to the Hong Kong Polytechnic University for supporting this research through projects A188, YD56 and G-YD80.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Farquharson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Baguley</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Responding to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak: lessons learned in a Toronto emergency department</article-title><source>J Emerg Nurs</source><year>2003</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>222</fpage><lpage>228</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1067/men.2003.109</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ganong</surname><given-names>WF</given-names></name></person-group><source>Review of Medical Physiology</source><year>1997</year><publisher-loc>Stamford</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Appleton and Lange</publisher-name><fpage>565</fpage><lpage>566</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hayashi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Tokura</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effects of two kinds of masks (with/without exhaust valve) on clothing microclimates inside the mask in participants wearing protective clothing for spraying pesticides</article-title><source>Int Arch Occup Environ Health</source><year>2004</year><volume>77</volume><fpage>73</fpage><lpage>78</lpage><?supplied-pmid 12955526?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12955526</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Li Y, Chung JWY, Wong TKS, Newton N, Hu JY, Guang YT, Guo YP, Yao L, Song QW (2004) In-vivo protective performance of facemasks coated with nano-functional materials.
