However, the mechanical, physiological, and immunopathological processes which drive the production of infectious aerosols by a diseased host remain poorly understood. Similarly, very little is known about the specific physiological, metabolic and morphological adaptations which enable pathogens such as <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) to exit the infected host, survive exposure to the external environment during airborne carriage, and adopt a form that is able to enter the respiratory tract of a new host, avoiding innate immune and physical defenses to establish a nascent infection. As a first step towards addressing these fundamental knowledge gaps which are central to any efforts to interrupt disease transmission, we developed and characterized a small personal clean room comprising an array of sampling devices which enable isolation and representative sampling of airborne particles and organic matter from tuberculosis (TB) patients. The complete unit, termed the Respiratory Aerosol Sampling Chamber (RASC), is instrumented to provide real-time information about the particulate output of a single patient, and to capture samples via a suite of particulate impingers, impactors and filters. Applying the RASC in a clinical setting, we demonstrate that a combination of molecular and microbiological assays, as well as imaging by fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy, can be applied to investigate the identity, viability, and morphology of isolated aerosolized particles. Importantly, from a preliminary panel of active TB patients, we observed the real-time production of large numbers of airborne particles including <italic>Mtb</italic>, as confirmed by microbiological culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping. Moreover, direct imaging of captured samples revealed the presence of multiple rod-like <italic>Mtb</italic> organisms whose physical dimensions suggested the capacity for travel deep into the alveolar spaces of the human lung.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work is funded by grants from the Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1116641), and the South African Medical Research Council (MRC) with funds from National Treasury under the Economic Competitiveness and Support Package (MRC-RFA-UFSP-01-2013/CCAMP) (RW CM TJS JB CI NM JW AM VS VM DFW); the Intramural Research Program of the NIAID, NIH (CEB); and Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation Investment ID 26123 (WAB CJC AJH CER).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>In pioneering experiments over half a century ago, Wells and Riley confirmed the airborne transmission of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, Wells proposed the concept of an infectious quantum, a unit of infection capable of causing disease in 68.3% of susceptible animals [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Key conclusions of these experiments&#x02014;in particular, that there are low numbers of infectious quanta and transmission is driven by a small subset of smear-positive patients&#x02014;have remained largely unchallenged. Subsequent data from similar animal studies appear to reinforce these findings [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], although the experimental formats may have been characterized by even lower sensitivities than the initial work of Wells and Riley owing to the need for higher levels of diluting ventilation in modern health facilities [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast, advances in molecular technology have enabled the detection of large numbers of <italic>Mtb</italic> DNA copies circulating in the air of TB treatment facilities [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, recent research [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] examining the exposure potentials of healthcare workers in a South African TB clinic demonstrated the utility of personal exposure sampling followed by PCR analysis as an effective tool to determine the risk of <italic>Mtb</italic> aerosol exposure. Importantly, these observations implicated the close proximity of health workers to patients&#x02014;which resulted in concentrated exposure over shorter distances&#x02014;as a possible reason for the inability of fixed-location aerosol sampling to detect aerosols in the same setting. Furthermore, the readily measureable breathing zone exposure described in this study strongly supports more extensive efforts to characterize the nature and sources of <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure and air transmission routes in different environments. Such knowledge is critical to inform the most robust mitigation recommendations for both occupational and residential settings; however it is heavily reliant on the development of practical tools to enable a more thorough understanding of the factors which determine <italic>Mtb</italic> particle production and transmission.</p><p>In clinical studies, there is a continued reliance on conventional bacteriology of sputum samples as a surrogate for infectiousness. Notwithstanding the practical benefits associated with a population that is easily sampled and analyzed, the dependence on sputum obscures critical uncertainties about the factors which ensure successful transmission of <italic>Mtb</italic> bacilli from one individual to another. These include the number of infectious particles produced, the number of bacilli within an infectious particle, the anatomical origin and composition of infective droplets, and the physiological adaptations which enable airborne transmission and viability of <italic>Mtb</italic>. Critically, for a disease which is driven by the host immune response [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], there is also incomplete knowledge about the mechanical, physiological, and immunopathological processes which underlie the production of infectious aerosols. Addressing these questions is not a simple undertaking, and requires the ability to observe in real time the release of <italic>Mtb</italic> particles by an infected patient, and to integrate this information within a complex dataset describing the host, bacterial, and environmental parameters which contribute to successful transfer of infecting bacilli to a new recipient. In other words, developing a systems biology of TB transmission.</p><p>Towards this end, we designed a small personal clean room in which airborne <italic>Mtb</italic> could be isolated in a clinical setting. Here, we detail the development and characterization of this Respiratory Aerosol Sampling Chamber (RASC), and present initial data suggesting its potential to accommodate newly diagnosed TB cases for enumeration and morphological characterization of <italic>Mtb</italic> particles. Our ultimate goal is to utilize this information to generate models predicting risks of TB exposure in specific environmental conditions, and to apply these models in developing practical interventions&#x02014;clinical, operational, and infrastructural&#x02014;to curb TB transmission in a region characterized by an elevated force of infection [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Approval for the human aspects of this research was obtained from the University of Cape Town Faculty of Health Sciences Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/REF: 680/2013).

The sealing door, incorporated a glass window for observation, could be opened externally as well as by subjects from inside the device. A small electric fan maintained internal air circulation (mixing), and temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels were continuously monitored (Thermo-Hygro-CO<sub>2</sub> monitor, MIC Meter Industry Co, Taiching, Taiwan). In the absence of air sampling or purging, the ventilation was determined as less than 0.1 ACH, and air-sampling rates during study protocols varied between 50&#x02013;200 liters per minute (l/min). The sampled air being removed from the RASC was replaced by HEPA filtered air while the discharge after the sampling systems was HEPA filtered and released into the room. Carbon dioxide, a natural tracer gas produced during normal respiration, was used to quantify the volume of expired air that was sampled during each procedure. A high-volume exhaust system enabled purging of the booth at 500 l/min via a high-flow HEPA filter which was used prior to the patient&#x02019;s exit from the RASC at the end of each study. Surface cleaning and inbuilt ultra-violet light irradiation were used to ensure equipment and surface sterilization, and to reduce cross contamination between studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Bioaerosol Characterization</title><p>The RASC was equipped with a suite of continuously operating particle sensors to characterize aerosols with a temporal response of a few seconds. Central to the real-time measurement of aerosol particle concentration and particle size distribution was an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS Model 3321, TSI, Shoreview, MN USA) and a Laser Scattering Particle Counter (Model 3016, Lighthouse Worldwide Solutions, Medford, Oregon USA). These two instruments worked in concert to characterize the aerosol particle environment in the RASC. The APS provided high-resolution aerodynamic (as opposed to physical) particle size distributions in the particle size range 0.7 &#x003bc;m to 20 &#x003bc;m. We assumed, based upon known deposition sites in the distal alveoli of the lungs, that the modal size of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected sputum droplets emitted by patients would be centered within this range. Therefore, the measure of aerodynamic sizing was expected to mimic the way aerosols are sized and transported through the human respiratory system. The laser scattering particle counter provided lower resolution measurement of physical particle size but was particularly useful for the study of submicron-sized particles with a minimum size of 0.3 &#x003bc;m. In general, the information obtained from the APS was considered more likely to be relevant to the predicted behavior of particles in the lungs; however, the correlation between measurements on the two instruments (APS and laser scattering particle counter) provided rich data on the bio-aerosols generated by the patient during occupation of the RASC.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Particle Sampling System</title><p>Our longer term goal is to utilize the RASC to define the morphological and molecular characteristics that might be key to transport of particles in the respiratory system and, in turn, determine the infectiveness of the pathogen. To this end, three main types of sample collectors were installed in the RASC, specifically: liquid impingers, physical impactors, and filters.</p><p>The liquid impingers (BioSampler, SKC, Eighty Four, PA) were set to sample at 12.5 l/min into liquid medium (PBS). Liquid impaction was included in the design of the RASC in order to enable the future use of FACS-based sorting of aerosolized <italic>Mtb</italic> bacilli from patients for downstream genotypic, phenotypic and infectivity characterizations, while solid impaction should additionally provide samples for whole-genome sequencing and mass spectrometry imaging to characterize the composition of airborne material collected on the impaction plates [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Two types of physical impactors were employed. A Dekati three-stage impactor (PM10 Impactor, Dekati, Kangasala, Finland) was set to sample at 30 l/min. The Dekati impactor was selected since it collects particles in three size ranges: for particles that have a density of 1 g.cm<sup>-3</sup>, the first stage collects particles &#x0003e;14.1 &#x003bc;m, the second stage collects particles in the 14.1 &#x003bc;m to 3.5 &#x003bc;m range, and the final stage collects particles in the 3.5 &#x003bc;m to 1.4 &#x003bc;m range. Therefore, this impactor was considered especially useful for imaging respired aerosol matter. A Six-stage Viable Andersen Cascade Impactor (Model 10830-EPD, Thermo Scientific, USA) was also employed since this device measures culturable particle counts as a function of particle size: each of the six stages captures smaller particles [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The airflow rate of the sampler was 28.3 l/min and the impaction plates comprised a thick coating of agar growth media to minimize bounce and enable microbial growth. Each of the impactor samplers was backed with a 0.4 &#x003bc;m filter to collect any particles that bypassed the impaction stages.</p><p>We also used two types of filter media to capture samples: micro-porous polycarbonate membranes and gel filters. The polycarbonate membrane filters (Sterlitech Corporation, WA USA) were nominally rated at 0.4 &#x003bc;m and provided high collection efficiencies when used in 47 mm open-faced filter holders, with flow rates through the filters usually around 28 l/min. The gel filters (Model 12602-37-ALK, Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) were 37 mm in diameter, and rated to capture &#x0003e;99.99% of both bacterial and viral particles. These filters were selected since the gel-filtering medium maintains moisture so that collected organisms can maintain significant viability.

For artificial release, fluorescent polystyrene latex (PSL) microspheres (Sigma-Aldrich Corp, St. Louis, MO and Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) were &#x0201c;dry&#x0201d; aerosolized into the chamber. The resulting size distribution graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146658.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) confirmed accurate calibration of the APS system for the three bead sizes: 0.5 &#x003bc;m, 1.0 &#x003bc;m, and 2.0 &#x003bc;m. Quantitative SEM methodology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146658.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) indicates that the actual bead sizes were 0.47 &#x003bc;m, 0.91 &#x003bc;m and 1.74 &#x003bc;m. After PSL beads were introduced into the RASC, they were observed by the APS within 6 seconds and were well mixed within 20 seconds of release. Analysis of the APS size-bins associated with the 2 &#x003bc;m beads indicated that the count of PSL beads relative to background clutter prior to release was approximately 50. This ratio was defined as the &#x0201c;signal to clutter ratio&#x0201d; and, for the 1 &#x003bc;m beads, the ratio was calculated as approximately 250.</p><p>For live aerosol release, we utilized a fluorescent reporter mutant of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> mc<sup>2</sup>155, since the non-pathogenic mycobacterial model organism is of equivalent size and morphology to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

The Andersen impactor comprised six stages, with different aerodynamic particle sizes captured on the solid 7H10 agar plate contained in each stage. The first plate (A1) collected the largest particles (&#x0003e;8 &#x003bc;m) and the last plate (A6) collected the smallest particles (&#x0003c; 1 &#x003bc;m). Each of the other plates had a collection size range between the two extremes. At the highest concentration range, the colonies growing under the jets of the Andersen device were too numerous to count individually with accuracy. In the bottom row, for the extremely dilute sample, a mean of 15 colonies were captured in the impactor giving a capture efficiency of 49.3% of expected CFU. As the protocol evolves, and more is known about the patient output, the sampling times for the impactor can be adjusted to be less sensitive (shorter sampling times) or more sensitive (longer sampling times).

Participants provided written informed consent prior to acceptance into the study.</p><p>Adult patients with a recent diagnosis of TB were recruited immediately prior to initiation of therapy. After entering the RASC, the sealed door was closed; the surgical mask removed, and a cough sputum sample provided. Following occupation of the RASC, carbon dioxide levels increased consistently, reaching levels of approximately 4,000 parts per million (ppm) above ambient levels owing to exhaled breath. Given that the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in exhaled air is close to 40,000 ppm, the target concentration of 4,000 ppm above ambient atmospheric level (typically ~400 ppm) indicated that approximately 10% of the air in RASC comprised expired air at that point. The typical time required for CO<sub>2</sub> levels to reach the target concentration was approximately 25 to 30 min. During this period, only the APS was set to sample from the chamber, at a rate of 5 l/min. Once the CO<sub>2</sub> level reached the 4,000 ppm target, sampling was initiated at approximately 50 l/min: the first 10 minutes were utilized for collection of bacteriology samples (Andersen impactor and gel filter), after which a further 10 minutes was allowed for imaging and molecular samples (PM10 impactor and polycarbonate filter). This 20 minute sampling period was expected to maintain CO<sub>2</sub> levels at approximately the target concentration. Finally, high flow sampling was initiated at 300 l/min for PCR samples, a 10 minute process in which the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was expected to return to background ambient levels. Details of the flows out of the RASC are given in <xref rid="pone.0146658.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

In contrast to prior studies which have focused on culture of aerosols created immediately following periods of forced coughing [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the RASC enables study of more aged airborne organisms that have been selected or adapted for environmental survival.</p><p>The RASC was developed to enable quantitation and characterization of the bio-aerosols emitted during normal breathing and coughing of TB patients in future clinical studies, and to incorporate the resulting information into a refined model of TB transmission. Critically, this long-term goal requires that the performance levels of the sampling sub-systems within the RASC be calibrated to ensure reproducibly robust bio-aerosol detection, quantification, and isolation. The results presented here suggest that the RASC is performing as intended and can be usefully applied in collecting and characterizing patient-generated aerosols, and for assessing changes in the nature and content of respired aerosols over time. The air mixing in the RASC is designed to replicate air currents that occur in normal indoor environments, and which decrease particle settling compared to still air. Information that can be acquired in the RASC therefore includes the number, size distribution (physical and aerodynamic), and morphology of aerosolized particles.</p><p>Infection of a new human host by <italic>Mtb</italic> depends on the generation of a source aerosol population that is defined both by the number of bacilli and the phenotypic and genomic characteristics of the organisms that are emitted from the infected individual into the environment. In addition, it is important to consider the evolution of the emitted particles as a function of particle size and morphological structure since these parameters alter how they travel and are transformed in the environment [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Particularly important in this context are the processes by which the aerosol particles dry (with environmentally variable kinetics) into derivative (smaller) particles of size and morphology that have been shown to promote travel deeper into alveolar spaces in the lungs of the recipient [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>We did demonstrate the novel ability to image individual airborne rod shaped organisms. However, we are currently unable to definitely identify these as Mycobacteria or other contaminating organisms. The general morphology of individual mycobacteria is a rod shape, approximately 0.2&#x02013;0.5&#x003bc;m in cross-sectional diameter and 1&#x02013;4&#x003bc;m in length [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, bacillary dimensions are known to vary according to whether observed in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or in TB cavities: organisms found in sputum and BAL are significantly longer, whereas the lengths of bacilli harvested in cavities are more reminiscent of stationary phase bacilli <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Under certain growth conditions, colonies can also appear in groups as elongated &#x0201c;cord&#x0201d; structures [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It seems plausible, therefore, that some proportion of the emitted aerosol produced by the infected donor may retain the elongated features of the microorganisms in the airways depending on the composition of the airway fluid in which they are ejected. This is also likely to be a function of the region of the lungs of origin, as it is known that the periphery is largely composed of surfactant whereas the ciliated airways possess mucus containing glycolipids and glycoproteins. The presence of inflammatory cells, immune mediators, and general debris associated with infection almost certainly contributes to a complex scenario which cannot easily be predicted and requires direct experimental evidence.</p><p>Once in air, drying of the aerosol will proceed at a rate dictated by ambient temperature and humidity (Appendix 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146658.s002">S2 File</xref>). The impact of exposure for individuals breathing nearby in either residential or occupational settings will therefore vary in both space and time, and must be heavily influenced by particle morphology at the time of inhalation. With regard to the influence of other key single particle features such as shape and agglomerate density, there are known phenotypes that might promote a rod shaped presentation (referred to as &#x0201c;cording&#x0201d; in Koch&#x02019;s original description of <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) that would further enhance the tendency for peripheral lung deposition [<xref rid="pone.0146658.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Our preliminary results suggest that RASC sampling has the potential to give qualitative information about particles and organisms which have been exhaled and remained airborne.
