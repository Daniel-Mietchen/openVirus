EID outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and Ebola virus disease (EVD), have shaped the course of human history and caused incalculable misery and death (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). This issue was highlighted by the 2014 EVD epidemic crisis in West Africa, a total of 28,646 confirmed cases with 11,323 deaths, which was an explicit example of unpreparedness of the public health system (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). In particular, the risk of acquisition of an EID during the care of a patient is significantly high for health care workers (HCWs) (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>). Although the HCWs did their best to control the recent EVD outbreaks, 852 HCWs were diagnosed with Ebola, and 492 of them died (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). The infection incidence among HCWs became 100 times higher than that of the general population (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). To prevent the transmission of EID spread in a workplace, HCWs are advised to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), including face masks, bioprotective suits, and medical gloves, according to the standard infection prevention and control guidance (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Although these PPE can significantly minimize the pathogen transmission, the risk of infection cannot be entirely eliminated (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). EID pathogens can be effectively captured and intercepted by the relevant protective materials; however, the sustained infection activity of the pathogen could easily cause cross-contamination and postinfection, which might lead to increased risk of pathogen spreading (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Alternatively, antimicrobial active protective technologies by incorporating biocidal agents into PPE materials could be another strategy to provide promising bioprotection against EID pathogens because direct contact killing is achieved (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>). Various biocides, such as triclosan, nisaplin, essential oils, peptide, chitosan, and silver nanoparticles, have recently been incorporated for bioprotective applications (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). However, their immediate biocidal effect usually suffers from significant decline due to the irreversible consumption of the biocides (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>). More effective, easy-to-use, field-deployable, and durable PPE materials to provide antimicrobial bioprotection from infection source to point-of-use are needed, particularly for the outdoor emergency medical services.</p><p>A systematic design of desired antimicrobial bioprotective materials requires an optimization of two important characteristics: the biocidal activity, as a capacity of the killing of microbial pathogens, and the renewability of the biocidal functions, which affects the durability and reusability in a long-term usage (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>). Rechargeable biocidal halamine materials have been developed and extensively investigated in recent years, and their functions can meet the basic requirements of bioprotection (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>). However, the use of a chlorine bleach solution as a recharging agent puts limitations on applications. Photo-induced antimicrobial materials, as the forefront of advanced and green materials, have high biocidal efficiency, ease of activity recharging, broad-spectrum biocides, long-term stability, high durability, and low toxicity with little environmental concern (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>). These materials would be, in this regard, a great promise as an exceptional candidate for constructing bioprotective equipment. Despite their outstanding potential, the major problem associated with the photoantimicrobial materials is their solely photo-driven biocidal character, with the instantaneous biocidal function fast decaying or quenching under dim light and dark conditions (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>). Moreover, most of these products were driven by high-energy ultraviolet (UV) light rather than the readily available daylight source (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><italic>28</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>), which are often energetically and operationally intensive, focused on specialized UV irradiation systems, thus significantly limiting the usability for bioprotection. Therefore, the challenge is to construct a daylight-driven, rechargeable, and antimicrobial material capable of working under both light and dark conditions, without compromising the interception performance against tiny pathogenic particles.</p><p>Here, we present a robust methodology to create daylight-driven rechargeable antibacterial and antiviral nanofibrous membranes (RNMs) by incorporating daylight-active chemicals that can effectively and efficiently produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). The photoactive RNMs can store the biocidal activity under light irradiation and readily release ROS to provide biocidal functions under dim light or dark conditions. The RNMs exhibit integrated properties of fast ROS production, ease of activity storing, long-term durability, high biocidal efficacy, robust breathability, and interception of fine particles. The incorporation of RNMs as a biocidal surface protective layer on protective equipment was demonstrated to achieve promising contact killing against pathogens either in aerosol or in liquid forms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Synthesis and biocidal functions of RNMs</title><p>We prepared the RNMs based on three criteria: (i) The membranes can effectively intercept pathogen particles via porous nanostructure, (ii) the membranes must become biocidal under daylight irradiation, and (iii) the membranes must be able to store the biocidal activity and readily release it under dark conditions. The first requirement was satisfied by using micro/nanotextured membranes with small pore sizes; ultrafine electrospun nanofibers were used as templates to achieve a breathable interception barrier. To satisfy the other two criteria (the formation of rechargeable biocidal functions), our molecular design is based on benzophenones and polyphenols, which are widely used as photosensitizers in biochemistry and organic synthesis (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>). The biocidal activity came from the generated ROS when they were exposed to light irradiation in the presence of oxygen (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> describes the synthesized structures. Two classes of benzophenone with different substitutes, 4-benzoylbenzoic acid (BA) and benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BD), and a natural polyphenol, chlorogenic acid (CA), were selected as the photobiocides to bring about the biocidal functions. Poly(vinyl alcohol-<italic>co</italic>-ethylene) (PVA-<italic>co</italic>-PE) was used as a polymer precursor and hydrogen donor to construct the nanofibrous networks (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). The fabrication began with a production of PVA-<italic>co</italic>-PE nanofibrous membranes in an average fiber diameter of 226 nm by electrospinning (fig. S1). Subsequently, grafting reactions were conducted by immersing the membranes in tetrahydrofuran solution with various photosensitizers, and the esterification reactions between the hydroxyl groups on the membrane with carboxyl groups of the agents were catalyzed by carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) (see details in figs. S2 to S5). Thereafter, the resulting membranes were washed with acetone and dried in vacuum to remove any residual solvents. The nanofibrous membranes modified by BA, BD, and CA were abbreviated as BA-RNM, BD-RNM, and CA-RNM, respectively. In anticipation that the combination of benzophenone and polyphenol moieties might bring in a synergistic effect in photoactivity, the BD-RNM was further grafted with CA to obtain BDCA-RNM samples (fig. S6). The representative field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of the relevant samples presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> revealed randomly oriented three-dimensional nonwoven morphology with fiber diameters in the range of 200 to 250 nm. Obvious adhesive was observed among nanofibers, which could be attributed to the superficial swell of nanofibers during the grafting reactions. Because of the simplicity of the modification process and the facile availability of electrospun nanofibers, great versatility in controlling the thickness and scaling up the synthesis is feasible. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> shows a typical BDCA-RNM with a thickness of 20 &#x003bc;m, and other samples with the thickness from 5 to 100 &#x003bc;m were readily prepared (fig. S7). A large-scale BDCA-RNM sample with a size of 40 &#x000d7; 40 cm<sup>2</sup> can also be prepared using a multi-needle spinning device (fig. S8).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Design, structure, and biocidal function of RNMs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structure of BA-RNM, BD-RNM, CA-RNM, and BDCA-RNM.

Once the pathogens are intercepted and in contact with the surface of the nanofibers, the grafted photobiocides could display an intrinsic biocidal activity as free chemicals; that is, in the presence of oxygen, various ROS, including hydroxyl radicals (&#x02022;OH), superoxide (&#x02022;O<sup>2&#x02212;</sup>), and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), are produced continuously under light irradiation. ROS could further rapidly damage DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in bacterial death and virus inactivation (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>). Our proposed mechanism of the photoactive and photo-storable biocidal functions is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> (E and F). The initial photoreaction hinges on the ability of the photoexcited RNM to access the triplet excited state (<sup>3</sup>RNM*) via intersystem crossing (ISC), which may be of local excitation or charge transfer character, depending on the relative configuration of the &#x003c0;* orbital. Thereafter, <sup>3</sup>RNM* can abstract a hydrogen atom from a hydrogen donor to form a quinone radical (RNMH&#x02022;). Under aerobic conditions, the RNMH&#x02022; would be trapped by oxygen molecules, going back to RNM and simultaneously yielding active ROS (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>). Meanwhile, if the generated RNMH&#x02022; was not fully quenched by oxygen, then a competing reaction, including structure rearrangement and a second hydrogen abstraction, could occur, leading to the formation of a metastable structure that stores the activity. This activity could readily release in the form of generating ROS, even under dark conditions. The detailed reactions related to the photoactive and photo-storage cycles are schematically presented in fig. S9.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Photoactivity of RNMs</title><p>To provide insight into the excitation features of the RNMs, we used time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations and diffuse reflection UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy to evaluate the nature of the initial photoexcitation event. The TD-DFT calculations of the RNMs (see details in table S1) predict that the lower energy <italic>S</italic><sub>0</sub> (ground state) &#x02192; <italic>S</italic><sub>1</sub> (lowest singlet excited state) excitations are negligible with very weak oscillator strength. Meanwhile, the <italic>S</italic><sub>0</sub> &#x02192; <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> excitations of the RNMs are predicted to be dominant, and the calculated maximum wavelength (&#x003bb;<sub>max</sub>) matched with the measured UV-vis spectra, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> (A to D). The &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> of BA-RNM, BD-RNM, CA-RNM, and BDCA-RNM were 275, 307, 336, and 332 nm, respectively. Although these &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> values were mainly located in the UV range, compared with the standard spectrum of D65 daylight, the light energy in the range from 300 to 450 nm can still be readily used by the RNMs, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>. The estimated daylight absorbance coefficients (<inline-formula><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="true">&#x0222b;</mml:mo><mml:mn>300</mml:mn><mml:mn>450</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mstyle><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">I</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x003bb;</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x003bb;</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="true">&#x0222b;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">I</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x003bb;</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x003bb;</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) for BA-RNM, BD-RNM, CA-RNM, and BDCA-RNM were 21.62, 35.33, 66.04, and 45.41%, respectively, indicating a robust utilization of daylight source. After initial photon absorption, fast relaxation via internal conversion results in thermalization of the excited electron from <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> to the <italic>S</italic><sub>1</sub>, followed by ISC to the <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> (lowest triplet excited state), where a series of photoreactions could originate (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>). Inspection of the frontier orbitals of <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> reveals qualitative differences in these RNMs. The BA-RNM and BD-RNM have similar <italic>n</italic><sub>HOMO</sub>-&#x003c0;<sub>LUMO</sub> transitions in <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>, with both <italic>n</italic> electron localized on carbonyl group and &#x003c0; electron localized over the entire conjugate system.

Moreover, by the combination of the benzophenone and the polyphenol, the <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> of BDCA-RNMs exhibits a unique charge transfer character with a <italic>n</italic><sub>HOMO</sub>-&#x003c0;<sub>LUMO+3</sub> transition (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>), where an electron occupying the HOMO orbital, which is an <italic>n</italic> orbital localized on the carbonyl group in benzophenone, is promoted into the spatially separated &#x003c0;*LUMO+3 localized on the conjugated system of CA.</p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Photoactivity and excitation features of the RNMs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> to <bold>D</bold>) Diffuse reflection UV-vis spectra of BA-RNM (A), BD-RNM (B), CA-RNM (C), and BDCA-RNM (D) along with theoretically assigned percentage contributions (&#x0003e;10%) of <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> orbitals; the acronyms of HOMO and LUMO stand for highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, respectively. &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> is the predicted maximum absorption wavelength. a.u., arbitrary units.

The relevant RNMs were subjected to a cyclic irradiation test with 20-min interval light-dark fatigue cycles. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> (F and G), generation of OH&#x02022; and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was mainly observed during irradiation and paused during dark periods, and the amount of ROS steadily increased after irradiation with no significant decrease in activity. The BD-RNM and BDCA-RNM exhibited robust photoactivity, whereas the BA-RNM and CA-RNM only showed poor ROS generation capacity. Significantly, the BDCA-RNMs exhibited the highest OH&#x02022; and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation capacities of 49.96 and 15.26 &#x003bc;g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, which were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of other daylight-driven photoactive materials (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>).</p><p>The photo-induced ROS generation cycle involves the hydrogen abstraction (RNMH&#x02022;/<sup>3</sup>RNM) by the triplet RNMs and a subsequent oxidation (RNM/RNMH&#x02022;) by oxygen. To provide insight into the mechanism of the photo-induced reaction, we used DFT to calculate the energy of the relevant reaction moieties (see details in table S2). We also quantified the reaction feasibility using Gibbs free energy change (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>, both BA-RNM and BD-RNM exhibited obvious negative &#x00394;<italic>G</italic> (RNM/RNMH&#x02022;) and &#x00394;<italic>G</italic> (RNMH&#x02022;/<sup>3</sup>RNM), revealing that the hydrogen abstraction and oxidation reactions were highly spontaneous. However, the poor daylight absorption ability of BA-RNM resulted in its weak photoactivity. In contrast, the CA-RNM showed significantly high &#x00394;<italic>G</italic> (RNM/RNMH&#x02022;) of 290 kJ mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> due to the inactive &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; triplet transition, which means that the hydrogen abstraction largely does not occur to form active radicals; thus, further ROS generation was also disabled despite the high excitation rate. Moreover, benefiting from the unique charge transfer feature of <italic>n</italic>-&#x003c0; transition, the BDCA-RNM exhibited high reactivity for both inter- and intramolecular photoreaction (see details in fig.

These results were further supported by the electrostatic potential (ESP)&#x02013;mapped electron density of the <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> and ground state of these RNMs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>, the <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> states of BA-RNM, BD-RNM, and BDCA-RNM exhibited obvious electron deficiency character on the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group compared with the ground state, implying the high tendency for hydrogen abstraction (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>). In contrast, a slight increase of ESP in carbonyl oxygen was observed for CA-RNM, resulting in the inactive <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> states. From these results, we propose that the photoactivity of the RNMs is dictated both by the light-absorbing capability (that is, the transition to singlet state) and by the character of the <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> triplet state (excitation configuration and structure of frontier orbital).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Rechargeable capability of RNMs</title><p>The properties of photoactive nanofibrous-structured RNMs can be further demonstrated by their promising rechargeable biocidal functions. We have indicated that the photoactive cycle consists of the excitation, hydrogen abstraction, and quenching by oxygen. However, if the generated RNMH&#x02022; was not fully quenched by oxygen or other organic burdens (for example, microbes), then other competing reactions related to activity storage could occur. To demonstrate this, we irradiated the relevant RNMs under daylight with increasing exposure time to 60 min and studied the photo-induced reaction and structure rearrangement with UV-vis spectroscopy and TD-DFT calculations, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> (A to D). The BA-RNM shows an obvious absorption peak shift from 262 to 252 nm, characteristic of the formation of reduced moieties in diphenylmethanol (DPM) form (fig. S11) (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>). Meanwhile, besides the DPM formation, a distinct absorption increase was observed at 420 nm for BD-RNM, indicating the formation of a metastable transient photoproduct that was previously referred as the light-absorbing transient (LAT) moieties (fig. S12) (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>). Similarly, the BDCA-RNM exhibited an even more distinct LAT formation without DPM transition. No visible change was recorded for CA-RNMs, which was due to the poor hydrogen abstraction ability. The formed DPM photoproduct was quite stable and was not able to go back to the original benzophenone statues (fig. S13). Meanwhile, the LAT moieties were proven to be oxygen-sensitive and can be readily quenched and reversed to benzophenone by reducing agents in the presence of oxygen (fig. S14), regenerating the photoactivity (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr"><italic>44</italic></xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>, the BDCA-RNM exhibited negligible DPM formation while having the maximum LAT transition ability, indicating that the activity-stored structure was able to recover with rare functional decaying. To quantify the ROS rechargeable capability, we first charged the relevant RNMs by 1 hour of daylight irradiation and then measured the releasing activity under dark conditions in terms of the amount of OH&#x02022; and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> (G and H), in contrast to the gradual ROS generation in irradiation tests, the RNMs rapidly released more than 90% of ROS in the first 5 min, and after that, the releasing ability shows a saturation region with ROS amount increasing slowly. As expected, the BDCA-RNM exhibited the highest recharging capacity, with OH&#x02022; and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> releasing amounts of 2332 and 670 &#x003bc;g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> by 1 hour of daylight charging, corresponding to the charging rates of 38.86 and 11.16 &#x003bc;g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, which means that the light energy was largely used with more than 70% conversion efficiency compared to the irradiation tests. Moreover, the recharging cyclic test of BDCA-RNM was performed as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>. For each cycle, the BDCA-RNM samples were first irradiated for 1 hour and were fully quenched with an excess amount of a thiosulfate solution. No significant decrease in the recharging capacity was observed for BDCA-RNM after seven cyclic tests; they retained more than 75% of the original charging amount of OH&#x02022; and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The nanofibrous architecture was also well maintained during the seven cycles of recharging, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>. The slight decrease of the capacity could be attributed to the accumulative consumption of the nonrenewable tertiary hydrogen in the PVE-<italic>co</italic>-PE nanofiber matrix (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>). In addition, stability for long-time storage of the LAT structure is another practical concern for recharging performance. The decay of the LAT structure occurred notably on the existence of oxygen and reductive organic matter, which could lead to a quick release of ROS. Therefore, if the RNMs were stored under a dry and closed condition, then the absorption peak associated with the LAT structure should exhibit slow decays, which can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>. A storage test over 30-day measurements revealed that the BDCA-RNM still retained more than 55% of the original LAT structure, highlighting the structural stability.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Contact killing against bacteria and virus</title><p>To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the RNMs, we challenged the membrane surface with two typical pathogenic bacteria, Gram-negative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 and Gram-positive <italic>Listeria innocua</italic>. For the contact-killing assay, the control (pristine PVA-<italic>co</italic>-PE nanofibrous membranes) and BDCA-RNM samples with a size of 2 &#x000d7; 2 cm<sup>2</sup> were loaded with 10 &#x003bc;l of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) of a bacterial suspension (2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFU cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), and the bacterial proliferation was assessed by agar plate counting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> depicts the time-dependent antibacterial effect of the BDCA-RNM under daylight irradiation conditions. It was found that the control samples showed significant bacterial growth during incubation even after 1 hour of irradiation. In contrast, the BDCA-RNM showed effective killing of bacteria, achieving 6 log CFU reduction of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. innocua</italic> in 60- and 30-min daylight irradiation, respectively, which corresponds to a promising contact-killing efficacy of 99.9999%. In comparison, a contact time of 5 to 10 hours is typical for previous photoactive hydrogels to achieve these bacterial reductions (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><italic>45</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr"><italic>46</italic></xref>), and other photoactive fibrous materials exhibit only up to 4 log CFU reduction but require a contact time of several hours (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><italic>28</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr"><italic>47</italic></xref>). Moreover, in marked contrast to the traditional photoantimicrobial materials, the BDCA-RNM can store the biocidal activity and kill bacteria under dark conditions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>. After 1 hour of daylight exposure, the charged BDCA-RNM exhibited 6 log CFU reduction of both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. innocua</italic> within 120-min contact under dark conditions, which nearly maintained half of the biocidal efficiency compared with the conditions of under lighting. Considering that the HCWs are easy to experience dim light or dark working conditions, this rechargeable biocidal performance is very promising on PPE from the viewpoint of practical bioprotection, serving the biocidal function &#x0201c;always online.&#x0201d; In addition, the rechargeable feature is also responsible for the renewed cyclic performance of the RNMs against microorganisms. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> (C and D), the five cyclic contact-killing tests revealed that the biocidal efficacy was nearly constant with 6 log CFU reduction of the bacteria, no matter with or without light exposure, highlighting the biocidal character of the BDCA-RNMs.</p><fig id="F4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Antibacterial and antiviral properties of BDCA-RNM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Bactericidal activity against <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. innocua</italic> of BDCA-RNM under daylight irradiation (A) and charged BDCA-RNM under dark conditions (B).

In sharp contrast, cellular deformation and surface collapse were found on the bacterial cells after exposure to the BDCA-RNM after 1 hour of light exposure. Most of the cells were lysed, and numerous small portions of debris were observed. This observation was also supported by the live/dead bacterial fluorescence staining assays. The bacteria in contact with the control and BDCA-RNM were washed out and first stained with a cell-nonpermeant propidium iodide (PI) red dye, which is only able to penetrate cells with compromised membranes, and then, they were counterstained with a cell-permeant SYBR Green (SG) dye, which can stain the nucleic acids of both intact and permeabilized cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> (I to L), numerous live <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. innocua</italic> were observed in green color after contacting the control samples, whereas little red color was found. In contrast, upon 1-hour contact with the BDCA-RNM under light conditions, the observed green fluorescence signals were significantly decreased, and all cells in green color were almost exclusively in red color as well, revealing that most of bacterial cells were disrupted or lysed without any integrated morphology. To further assess the damage induced on bacterial cell membranes, we detected leakage of nucleic acids and proteins from the bacterial cells after contacting with BDCA-RNM samples. Supernatants of pelleted culture were analyzed for spectrophotometric absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm, which corresponded to the characteristic peaks of nucleic acids and proteins, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> (M and N), nearly no organic matter was detected from the supernatant after contacting with the control samples. Meanwhile, significant leakage of nucleic acids and proteins was observed for the <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. innocua</italic> after contacting with BDCA-RNM, either under light exposure or under dark conditions, confirming the disruption of the bacterial cell walls and membranes. These results suggested that the bactericidal function of the BDCA-RNMs should be similar to that of peroxide disinfectants commonly used in medical sterilization, which involve bacterial cell wall and membrane disruption (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr"><italic>48</italic></xref>). Moreover, contact killing and free ROS release are both possible mechanisms, but the contact killing plays a dominant role for the RNMs. Because the ROS radicals have a quite short lifetime of &#x0003c;10 &#x003bc;s with negligible migration distance, the stable H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was not able to reach the critical biological activity level in such a short time (&#x0003c;10 min) (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>). Therefore, the use of the RNMs is advantageous to avoid the undesirable free ROS release and accumulation by using ROS smartly, effectively, and safely.</p><p>Antiviral function, killing or inactivating viruses, is another essential requirement for bioprotective PPE materials, especially for the increasingly viral outbreaks that the public is facing today. To evaluate the antiviral performance of the RNMs, we tested the membrane surface with T7 bacteriophage and evaluated the viral activity by <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02013;based stationary phase plating assay. T7 phage is a nonenveloped double-stranded DNA virus and has a single proteinaceous capsid, which has been shown to be less sensitive to photodynamic destruction than enveloped or RNA-based viruses (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr"><italic>48</italic></xref>). Therefore, T7 phage is an appropriate viral model to test the reduction of viruses by contact with the RNMs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> (O and P), nearly no contact killing was observed on the control samples, and the harvested phages could grow and proliferate freely on the <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02013;based culture medium. In contrast, the BDCA-RNM showed rapid and effective killing of T7 phage, achieving 5 log of PFU (plaque-forming units) reduction even in 5-min contact under daylight exposure. The charged BDCA-RNM also achieved 5 log of PFU reduction within 30 min of contact under dark conditions. The fast and highly effective biocidal activities were significantly superior to the previously reported photo-induced antiviral materials (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr"><italic>49</italic></xref>). Moreover, compared with the above bacterial-killing results, the virus has shown more susceptibility to the photoactive RNM samples. This is because the ROS might easily cause cross-linking of capsid proteins in viruses, resulting in a direct impairment of the capability to bind to the host surface (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr"><italic>48</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr"><italic>50</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Bioprotection application of RNMs</title><p>With the above results in mind, we further demonstrated the utilization of BDCA-RNM as a biocidal surface function layer for bioprotection applications. To facilely integrate it to current PPE materials, we investigated the interception properties of the BDCA-RNM against ultrafine particles. We carried out the filtration performance evaluation by using the polydisperse sodium chloride (NaCl) particles with a diameter of 300 to 500 nm under increasing airflow. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, by increasing the airflow from 10 to 90 liter min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the filtration efficiency of the BDCA-RNMs exhibited a very slight decrease from 99.98 to 99.07%, which was distinctly higher than that of the N95 facial mask (95%), widely used by HCWs. Meanwhile, the pressure drops showed an increased trend directly proportional to the airflow, indicating a cellular-dominated permeation behavior similar to that of the open-cell porous structure (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr"><italic>51</italic></xref>). Significantly, the maximum pressure drop of the BDCA-RNM was 128 Pa at 90 liter min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which was only a third of the pressure drop standard of the N95 facemask (350 Pa at 85 liter min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>), highlighting the robust breathability of the nanofibrous structure. The promising filtration efficiency was also confirmed by SEM observations; from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, we can see that abundant particles were captured on the top surface of the BDCA-RNM, whereas no particles were observed on the bottom surface, and the membranes also well maintain their structural integrity during the filtration process with high airflow. To further visually evaluate the filtration capacity, we estimated the filtration quality factor (QF) of BDCA-RNM with different basis weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). The BDCA-RNM with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of the basis weight exhibited the comparable QF values with current commercialized filtration materials, indicating the promising potential for protective applications (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr"><italic>51</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr"><italic>52</italic></xref>).</p><fig id="F5" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Bioprotection performance of BDCA-RNMs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Filtration efficiency and pressure drop of BDCA-RNM as a function of airflow.

After standing for 30 min, the population of the living bacteria on the three representative areas&#x02014;control area, BDCA-RNM area, and the covered area&#x02014;were harvested and measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).

Similarly, the charged BDCA can also bring about promising bioprotection against the model virus to the typical protective suit, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> (G to I).

Considering the ease of scalable synthesis of electrospun nanofibers from various materials, this discovery will thus pave the way for new types of nanofiber-based RNMs made of polyurethane, polyamide, polyester, and polysulfone, which might open more windows for use in various protective applications. Biocompatible nanofibrous membranes [such as poly(lactic acid) and polycaprolactone] could also be used for RNMs fabrication, which might satisfy a stricter requirement for wound dressing. Moreover, the basic mechanism of the photoactive and photo-storable functions of RNMs was demonstrated; thus, we can expect that, similar to the selected benzophenones and polyphenols, a variety of other photosensitizers could be involved in RNMs synthesis, especially those natural, sustainable, and biocompatible chemicals such as plant phenols, flavonoid, alkaloid, carotenoid, and riboflavins. We thus can use computational modeling to discover even more efficient photosensitizers to design novel and green RNMs based on our proposed rules. Furthermore, by future combining biocompatible nanofiber matrix and photobiocides, the RNMs would open broad technological implications for tissue engineering, photodynamic therapy, bioactuators, medical therapy equipment, and smart wearable devices.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated a synergistic assembly strategy for the scalable fabrication of daylight-driven rechargeable antibacterial and antiviral materials through the combination of electrospun nanofibers and the daylight-active photosensitizers.

With their fast ROS production, ease of activity storing, long-term durability, and high biocidal efficacy, the RNMs can rapidly and effectively kill bacteria and viruses, either under light exposure or under dark conditions. We also demonstrated the incorporation of RNMs as a biocidal surface protective layer on protective equipment to achieve robust bioprotection against pathogens either in aerosol or in liquid forms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Materials</title><p>PVA-<italic>co</italic>-PE (ethylene content of 27 mol %), BA, 3,3&#x02032;,4,4&#x02032;-benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPTCD), CDI, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, acetone, chloroform, isopropanol, CDI, polyphosphoric acid (PPA), 25 weight % (wt %) glutaraldehyde solution, 37% formaldehyde solution, 4 wt % osmium tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>), potassium iodide, sodium hydroxide, ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, potassium hydrogen phthalate, PI, and SG dye were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. <italic>p</italic>-Nitrosodimethylaniline (<italic>p</italic>-NDA), CA, Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, LB agar, Tryptic soy broth, and Tryptic soy agar (TSA) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Ten milliliters of LB broth was inoculated with a colony of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 and grown at 37&#x000b0;C at 150 rpm. A bacterial culture with an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4 (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> CFU ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, as assessed by plate count) was used for further experiments.

After 4 hours of incubation, 2.5 ml of chloroform was added to the solution and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min with moderate shaking to lyse the remaining bacteria. Then, the solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm to remove any bacterial debris. The supernatant containing the phages was decanted and chilled on ice overnight at 4&#x000b0;C before centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min.

After staining for 20 min, the bacteria were washed with PBS and rediluted in PBS. Then, the suspension was spotted on a microscope slide and examined using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000). For the SEM imaging, the bacterial suspension was fixed in PBS solution containing 1 wt % of glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde for 1 hour, and then, the bacteria were rinsed with DI water three times, followed by treating with 1% of OsO<sub>4</sub> solution for 20 min. Bacterial samples were then dehydrated by a sequential ethanol/water mixtures with an increasing ethanol content of 25, 50, 75, 90, and 100%, respectively.
