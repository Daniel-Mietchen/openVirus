Salbutamol (&#x003b2;2&#x02010;adrenergic agonist) is effective in a cohort of human patients with congenital myasthenia, namely in those with specific gene mutations resulting in disruption of postsynaptic structure.</p><p>We investigated whether adding salbutamol to pyridostigmine would prevent apparent loss in effectiveness of pyridostigmine.</p><p>The 12&#x02010;week trial consisted of 4 groups of 10 mice with congenital myasthenia, receiving no treatment, pyridostigmine, salbutamol, or pyridostigmine to which salbutamol was added mid&#x02010;trial.</p><p>Following an initial improvement in strength, a gradual decline in the effect of pyridostigmine was observed in mice treated with pyridostigmine alone. Salbutamol, as an add&#x02010;on drug, significantly counteracted this decrease in strength. Decrement and endplate potential studies showed an improvement in mice treated with salbutamol and pyridostigmine, compared to pyridostigmine alone. Postsynaptic areas were smaller in pyridostigmine treated mice than in untreated mice. Salbutamol, as an add&#x02010;on drug, counteracted this decrease in neuromuscular junction size. Muscle fiber diameters and fiber type compositions were similar between groups.</p><p>This study demonstrates that salbutamol can counteract the long&#x02010;term loss in efficacy of pyridostigmine, by counteracting the disruption of postsynaptic structure induced by pyridostigmine. This study indicates that the &#x003b2;2&#x02010;adrenergic receptor has a crucial role in stabilizing postsynaptic structure.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0006"><title>[O2]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0007"><title>NOVEL PCR ASSAY USING CSF FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF INTRA&#x02010;SPINAL SPIROCERCOSIS AND BBB DISRUPTION</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0008"><title>

<sup>1</sup>University Hospital for Companion Animals, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark.</title><p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be collected into EDTA or plain plastic tubes. The EDTA content presumably contributes to a better cell preservation, however, EDTA is reported to cause a false elevation in the total protein concentration and also dilute the CSF sample, thereby affecting the diagnostic interpretation. To the authors' knowledge, no validated studies support this view. The aim of this study was therefore to determine if the choice of tube (EDTA or plain) influences the CSF analysis.</p><p>The study was completed at the University Hospital for Companion Animals, University of Copenhagen, and was approved by the Local Administrative and Ethics Committee. CSF samples were collected prospectively from dogs presenting for diagnostic purposes or dogs presenting for euthanasia for varying reasons. Paired samples (EDTA and plain) were obtained from the cerebellomedullary cistern. The CSF analysis was performed within 30 minutes of collection and included a macroscopic evaluation, semi&#x02010;quantitative protein measurement, manual RBC and WBC counts, and a differential cell count (neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes).</p><p>32 paired samples were included in the study. There was no statistically significant difference in the semi&#x02010;quantitative protein concentration when comparing EDTA and plain tube samples (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.999). The WBC count did not significantly differ between EDTA (median=2/&#x003bc;L, Q1&#x02010;Q3=1&#x02010;8/&#x003bc;L) and plain tube samples (median=2/&#x003bc;L, Q1&#x02010;Q3=1&#x02010;7/&#x003bc;L) (<italic>P</italic>=0.847). There were no significant differences in the differential cell counts between the two tubes.</p><p>According to our findings, the collection of CSF into EDTA tubes should not influence the result of the traditional CSF analysis.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0014"><title>[O4]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0015"><title>CANINE NEUROPATHIES ASSOCIATED WITH MUTATIONS IN THE N&#x02010;MYC DOWNSTREAM REGULATED GENE 1</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0016"><title>

Additionally, NDRG1 is dysregulated in several cancers. A definite cellular role for NDRG1 remains to be established. Studies of NDRG1 by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and western blot in tissues and cell cultures from neuropathic Alaskan malamute dogs and controls, as well as the ultrastructural nerve pathology of affected dogs, might provide information about the function of the protein and its role in the pathogenesis of both canine and human diseases. No ethical approval was necessary for this study.</p><p>In non&#x02010;neuronal tissues from control dogs, NDRG1 is primarily found in epithelial cells, predominantly localized basolaterally. In canine peripheral nerves, NDRG1 is found in the cytoplasm of myelinating Schwann cells. High levels of phosphorylated NDRG1 appear in distinct sub&#x02010;cellular localizations of the Schwann cells, suggesting signaling&#x02010;driven re&#x02010;routing of the protein. The ultrastructural changes in affected canine nerves arecharacterized by demyelination and accumulation of material in the adaxonal Schwann cell cytoplasm.</p><p>Overall, the tissue distribution of canine NDRG1 is similar to that of humans and rodents. Our data from peripheral nerves and primary Schwann cell cultures suggest that cell biology of NDRG1 is highly dynamic and probably influenced by signaling events leading to reversible phosphorylation of the protein. The pathologic similarities between this canine polyneuropathy and the human Charcot&#x02010;Marie&#x02010;Tooth type 4D suggest that further studies of canine tissues and cells might be valuable in the understanding of <italic>NDRG1</italic>&#x02010;associated neuropathies, as well as cancers, in several species.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0018"><title>[O5]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0019"><title>FUNCTIONAL EFFECT OF OLFACTORY ENSHEATHING CELLS GENETICALLY MODIFIED TO EXPRESS CHONDROITINASE ABC ON FORE&#x02010;PAW REACHING IN RATS AFTER SPINAL CORD INJURY</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0020"><title>

However, variable and unpredictable responses are seen. We previously reported that cOECs can be genetically modified to express ChABC; in this study we tested if this modification provides functional benefit.</p><p>We used a crush lesion to the dorsal corticospinal tracts at C3 in rats, which results in fore&#x02010;paw grasping deficits. Immediately after injury we transplanted either: (i) cOECs expressing ChABC (cOEC&#x02010;ChABC), (ii) cOECs expressing green fluorescent protein (cOEC&#x02010;GFP), or (iii) media control. All experiments were performed under Home Office regulations. Primary outcome measure was fore&#x02010;paw pellet retrieval on &#x02018;staircase&#x02019; behaviour apparatus. Secondary outcome measures included accuracy of pellet retrieval on Whishaw reaching task, and number of foot slips crossing a horizontal ladder. Surgery, transplant and behavioural testing were performed blinded, and animals were randomised.</p><p>Rats transplanted with cOEC&#x02010;ChABC showed a trend towards retrieving an increased number of pellets, and increased accuracy of pellet retrieval, on staircase testing over 8&#x02009;weeks and had a significantly higher accuracy of pellet retrieval at 6&#x02009;weeks after injury on Whishaw reaching task (p&#x0003c;0.01) compared to cOEC&#x02010;GFP and media transplanted animals. No difference was seen between cOEC&#x02010;GFP and media transplanted animals. No difference was seen between any groups on ladder testing.</p><p>These results suggest that cOEC&#x02010;ChABC may improve accuracy of fore&#x02010;paw reaching in rats after SCI. cOEC&#x02010;ChABC may therefore be a functionally relevant novel delivery method of ChABC.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0022"><title>[O6]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0023"><title>CONGENITAL MYOPATHY WITH PHOSPHOLIPID INCLUSIONS IN EUROPEAN SHORTHAIR CATS</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0024"><title>

MRI of brain and spinal cord as well as cerebrospinal fluid of all cats were unremarkable. Diffusely mild to moderate pathologic spontaneous activity occurred in electromyographic examinations. Motor and sensory nerve conduction studies were normal in peroneal, fibular, ulnar and radial nerves, but repetitive motor nerve stimulation with 1 and 2 Hz revealed a decrement of up to 73%. Brainstem auditory evoked responses showed physiological wave I, III, V latencies. Muscle biopsies revealed mild myofiber diameter changes and diffusely increased nuclear internalization, mitochondrial prominence and clustered myofibres with decreased COX and NADH&#x02010;TR reactivities. On electron microscopy, all cats displayed conspicuous sarcoplasmic phospholipid membrane inclusions. Levels of organic acids in urine, and aminoacids and acylcarnitin in serum were comparable to healthy age matched control cats.</p><p>Phospholipid inclusions have been identified in various human disorders such as mucolipidosis type IV. As the mother and her entire litter have been affected, an inherited myopathy seems most likely.

The aim of this retrospective study was to report the prevalence of epileptic seizures in dogs with meningoencephalitis of unknown origin (MUO), and to define their risk factors and prognosis.</p><p>The clinical records and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of dogs diagnosed with MUO were reviewed. Dogs with prior neurologic insult or history of seizures were excluded. Seizures were classified as early symptomatic (ESS) if they occurred within 3 months of the acute episode of meningoencephalitis.

They also showed cortical involvement (in particular temporal and parietal lobes), features of increased intracranial pressure and meningeal contrast enhancement more frequently on MRI when compared with dogs without seizures. On multivariate regression analysis the factors associated with PE were presence of ESS (p=0.034) and MRI lesions in hippocampus (p = 0.014) and temporal lobe (p = 0.026).</p><p>These results demonstrate that dogs with MUO and ESS are at higher risk of PE.

In humans, common seizure&#x02010;precipitating factors include for example stress, sleep deprivation and infectious diseases. We hypothesized that seizure&#x02010;precipitating factors are common in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy, and the occurrence of these factors associate with the patients&#x02019; signalment, personality, and epilepsy&#x02010;related factors. Furthermore, we hypothesized that most dogs with idiopathic epilepsy have protective factors for seizures.</p><p>In this cross&#x02010;sectional observational study, we collected 50 dogs with idiopathic epilepsy from the hospital populations of the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital of University of Helsinki and privately&#x02010;owned Referral Animal Hospital Aisti. The owners were interviewed about their dogs&#x02019; possible seizure&#x02010;precipitating factors and protective factors according to a predefined questionnaire.</p><p>In our study population the prevalence of seizure&#x02010;precipitating factors was 74% and the most frequently reported factors included stress&#x02010;related situations, sleep deprivation, weather, and hormonal factors. Almost all of the studied dogs had both precipitated and unprecipitated seizures. Most commonly the seizure occurred within 24 h of exposure to the precipitating factor. In dogs with focal onset seizures, the number of precipitating factors was 1.9 times higher compared to dogs with generalized seizures. Additionally, 60% of owners recognized at least one protective factor for seizures.</p><p>In conclusion, seizure&#x02010;precipitating factors are common in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy and the nature of these factors is consistent with those reported among human patients. By acknowledging and avoiding patients&#x02019; seizure&#x02010;precipitating factors, veterinarians could achieve better treatment outcomes.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0042"><title>[O11]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0043"><title>DELETION IN MITOCHONDRIAL PEPTIDASE RESULTS IN LETHAL JUVENILE BRAIN DISORDER WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS IN DOGS</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0044"><title>

Postoperative CT images were also obtained in all cases, allowing to grade screw positions based on the amount and location of breach outside the intended bone corridor.</p><p>Nine dogs met the inclusion criteria for a total of 45 implants positioned. Immediately after surgery, all constructs were considered unlikely to impair neurovascular structures. Upon retrospective review, 35 screws were graded as optimal, 7 protruded outside the intended bone corridor but not within the vertebral canal (VC) and 3 actually caused VC violation. The cranial articular surface of the axis had the highest rate of optimal implant placement (17/18). Monocortical screws placed in the sagittal plane of the axis often penetrated C2&#x02010;3 intervertebral disc space (6/9).

The aim of the current study was to validate the prognostic value of this score.</p><p>The study included dogs admitted to the Koret School Veterinary Teaching Hospital with TBI within 72 hours of injury that underwent CT examination of the head</p><p>Obtained data included signalment, medical history, physical and neurologic examination findings and short&#x02010;term outcome (up to 14&#x02009;days). All CT scans were reviewed by neurologist and radiologist blinded to the clinical status and outcome; then, KCTS was calculated for each dog.</p><p>Fourteen dogs met the inclusion criteria, of which 12 (85%) survived. CT scans revealed cranial vault fractures, parenchymal abnormalities, or both in 10/14 dogs (71%). ROC analysis for prediction of survival by the KCTS yielded an area under the curve of 0.896 (95% confidence interval, 0.726&#x02010;1). A KCTS score of &#x0003c;3 points was associated with survival with 83% sensitivity and 100% specificity.</p><p>These preliminary results show the high potential of the KCTS to predict prognosis in dogs with TBI. Further testing with larger cohorts is needed to increase the statistical power of the results.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0070"><title>[O18]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0071"><title>FRACTURES OF THE SECOND CERVICAL VERTEBRA IN 66 DOGS AND 3 CATS: A MULTICENTRIC RETROSPECTIVE STUDY</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0072"><title>

Mean age was 2.75&#x02009;years. Motor vehicle accident was the most common inciting cause, followed by frontal collision (running into an object). Neurological symptoms ranged from mere cervical pain with or without mild ataxia (n=22), to tetraparesis (n=28) and tetraplegia (n=11). Neither weight nor age, type of trauma, length of the axis (cm), or degree of clinical symptoms had an impact on the type of axis fracture seen. Concerning treatment, 54% of patients underwent surgical fracture stabilisation, 39% received conservative therapy and 7% were immediately euthanized. Functional motor recovery was achieved in 90% of all treated cases. Due to the low number of cases lacking functional motor recovery, no reliable predictive factors for outcome were detectable.</p><p>Fractures of the axis most commonly occur in young dogs. In many cases, neurological symptoms are relatively mild. Generally, animals with a fractured axis have a very good prognosis for functional motor recovery, irrespective of whether they undergo surgery or conservative treatment. The risk of perioperative mortality seems to be much lower than previously reported.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0074"><title>[O19]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0075"><title>CEREBROSPINAL FLUID PULSATION WITHIN CANINE SPINAL ARACHNOID DIVERTICULAE AS MEASURED ON CINE BALANCED FAST FIELD ECHO MRI</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0076"><title>

Numerous imaging techniques have been described in SAD diagnosis, including myelography, computed tomography myelography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The present retrospective study investigated the utility of cine balanced fast field echo (bFFE) MRI sequences in measuring pulsatile flow within twelve canine SAD. A secondary aim included characterization of the prevalence and location of syringes in relation to the SAD, as the co&#x02010;occurrence of these conditions has not been previously reported.</p><p>The degree of pulsatile flow within each SAD was calculated as the change in area per cardiac cycle on sagittal (12/12) and transverse (7/12) cardiac&#x02010;gated cine bFFE MRI sequences. Syringes were identified as any intra&#x02010;parenchymal fluid&#x02010;filled lesion &#x0003e;2mm width on T2W transverse sequence, and classified as rostral or caudal to each SAD when present.</p><p>Pulsation was identified on all cine sequences, with a median ratio of change in SAD area from minimum to maximum of 0.14 (Range 0.10 &#x02013; 0.27; N = 12) on sagittal cine bFFE and 0.22 (Range 0.05 &#x02013; 0.53; N = 7) on transverse cine bFFE. A high prevalence of syringomyelia was identified (11/12; 92%) on T2W sequences, occurring both rostral (5/12; 42%) and caudal (7/12; 58%) to the SAD. Results support the ability of cine bFFE sequences to identify abnormal CSF pulsation within SAD, and identify a high co&#x02010;occurrence of SAD and syringomyelia in the study population.</p><p>Study submitted for ethical approval to SSRERB at authors&#x02019; affiliated institution.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0078"><title>[O20]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0079"><title>TREATMENT OF CANINE GLIOMAS WITH SYSTEMIC ONCOLYTIC VIRUS DELIVERED BY ALLOGENEIC MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0080"><title>

The pathogenesis of TAE is poorly understood but recently neurotoxic concentrations of glutamate, released by tumor cells, have been advocated as an epileptogenic key factor. The cystine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11 is considered a major pathway of glioma glutamate release. As it can be pharmacologically targeted, we investigated its expression and its association to TAE in a population of dogs affected by neuroglial tumors.</p><p>Altogether, 24 glioma patients with (15/24) or without TAE (9/24) were included in the study. SLC7A11 expression was visualized immunohistologically and semiquantitatively rated within (1) the tumour, (2) the peritumoural and (3) remote brain parenchyma using standard algorithms.</p><p>SLC7A11 was successfully traced in all brains. Intratumoural expression was clearly higher in oligodendroglioma than astrocytoma but it did not correlate to seizure prevalence or tumour grade. In epileptic dogs, however, the peritumoural and/or remote expression fraction was significantly higher than in non&#x02010;epileptic glioma patients.</p><p>Canine TAE brains show an increased SLC7A11 expression in the perilesional and remote brain parenchyma. It may therefore be a valuable target for tailored TAE treatment. Being a surrogate of hyperexcitability, it furthermore substantiates the concept of colocalizing and distant ictal&#x02010;onset zones. The hypothesis requires to be further addresses by coregistration studies implementing glutamate spectroscopy.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0086"><title>[O22]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0087"><title>CANINE GLIOMAS IMMUNE EVASION: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDY OF PROGRAMMED DEATH LIGAND 1 EXPRESSION AND TUMOUR&#x02010;INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0088"><title>

Binding of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#x02010;1) to its ligand (PD&#x02010;L1) promotes activated T&#x02010;cell exhaustion and apoptosis. Tumour cells (TCs) evade host's immune attack by expressing PD&#x02010;L1 and stimulating PD&#x02010;1 expression on tumour&#x02010;infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). High&#x02010;grade and astrocytic gliomas express higher levels of PD&#x02010;L1 and immunotherapeutic targeting of the PD&#x02010;1&#x02010;PD&#x02010;L1 pathway is intensely studied; however, clinical evidence supporting these strategies&#x02019; efficacy is lacking.</p><p>Little is known about whether canine gliomas share this immunomodulating pathway. We analysed immunohistochemical expression of PD&#x02010;L1 and PD&#x02010;1 in a retrospective series of canine gliomas.</p><p>Formalin&#x02010;fixed paraffin&#x02010;embedded tissue sections of 18 gliomas including four grade IV glioblastomas, six grade III anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and two each of grade III anaplastic astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, and grade II diffuse astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma were immunostained for PD&#x02010;L1, PD&#x02010;1, CD3, and CD20.</p><p>All tumours contained PD&#x02010;L1&#x02010;expressing cells (&#x0003e;1% positive&#x02010;TCs), mainly in the periphery and infiltration zone of the tumour. Mean expression increased with grade and was considerably higher in astrocytic tumours. Intratumoural and/or infiltration zone PD&#x02010;1+ TILs were observed in 16 cases; however, only three tumours with high PD&#x02010;L1 expression and CD3+ TIL density were considered positive for PD&#x02010;1 (&#x0003e;1% positive&#x02010;TILs). All high&#x02010;grade gliomas contained PD&#x02010;1+ TCs.</p><p>This is the first study to immunohistochemically characterise the PD&#x02010;1&#x02010;PD&#x02010;L1 axis in canine gliomas, demonstrating that spontaneous canine gliomas model immune evasion in its human counterpart.

It has been shown that a medium&#x02010;chain triglyceride (MCT) enriched diet has a positive effect on seizure control and behaviour in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy. However, it is unknown whether MCTs administered in the form of an add&#x02010;on dietary supplement (DS) to a variable base diet will show similar positive effects.</p><p>A 6&#x02010;month multi&#x02010;centre, prospective, randomised, double&#x02010;blinded, placebo&#x02010;controlled cross&#x02010;over trial was completed, comparing a MCT&#x02010;DS with a standardised placebo&#x02010;DS in a population of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy, chronically treated with antiepileptic drugs and reaching tier&#x02010;2 diagnostic certainty. A 9%&#x02010;MCT or placebo oil was added to the dogs&#x02019; diet for three months, followed by the alternative oil for a further three months. Twenty&#x02010;eight dogs completed this study and were included in further analysis. Seizure frequency was significantly lower when dogs were fed MCT&#x02010;DS (median 2.51/month, 0&#x02010;6.67/month) in comparison with the placebo&#x02010;DS (2.67/month, 0&#x02013;10.45/month; <italic>P</italic>=0.0147). Seizure day frequency was also significantly lower during MCT&#x02010;DS phase (1.68/month, 0&#x02010;5.60/month vs. 1.99/month, 0&#x02013;7.42/month, <italic>P</italic>=0.0101).

Eight dogs showed no response or a slight increase (8%).</p><p>In summary, these data show antiepileptic properties associated with MCT&#x02010;DS when compared to a placebo and support former evidence for the efficacy of the MCTs as a nutritive, therapeutic option for a subpopulation of drug&#x02010;non&#x02010;responsive epileptic dogs.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0094"><title>[O24]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0095"><title>PROGNOSTIC FACTORS FOR RECOVERY OF VISION IN DOGS WITH OPTIC NEURITIS OF UNKNOWN AETIOLOGY: 21 CASES (2003&#x02010;2018)</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0096"><title>

Included dogs had complete medical and MRI records and repeated neurological assessments. EOCD was categorized as Group 1: 0&#x02010;7&#x02009;days, Group 2: 8&#x02010;30&#x02009;days and Group 3: 31&#x02010;90&#x02009;days.</p><p>Thirty dogs were included (Group 1: n=13, Group 2: n=8, Group 3: n=9).

ChABC digests the chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) found in the glial scar that forms after SCI, and are inhibitory to axonal growth. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) given in combination with ChABC has shown improved locomotor outcomes in experimental animals. We have recently demonstrated that canine OECs (cOECs) can be genetically modified to express ChABC (cOEC&#x02010;ChABC). To characterise any synergistic interaction between ChABC and cOECs, we designed an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay of cOEC proliferation and migration.</p><p>We used an IncuCyte Zoom Live Cell Imaging System (Essen Bioscience) to take time&#x02010;lapse images of cOEC&#x02010;ChABC and cOECs expressing green fluorescent protein (cOEC&#x02010;GFP) in culture on three concentrations of CSPGs. Using imageJ, we automatically quantified cell number at each time&#x02010;point and manually tracked cOEC migration in each condition. IncuCyte &#x02018;NeuroTrak&#x02019; software was used to quantify cOEC process length at each time&#x02010;point.</p><p>We demonstrated a significantly increased cell number and process length of cOEC&#x02010;ChABCs compared to cOEC&#x02010;GFPs on all concentrations of CSPGs, but no difference when cultured on poly&#x02010;l&#x02010;lysine (PLL; control, non&#x02010;inhibitory substrate). Preliminary investigation of cOEC migration suggests a higher distance and speed of migration for cOEC&#x02010;ChABC compared to cOEC&#x02010;GFP on CSPG but not PLL.</p><p>This assay has shown an interaction between cOECs and ChABC <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting changes to cOEC proliferation and migration with ChABC that may impact on their function when transplanted <italic>in vivo</italic>, and will allow us to explore mechanisms of this interaction.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0110"><title>[FP3]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0111"><title>A POLYSULFONE TAILOR&#x02010;MADE IMPLANT FOR THE SURGICAL CORRECTION OF A FRONTOPARIETAL MENINGOENCEPHALOCELE IN A CAT</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0112"><title>

The neurological examination revealed absent menace response bilaterally and apparent blindness localizing the lesion to the occipital cortex. Main differential diagnoses were meningocele/meningoencephalocele (MC/MEC). Surgical repair was proposed once the cat reached the adult size. Meanwhile, the patient developed seizures and treated with anticonvulsant therapy. When 8&#x02010;month&#x02010;old a CT confirmed a frontoparietal MEC with associated porencephaly. Based on a 3D printed skull mold, a polysulphone implant was created. The meninges were dissected from the skin, a durectomy was performed and samples of the protruding brain tissue were obtained. Part of the cerebrospinal fluid was drained until the size of the protruding brain decreased enough to be included below the implant that was anchored with cerclages within predrilled holes. The histopathology confirmed the presence of aberrant meningeal and neural tissue. Three months later, the cat is partially blind, but otherwise neurologically normal and seizure free since the surgery.</p><p>There are few reports of MEC in dogs and cats, and only two of surgical management never using a polysulfone tailor&#x02010;made implant. Although a recent study suggested that medical management could be an option for dogs with MC/MEC and mild neurological signs, in human medicine, surgical intervention is the treatment of choice. This case highlights a new implant option for surgical correction of MEC with good results.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0114"><title>[FP4]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0115"><title>CANINE LAFORA DISEASE IN THE CHIHUAHUA BREED</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0116"><title>Irene Espadas<sup>1</sup>, Berge Minassian<sup>2</sup>, Paixang Wang<sup>2</sup>, Saija Ahonen<sup>2</sup>, <underline underline-style="single">Daniel Sanchez&#x02010;Masian</underline>

Additionally, the dog exhibited frequent sudden head and body movements characterised by myoclonic jerks which could be triggered by bright light, loud noises and by approaching towards his head. Comprehensive blood tests (haematology, biochemistry, electrolytes and BAST) revealed no significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were largely unremarkable.</p><p>As per previous studies, LD genetic testing was performed by Southern blotting and membrane pre&#x02010;hydridisation specific for the specific DNA fragment to EPMB2. A population of six Chihuahua dogs were also genetically tested and used as a control group.

A new ICP&#x02010;NI monitoring method developed by Braincare Inc. (Brazil) has been used in research with rats and humans with good results. It uses a sensor that detect changes induced by intracranial pressure waves. Our objective is to describe the first results with this new device in dogs.</p><p>ICP pulse was monitored using Braincare BcMM/2000 monitor. The device was initially tested in three normal anesthetized dogs submitted to procedures not related to the study, to verify the location where the sensor better captured the waves, which was defined as the parietal region, with dogs in lateral recumbence. The waveform had three characteristic peaks, meaning that the cerebral complacency was normal. Monitoring was then performed in three dogs with central nervous system disorders. In a puppy with hydrocephalus ICP was monitored before and after withdrawal of cerebrospinal fluid by ventriculocentesis. In the second patient, with spinal affection, the ICP was monitored before, during and after injection of contrast in the subarachnoid space for myelography. In a patient with brain injury, ICP was monitored after application of mannitol and one hour later. In all cases, it was possible to observe that the P2 peak was higher than the P1 peak at times of ICP increase, indicating decreased brain complacency.</p><p>This novel ICP&#x02010; NI method is capable of monitoring dynamics of ICP in dogs, but more studies are needed to implement the technique in clinical practice.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0122"><title>[FP6]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0123"><title>HIPPOCAMPAL EXPRESSION OF THE CB1 RECEPTOR IN CANINE EPILEPSY</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0124"><title>

The CB1 receptor is known to control neuronal activity on the synaptic level by negative feedback mechanism. Endocannabinoids are elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in epileptic dogs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe CB1 receptors in epileptic patients and quantitatively compare them to healthy dogs.</p><p>CB1 receptor expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry of the brains of seven controls, seven dogs with structural and five with idiopathic epilepsy (CB1, Abcam ab23703). Hippocampal density and intensity of CB1 receptor expression were analysed in cornu ammonis (CA) 1, CA3, dentate gyrus (DG) and hilus using ImageJ software (U.S. National Institutes of Health).</p><p>CB1 receptor expression was confirmed in the hippocampus of all dogs. In CA1 the area expressing CB1 receptor was smaller in patients with idiopathic as compared to patients with structural epilepsy (p&#x0003c;0.0001) or healthy dogs (p&#x0003c;0.001). In the same region, intensity of the CB1 receptor staining was stronger in dogs with idiopathic than structural epilepsy (p&#x0003c;0.001). Statistically significant group differences with smaller area and higher intensity of CB1 receptor expression in idiopathic epilepsy dogs in comparison to structural epilepsy occurred in DG, CA3 and hilus.</p><p>Our results give evidence for a downregulation of CB1 receptor expression in idiopathic canine epilepsy in sub&#x02010;regions of the hippocampus. The disease seems to cause redistribution of CB1 receptors proving that the endocannabinoid system is a major component of epileptogenesis which could enable therapeutic approach.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0126"><title>[FP7]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0127"><title>PROGNOSIS OF NON&#x02010;AMBULATORY DOGS WITH CERVICAL INTERVERTEBRAL DISC HERNIATION AFTER SINGLE VERSUS MULTIPLE VENTRAL SLOT DECOMPRESSION</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0128"><title>

Histopathologic examination showed mild changes in the spinal cord with some spheroids and digestion chambers. In the dilated venous sinus there were severe degenerative changes, with multifocal areas of hyalinization within the tunica media with infiltration of macrophages, siderophages and neutrophilic granulocytes. Also, within the tunica adventitia there were small bleedings and hemosiderin filled macrophages. The endothelium was irregular and even completely missing in some parts of the vessel. The findings indicate an aneurysm with secondary dissection through the vessel wall.</p><p>Aneurysms in humans have been described as having a variety of causes including high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, tumors, infection, trauma, abnormal blood flow and hereditary anomalies.

<sup>1</sup>Royal Veterinary College, The Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead Lane, Hatfield, Herts, United Kingdom</title><p>A bidirectional relationship exists between seizures and stress; stress is the most common seizure precipitant in people with epilepsy, and recent research has revealed the acutely stressful nature of generalised seizures in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy (IE). Although significant spikes in salivary cortisol are observed immediately post&#x02010;seizure, the effect of repeated seizures on the hypothalamic&#x02010;pituitary&#x02010;adrenal (HPA) axis is not yet known. This study aimed to investigate the effect of chronic seizure activity on hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), a chronic stress measure in dogs.</p><p>Owners of Border Collies (BCs; n=135) reported their dog's clinical history and collected a 0.5 g hair sample from their dog's dorsal neck region. Dogs were included in the IE group if they met International Veterinary Epilepsy Task Force tier I criteria, and in the control group if they had no history of specified health conditions. HCC was determined using established methods with a commercial cortisol assay kit (Salimetrics). Samples from 46 BCs with IE and 89 control BCs were analysed; HCC was significantly lower in dogs with IE compared to controls (p=0.02). Within the IE group, total number of seizures was negatively correlated with HCC (r=&#x02010;0.31, p=0.04).</p><p>Despite acute increases in salivary cortisol observed following seizures, HCC was lower in dogs with IE compared to controls, and lower in dogs that had experienced a greater number of seizures. Chronic stress with frequent HPA&#x02010;axis activation may, over time, lead to HPA axis dysregulation, as seen in chronic psychiatric disorders in people, including depression and post&#x02010;traumatic stress disorder.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0166"><title>[FP17]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0167"><title>COMPARISON OF IMMULITE 2000* VERSUS CATALYST DX* INSTRUMENTS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF SERUM CONCENTRATION OF PHENOBARBITAL IN DOGS</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0168"><title>

Supra&#x02010;sacral injuries lead to bladder over&#x02010;activity characterised by frequent involuntary emission of urine and lack of bladder distension awareness. Currently, no satisfactory method exists to monitor the detrusor activity, that could be used to either block the onset of &#x02018;reflex bladder contractions&#x02019; (<italic>i.e</italic>. neuromodulation) or to &#x02018;inform&#x02019; the patient of the level of bladder fullness.</p><p>Past research has used hook or microchannel electrodes on teased sacral nerves in anesthetised rodents, but faced major obstacles in large animals: (i) afferent bladder signals were masked by electrical noise and bioelectric interference from other organs; and (ii) electrode implantation led to nerve damage and high impedance, preventing recordings.</p><p>We have designed a new nerve interface, multi&#x02010;electrode cuff (from silicone with steel electrodes), connected to a Cooper cable for signal extraction. The cuff design is based on the anatomy of sheep sacral nerves. Using this implant, we have conducted impedance measurements following stimulation of explanted pig vagal nerves. This showed impedance values of ~5k&#x003a9; for frequencies ranging 100&#x02010;1,000Hz, which fulfils theoretical requirements for afferent bladder sacral nerve recording. This cuff contains up to 10 electrodes to exploit the method of velocity selective recording, a powerful technique to discriminate various afferent fibres based on their conduction velocity. In particular, we plan to use this device in a sheep model, in which bladder afferents coding for pressure and volume of the urinary bladder are similar to man, ~38 and 41 m/s respectively.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0178"><title>[FP20]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0179"><title>PREVALENCE OF CONGENITAL SENSORINEURAL DEAFNESS IN A POPULATION OF CLIENT&#x02010;OWNED PURE&#x02010;BREED KITTENS IN THE UK</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0180"><title>Lorenzo Mari<sup>1</sup>, Julia Freeman<sup>1</sup>, Jan Van Dijk<sup>2</sup>, <underline underline-style="single">Luisa De Risio</underline>

In humans, there is some evidence that temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by abnormalities in the hippocampus, but also in brain regions that extend beyond it (amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus). To date, volumetric assessment of the temporal structures has not been performed in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy (IE). Hence, the aim of the study was to carry out a preliminary volumetric assessment of the temporal lobes in dogs with IE.</p><p>The study was carried on 19 Border collies divided into two groups: A; dogs with confirmed IE (n=10) and B; dogs with no history of seizures and normal brain MRI (n=9). Forty 3D&#x02010;T1&#x02010;weighted MRI images (TR 25; TE 4.8; FS 1.5; voxel size 0.75x 0.75x 0.375mm) of the brain were assessed and the volume of the left and right temporal lobe (ROI, cm<sup>3</sup>) was segmented using a semi&#x02010;automatic method (OsiriX 8, Switzerland).</p><p>A statistical analysis carried out using the student t&#x02010;test revealed no significant differences in the lobe volumes between the groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). The interhemispheric lobe ratio was calculated (smaller volume/larger volume) in all the animals and a mean was calculated for group B. Nine of the 10 animals in group A had a larger lobe ratio than the mean value of group B.</p><p>These preliminary findings form the basis for a wider study aimed at determining whether the lateral temporal lobes undergo structural changes and have a role in epileptogenesis in TLE.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0206"><title>[P2]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0207"><title>TRANSTHORACIC VERTEBRAL REALIGNMENT AND FIXATION FOR TREATMENT OF THORACIC HEMIVERTEBRAE IN DOGS</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0208"><title>

Diagnosis was achieved with myelography (2), myeloCT (1), MRI (1), MRI and CT (1), MRI and myelography (1). A right CASPAR cervical distractor system (Aesculap Implant Systems, Germany) was used for the vertebral distraction and realignment, and cortical screws placed one to two vertebrae cranial and caudal to the malformation and embedded in polymethylmethacrylate. Clinical improvement without post&#x02010;op deterioration was achieved in all cases with two cases becoming neurologically normal. No complications were reported during the follow&#x02010;up period (7 months to 4.5&#x02009;years).</p><p>Most surgical techniques for the correction of clinical hemivertebrae in dogs use a dorsal approach with decompression and/or fixation.

Treatment options for confirmed gliomas include radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or combinations with the former providing longer survival time (255&#x02009;days) compared to surgery alone (66&#x02009;days) probably due to incomplete resection. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge there are no reports of reintervining intracranial gliomas in dogs. Herein, we report our clinical outcome in 4 cases.</p><p>Four dogs with histopathologically confirmed glioma previously resected with curative intent followed by adjuvant temozolamide developed tumour recurrence and underwent reintervention. Gross total resection of tumor recurrence was performed using the same previous approach. After the second resection, temozalomide was replaced by toceranib (2.5&#x02010;2.8 mg/kg 3 times weekly) except in one dog (case 1) treated with lomustine after her third surgery (70mg/m<sup>2</sup>/3&#x02009;weeks).</p><p>Neurological deterioration (&#x0003c;24h) after reintervention was minimal except for case 4 euthanized 24h after the second surgery for respiratory complications.

Survival times were 778, 241, 422 and 472&#x02009;days following imaging diagnoses. Cases 1, 2 and 4 lived 176, 73 and 136 additional days from imaging diagnosis of recurrence.

Modern anesthesia is shifting to a reliance on topical anesthetics, NSAIDs and NMDA antagonists to achieve adequate post&#x02010;operative analgesia. Such protocols decrease medication related side effects, shorten hospitalization and enhance quality of post&#x02010;operative recovery. The use of local anesthetics (LAs) has the most evidence&#x02010;based support as a perioperative analgesic in veterinary medicine. Liposomal bupivacaine has been developed as long acting LA to provide extended release action over 72 hours. Extensive studies have validated the local and systemic safety of NOCITA&#x000ae; in dogs: It has been shown to not migrate from its site of application and has been documented to be safe and efficacious following epidural, perineural, and intraneural injections. NOCITA&#x000ae; has the potential to provide valuable and safe opioid sparing post&#x02010;operative analgesia following spinal surgery.</p><p>Thirty&#x02010;eight retrospective cases were collected from June 2017 to March 2018.

To investigate the role of these cells in diseases of the nervous system in dogs in a clinical setting, methods for fast identification had to be identified.</p><p>In earlier studies an ELISA test measuring IL17 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and an ELISpot technique were successfully applied. However, these techniques cannot be performed on a daily routine basis. Therefore, Th17 cells should be measured using flow cytometry. Since Th17 cells are only a minor population of lymphocytes, stimulation is necessary for better visibility. The measurement protocol time takes about 15 hours being the main difficulty for routine analysis. For this reason, results of 10 blood samples divided in two portions were compared: half of the blood sample was processed immediately and the other half was stored overnight for 15&#x02010;20 hours. Cells were stimulated with PMA, Ionomycin and Brefeldin A for 6 hours and Th17 cells were intracellularly stained with biotinylated IL17A (Dendritics, France) and measured by flow cytometry.</p><p>No significant difference between stored and freshly measured cells occurred (p=&#x02009;0.7144). Stimulated Th17 cells account for approximately 8&#x02010;20 percent of canine lymphocytes (n=150).</p><p>In conclusion, storing blood samples overnight offers an efficient way to measure Th17 cells by flow cytometry in canine neurological diseases. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover (experiment number 33.8&#x02010;42502&#x02010;05&#x02010;18A290).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0226"><title>[P7]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0227"><title>CERVICAL DISTRACTION&#x02010;FUSION IN SMALL DOGS</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0228"><title>

Long&#x02010;term outcome was assessed via telephone interview (5.5&#x02010; 45months). A distraction index was calculated to assess for evidence of vertebral subsidence comparing immediate post&#x02010;op and long&#x02010;term post&#x02010;op imaging.

The median duration of clinical signs was 28days (range 5&#x02010;183). 7/8 dogs failed conservative therapy prior to surgery. The commonest clinical sign was ambulatory tetraparesis (4/8). Diagnostic investigations consisted of MRI in all cases and CT in 4/7cases. The intervertebral spaces most commonly affected were C3/4 and C5/6 (3/8cases). Long term, 5/8cases demonstrated an improvement in clinical signs.

Interobserver agreement was calculated with reported MRI characteristics used to diagnose presumptive ANNPE and presumptive IMDE. Only cases with agreement on diagnosis were included in further clinical comparisons. Signalment, activity and possible vocalisation at time of onset, progression of clinical signs, degree of neurological deficits at the onset, IVD affected and four&#x02010;week follow up were compared between the two groups. Ethical approval was granted (URN: M2016 0083).</p><p>Intraclass correlation coefficient of the imaging diagnosis was 0.82. Interobserver agreement was reached in 13 dogs with IMDE and 19 with ANNPE. The only statistically significant difference between the two groups was days of hospitalisation, which was longer in dogs with IMDE (P = 0.028; median and IQR 3 (1&#x02010;5) vs 8 (1&#x02010;15).</p><p>These findings suggest that a presumptive diagnosis of IMDE based on MRI features may not be associated with more severe neurological signs at time of presentation or with a longer time until ambulation compared to ANNPE. Further studies are needed to evaluate long&#x02010;term outcome on these cases.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0254"><title>[P14]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0255"><title>MEDIASTINAL HAEMATOMA SECONDARY TO SUSPECTED VASCULAR ABNORMALITY IN A DOG WITH STEROID&#x02010;RESPONSIVE MENINGITIS&#x02010;ARTERITIS</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0256"><title>

The dog showed a stuporous state on admission and the neurological examination was consistent with a multifocal intracranial neurolocalization. Blood exams were unremarkable while the MRI showed symmetrical bilateral T2 hyperintense lesions in the caudate nuclei and girus cinguli. The lesions were isointense in T1W images and showed a mild contrast enhancement and a mild mass effect. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not show significant abnormalities. The gastric content was toxicologically tested and found to be positive for metaldehyde screening. Thus, a diagnosis of metaldehyde intoxication was made. The dog progressively recovered to normal within 7&#x02009;days with antiepileptic and supportive therapy. A 2 month&#x02010;follow up MRI showed small, symmetrically well defined bilateral lesions in the caudate nuclei with a hyperintense signal in T2W images and a hypointense signal in T1W images, which were interpreted as cavitated lesions. The girus cinguli lesions were not detected on the follow up MRI and were thought to be postictal lesions.</p><p>To our knowledge, bilateral caudate nuclei lesions detected on MRI have not been reported after metaldehyde intoxication in a dog. Such lesions are described only in a few canine reports due to carbon monoxide intoxication or metabolic and degenerative disorders.</p><p>We suggest that metaldehyde intoxication should be included among the differential diagnosis of symmetrical bilateral caudate nuclei lesions detected on MRI.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0266"><title>[P17]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0267"><title>ACTINOBACILLUS PLEUROPNEUMONIAE OSTEOMYELITIS LEADING TO VERTEBRAL FRACTURE IN A WEANER</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0268"><title>

Up to now standardized protocols for treatment to prevent PTE in dogs are not available.</p><p>The current case report underlines the importance of early onset of treatment in immediate and early PTE and the difficulty of preventive treatment of late PTE. Two dogs were presented after traumatic brain injury (TBI), a Jack Russell Terrier (JRT) kicked by a horse and a Magyar Vizsla (MV) hit by train. Both dogs developed seizures immediately after the trauma and were successfully treated for one month (JRT) with Imepitoin and for half a year (MV) with Phenobarbital. Both dogs had no seizures during the whole treatment period. However, after discontinuing the application of AEDs by the owners both dogs developed seizures, leading to death of the JRT in status epilepticus. The MV was treated again with AEDs (Phenobarbital, Imepitoin, Levetiracetam, Potassium bromide), but continued to have cluster seizures every two weeks.</p><p>In conclusion, long&#x02010;term treatment with AEDs in dogs with seizures after TBI is recommended.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0278"><title>[P20]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0279"><title>INMUNE&#x02010;MEDIATED PYOGRANULOMATOUS GANGLIONEURITIS IN A CAT</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0280"><title>

Predisposing factors including body condition score (BCS) have been identified, but the effect of BCS on outcome has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of BCS on rate of recovery and outcome of miniature Dachshunds having undergone hemilaminectomy surgery for treatment of TL&#x02010;IVDE.</p><p>This was a prospective observational study including 37 miniature Dachshunds diagnosed with surgical TL&#x02010;IVDE. Along with patient variables, a BCS (1&#x02010;9) and open field score (OFS, 0&#x02010;14) was recorded preoperatively for each dog. Postoperatively OFS was recorded for each day of hospitalisation, as well as at 4&#x02010;week re&#x02010;examination. Outcome was recorded as overall OFS change over 4&#x02009;weeks, OFS change per day of hospitalisation and number of days hospitalised. Institutional ethical approval was received.</p><p>Median recorded BCS was 6, with 30 dogs (81%) having a BCS of between 5 and 7. Median preoperative OFS was 4 (range 0&#x02010;13), median OFS change per day hospitalised was 0.7 (range 0.0&#x02010;2.0) and median final OFS was 11 (range 0&#x02010;14). No significant association was found between BCS and any of the recorded outcome measures in this study population.</p><p>These findings suggest that BCS may not have a significant effect on outcome and rate of recovery in miniature Dachshunds undergoing surgical management of TL&#x02010;IVDE. The statistical power of the analysis was limited by the low variation in BCS observed and therefore low number of cases in several of the BCS groups.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0306"><title>[P27]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0307"><title>EVALUATION OF PROGNOSTIC FACTORS FOR CATS WITH SACROCAUDAL LUXATION</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0308"><title>Elizabeth Couper<sup>1</sup>, <underline underline-style="single">Steven De Decker</underline>

Information obtained from the clinical records included signalment, clinical presentation, treatment details, outcome and survival time. Severity of neurological signs was graded from 1 to 5, based on previous grading systems for cats with sacrocaudal luxation. Degree of sacrocaudal displacement was calculated on survey radiographs.

Cats had to be given a minimum of 30&#x02009;days to regain urinary function to be included in this study.</p><p>Seventy cats were included. Fifty&#x02010;five of 61 cats (90%) for which this information was available, regained voluntary urinary function.

No significant associations were found between urinary outcome and age, sex, anal tone, perineal sensation, tail base sensation, degree of craniocaudal or dorsoventral sacrocaudal displacement, concurrent orthopaedic injury, tail amputation, faecal function at diagnosis, and survival. Patients that could defaecate voluntarily had longer survival times than patients that lacked voluntary control over defaecation (<italic>P</italic>=0.03).</p><p>In agreement with previous studies, neurological grade was the most reliable prognostic indicator, which may also provide useful information when advising owners on the expected time frame for recovery.

Furthermore, a possible association of these CVMs to the degree of tail malformation was investigated.</p><p>In this retrospective cross&#x02010;sectional study, computed tomography scans of the caudal lumbar, sacral and coccygeal vertebral column were reviewed for presence and location of different types of CVMs (hemivertebrae, block vertebrae, transitional vertebrae and spina bifida) and degree of tail malformation.</p><p>In 84 (56.4%) of the 149 included dogs (53 French, 37 English bulldogs and 59 Pugs) at least one type of CVM was found, with lumbosacral transitional vertebrae being the most common (34.2%). Pugs demonstrated significantly more often lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (54.2%) and significantly less often hemivertebrae (1.7%) compared to English (13.5% and 24.3% respectively) and French bulldogs (26.4% and 32.0% respectively). Tail malformation was significantly more severe in dogs with evidence of hemivertebrae.</p><p>As previously described, CVMs are a common finding especially in the thoracic vertebral column of these three breeds, but this also seems to be true for the lumbosacral vertebral column. These anatomical variances need to be considered carefully when planning for neurosurgical and neurodiagnostic procedures. Furthermore, this study suggests a possible link between degree of tail malformation and presence of hemivertebrae. The clinical relevance of this needs to be further investigated and this could potentially be used to establish breeding guidelines to reduce the prevalence of hemivertebrae.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0314"><title>[P29]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0315"><title>CLINICAL CHARACTERISATION OF A NOVEL PAROXYSMAL DYSKINESIA IN WELSH TERRIERS</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0316"><title>

Here are reported two cases of OT plus in geriatric Jack Russel Terriers.</p><p>Dog 1 (16&#x02010;year&#x02010;old) displayed very rapid tremors in all limbs in a standing position. Dog 2 (12.5&#x02010;year&#x02010;old) displayed very rapid tremors in hind limbs when standing. Both dogs also displayed a hypermetric gait, most apparent in the pelvic limbs. Tremors ceased upon movement or when extensor muscles were not loaded. No intention&#x02010; or head tremor was noted. Electrophysiological testing in dog 1 revealed a tremor frequency of 13 Hz consistent with OT. Oral administration of gabapentin resulted in reduction of tremor severity.</p><p>These are the first two reported &#x02018;OT plus&#x02019; cases in canines. OT has been reported in young giant breed dogs. In humans, age of onset varies, but most patients are presented around 60&#x02009;years of age. In older dogs, a benign, idiopathic, rapid postural tremor (BIRPT) or &#x02018;senile tremor&#x02019; of pelvic limbs is reported.

The neurological signs were evaluated in relation to the pituitary height/brain. In addition, neurological signs were correlated with the presence or absence of MRI signs of brain compression.</p><p>The study included 97 dogs. All dogs showed at least one neurological abnormality, the most common being abnormal mentation (79%), abnormal gait (61%) and cranial nerves deficits (44%) . Out of these, abnormal postural and proprioceptive reactions (48%), head and cervical pain and/or hyperesthesia (25%) and postural abnormalities (21%) have not been previously reported. The majority of dogs with a pituitary detectable mass had signs of brain compression. The presence of an high pituitary height/brain area and brain compression represented a risk factor for developing mental status abnormalities.</p><p>Our results show that dogs with PDM have a variety of of neurological abnormalities which should be adequately considered in order to plan a correct diagnostic and therapeutic work&#x02010;up.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0354"><title>[P39]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0355"><title>LEVETIRACETAM AS FIRST&#x02010;LINE THERAPY IN DOGS WITH SUSTAINED STATUS EPILEPTICUS: A PRELIMINARY STUDY</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0356"><title>

Sustained epileptic activity causes a sharp decline in DZ therapeutic efficacy which worsened over 30 minutes probably due to the SE&#x02010;associated subunit&#x02010;specific trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub>. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a new antiepileptic drug, whom mechanism of action is not related to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of LEV and compare that with DZ in dogs with SE established for &#x02265;30 minutes (ID 817&#x02010;2017).</p><p>10 dogs were prospectively enrolled in the study. 5 were treated with LEV (60 mg/kg IV; group A) and 5 were treated with DZ (1&#x02010;2 mg/kg IV; group B). Efficacy was defined as cessation of seizures soon after the bolus administration.</p><p>3/5 of dogs treated with LEV showed a complete cessation of seizure activity whereas only 1/5 of dogs treated with DZ was responsive. 4/5 of dogs treated with LEV were seizure&#x02010;free during hospitalization. 1/5 of dogs in group B died because of complications related to the SE. Of the remaining dogs in group B, 3/4 had further seizures during hospitalization. To obtain <italic>24h&#x02010;seizure&#x02010;free status</italic>, a mean of 5h (&#x000b1;7h) was necessary in the group A and a mean of 24h (&#x000b1;22h) was necessary in group B.</p><p>This study suggests LEV can be therapeutically more effective than DZ in dogs with sustained SE.

Dog 3 was diagnosed with meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin after detection of multifocal lesions in MRI affecting brain and spinal cord and pleocytosis (6300 cells/3&#x003bc;l, 87% lymphocytes) in CSF. PARR revealed polyclonal B&#x02010; and T&#x02010;cell populations. The dog improved under immunosuppression (prednisolone, cyclosporine) and is stable 6 months after diagnosis. In dog 4, diagnosis was idiopathic pachymeningitis. In CSF, pleocytosis (85 cells/3&#x003bc;l, 86% lymphocytes) and polyclonal T&#x02010;cell population in PARR occurred.

Haematology confirmed a non&#x02010;regenerative anaemia consistent with myelopthisis.</p><p>We hypothesise that a mass effect from the calvarial thickening leads to reduced volume of the caudal fossa and cerebellar herniation. The absence of osteoclastic activity may lead to abnormal growth of the occipital bone resulting in a smaller caudal fossa.

The database of two referral hospitals was searched for dogs undergoing brain and cervical spinal cord MRI for investigation of intracranial neurological signs. Dogs diagnosed with a single intracranial space&#x02010;occupying lesion were included and divided in two groups based on the presence or absence of SCSM. Breed, age at the time of MRI, and cranial morphology were compared between the two groups.

Currently, seizures are considered spontaneous due to lack of understanding of the transition between the inter&#x02010;ictal and the ictal stages. In humans, prodromal activity (e.g. change in behaviour or mood) and seizure triggers have been reported, however this is yet to be explored in dogs. A better understanding of these factors may improve our understanding of epilepsy and enhance management options.</p><p>We designed an online questionnaire&#x02010;based study to identify whether owners believe they can predict forthcoming seizure activity in their dog, to report observed pre&#x02010;seizure changes and seizure triggers. Owners of 228 dogs with Tier I idiopathic epilepsy completed the survey, with 136 (60%) reporting that they could predict an upcoming seizure. The top three reported prodromal activities were increased clinginess, restlessness and signs of fear behaviour. The majority of owners detected these clinical signs at least 5 minutes before seizure activity, and up to 1 week before. No significant association was found between reported prodromal behaviour and breed or age. Triggers were less frequently reported, with stress, food and excitement being the most commonly reported. No significant association was found between triggers and breed or age.</p><p>In conclusion, many owners of dogs with epilepsy perceive both a prodromal phase in their dogs and seizure triggers. Investigation of reported behavioural and physiological changes is required to further identify pending seizure activity and whether a sufficient window of time exists to allow use of therapeutics to prevent an upcoming seizure.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0414"><title>[P55]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0415"><title>TRANSLAMINAR EPIDURAL METHYLPREDNISOLONE INJECTION AS PREDICTOR OF SHORT&#x02010;TERM SURGICAL OUTCOME FOLLOWING DECOMPRESSIVE SURGERY IN DEGENERATIVE LUMBOSACRAL STENOSIS</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0416"><title>

Different treatments modalities are available with surgery appearing to provide a better outcome. Lumbosacral epidural&#x02010;steroid injection (ESI) has been described in a single previous study in dogs. ESI provides a more targeted therapy than oral medication, being applied closer to the affected nerve roots avoiding systemic effects. These advantages allied with rapid response to treatment, gives ESI the potential of being utilised as a predictive test for subsequent surgical management outcome.</p><p>A prospective study was undertaken of 9 dogs presented with DLSS over one year. All patients underwent advanced imaging including CT and MRI for confirmation of a diagnosis of DLSS and an ESI before surgical management. Decompressive surgery included a combination of uni/bilateral foraminotomy and dorsal laminectomy. Seven out of 9 patients improved following ESI, and 3/9 had a complete resolution of clinical signs. In all patients improvement was short&#x02010;lived, with recurrence within 3 to 18&#x02009;days. After decompressive surgery all patients improved, of which 4/9 had a complete resolution of clinical signs.</p><p>Improvement following epidural injection does not seem to predict short&#x02010;term outcome following decompressive surgery. All cases that improved followed ESI also improved following surgery, with the 3 cases that failed to respond to ESI responding to surgical management.</p><p>This study confirms that ESI is a safe technique producing short&#x02010;term good responses in cases of DLSS.

No relation with the head position was reported.</title><p>Physical examination revealed bilateral otitis externa (treated with topical medication), whilst neurological examination was unremarkable. Clinicopathologic evaluation and arterial blood pressure were unremarkable. Neurolocalisation was compatible with right peripheral vestibular system. Despite the resolution of otitis externa, the episodes frequency increased up to once a week. Further investigations included head CT and CSF analysis and were normal. Levetiracetam, Phenobarbital and Imipetoin were ineffective. After three years the dog still experiences daily vestibular paroxysms.</p><p>In this case, congenital vestibular disease, ear disease or structural encephalopathy are considered unlikely due to their permanent nature. Vestibulogenic seizure is unlikely due to lack of pharmacoresponsiveness. Vestibular migraine and transient ischaemic attacks are of central origin, whilst benign paroxysmal vertigo is related with the head posture. Thus, the dog may experience a spontaneous episodic (peripheral) vestibular syndrome similar to the human condition called Meniere's disease.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0434"><title>[P60]</title><sec id="jvim15647-sec-0435"><title>

Subset analysis of test results in patients with intracranial lesions at MRI outlined how test characteristics change with neurolocalisation. Likelihood ratio analysis indicates that the menace response possesses little to no diagnostic value for lesions in the myelencephalon. It is of highest utility for multifocal lesions, and lesions in the forebrain, whereby a positive result is a useful indicator of a possible intracranial lesion. The post&#x02010;test probability of forebrain and multifocal lesion diagnosis is increased by 15&#x02010;20%.We propose that an absent menace response is a practical indicator of intracranial disease, but that a normal menace response does not equivocally exclude intracranial pathology.
