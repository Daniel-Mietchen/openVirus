SALBUTAMOL SUSTAINS THE CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT OF PYRIDOSTIGMINE IN MYASTHENIA</div> <div class="anvanhaesebrouck1." title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title"> <u>An Vanhaesebrouck</u> <sup>1</sup>. </div> <div class="1queen'sveterinaryschoolhospital,cambridgeuniversity,cambridge,unitedkingdom." title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title"> <sup>1</sup>Queen's Veterinary School Hospital, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom. </div> <p>Pyridostigmine is commonly used in myasthenia, but it loses its effectiveness over time. Salbutamol (Œ≤2‚Äêadrenergic agonist) is effective in a cohort of human patients with congenital myasthenia, namely in those with specific gene mutations resulting in disruption of postsynaptic structure. </p> <p>We investigated whether adding salbutamol to pyridostigmine would prevent apparent loss in effectiveness of pyridostigmine. </p> <p>The 12‚Äêweek trial consisted of 4 groups of 10 mice with congenital myasthenia, receiving no treatment, pyridostigmine, salbutamol, or pyridostigmine to which salbutamol was added mid‚Äêtrial. </p> <p>Following an initial improvement in strength, a gradual decline in the effect of pyridostigmine was observed in mice treated with pyridostigmine alone. Salbutamol, as an add‚Äêon drug, significantly counteracted this decrease in strength. Decrement and endplate potential studies showed an improvement in mice treated with salbutamol and pyridostigmine, compared to pyridostigmine alone. Postsynaptic areas were smaller in pyridostigmine treated mice than in untreated mice. Salbutamol, as an add‚Äêon drug, counteracted this decrease in neuromuscular junction size. Muscle fiber diameters and fiber type compositions were similar between groups. </p> <p>This study demonstrates that salbutamol can counteract the long‚Äêterm loss in efficacy of pyridostigmine, by counteracting the disruption of postsynaptic structure induced by pyridostigmine. This study indicates that the Œ≤2‚Äêadrenergic receptor has a crucial role in stabilizing postsynaptic structure. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="[o2]" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Additionally, NDRG1 is dysregulated in several cancers. A definite cellular role for NDRG1 remains to be established. Studies of NDRG1 by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and western blot in tissues and cell cultures from neuropathic Alaskan malamute dogs and controls, as well as the ultrastructural nerve pathology of affected dogs, might provide information about the function of the protein and its role in the pathogenesis of both canine and human diseases. No ethical approval was necessary for this study. </p> <p>In non‚Äêneuronal tissues from control dogs, NDRG1 is primarily found in epithelial cells, predominantly localized basolaterally. In canine peripheral nerves, NDRG1 is found in the cytoplasm of myelinating Schwann cells. High levels of phosphorylated NDRG1 appear in distinct sub‚Äêcellular localizations of the Schwann cells, suggesting signaling‚Äêdriven re‚Äêrouting of the protein. The ultrastructural changes in affected canine nerves arecharacterized by demyelination and accumulation of material in the adaxonal Schwann cell cytoplasm. </p> <p>Overall, the tissue distribution of canine NDRG1 is similar to that of humans and rodents. Our data from peripheral nerves and primary Schwann cell cultures suggest that cell biology of NDRG1 is highly dynamic and probably influenced by signaling events leading to reversible phosphorylation of the protein. The pathologic similarities between this canine polyneuropathy and the human Charcot‚ÄêMarie‚ÄêTooth type 4D suggest that further studies of canine tissues and cells might be valuable in the understanding of <i>NDRG1</i>‚Äêassociated neuropathies, as well as cancers, in several species. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="[o5]" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Furthermore, we hypothesized that most dogs with idiopathic epilepsy have protective factors for seizures. </p> <p>In this cross‚Äêsectional observational study, we collected 50 dogs with idiopathic epilepsy from the hospital populations of the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital of University of Helsinki and privately‚Äêowned Referral Animal Hospital Aisti.

Serum biomarkers show promise as prognostic tools but their concentrations change over time. The purpose of this study was to describe the time course of serum concentrations of glial (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP, and S100Œ≤) and neuronal (phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, pNF‚ÄêH) biomarkers after severe spinal cord injury in dogs.

The association between outcome and serum levels was examined using regression tree and ROC curve analysis. </p> <p>Thirty‚Äêone dogs were included, 19/31 (62%) recovered independent ambulation by 6 months. GFAP and S100Œ≤ concentrations peaked within 3‚Äâdays and rapidly decreased. PNF‚ÄêH peaked at 14‚Äâdays and was still detectable at 8‚Äâweeks. A GFAP concentration of &amp;lt;0.31ng/mL within 72 hours of onset of paralysis predicted outcome with an accuracy of 0.84. </p> <p>Severe spinal cord injury causes ongoing axonal degeneration that produces prolonged elevation of serum pNF‚ÄêH while astrocytic injury resolves rapidly.

Immediately after surgery, all constructs were considered unlikely to impair neurovascular structures. Upon retrospective review, 35 screws were graded as optimal, 7 protruded outside the intended bone corridor but not within the vertebral canal (VC) and 3 actually caused VC violation. The cranial articular surface of the axis had the highest rate of optimal implant placement (17/18).

Neither weight nor age, type of trauma, length of the axis (cm), or degree of clinical symptoms had an impact on the type of axis fracture seen. Concerning treatment, 54% of patients underwent surgical fracture stabilisation, 39% received conservative therapy and 7% were immediately euthanized.

The pathogenesis of TAE is poorly understood but recently neurotoxic concentrations of glutamate, released by tumor cells, have been advocated as an epileptogenic key factor. The cystine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11 is considered a major pathway of glioma glutamate release. As it can be pharmacologically targeted, we investigated its expression and its association to TAE in a population of dogs affected by neuroglial tumors. </p> <p>Altogether, 24 glioma patients with (15/24) or without TAE (9/24) were included in the study. SLC7A11 expression was visualized immunohistologically and semiquantitatively rated within (1) the tumour, (2) the peritumoural and (3) remote brain parenchyma using standard algorithms. </p> <p>SLC7A11 was successfully traced in all brains. Intratumoural expression was clearly higher in oligodendroglioma than astrocytoma but it did not correlate to seizure prevalence or tumour grade. In epileptic dogs, however, the peritumoural and/or remote expression fraction was significantly higher than in non‚Äêepileptic glioma patients. </p> <p>Canine TAE brains show an increased SLC7A11 expression in the perilesional and remote brain parenchyma. It may therefore be a valuable target for tailored TAE treatment. Being a surrogate of hyperexcitability, it furthermore substantiates the concept of colocalizing and distant ictal‚Äêonset zones.

Binding of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‚Äê1) to its ligand (PD‚ÄêL1) promotes activated T‚Äêcell exhaustion and apoptosis. Tumour cells (TCs) evade host's immune attack by expressing PD‚ÄêL1 and stimulating PD‚Äê1 expression on tumour‚Äêinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). High‚Äêgrade and astrocytic gliomas express higher levels of PD‚ÄêL1 and immunotherapeutic targeting of the PD‚Äê1‚ÄêPD‚ÄêL1 pathway is intensely studied; however, clinical evidence supporting these strategies‚Äô efficacy is lacking. </p> <p>Little is known about whether canine gliomas share this immunomodulating pathway. We analysed immunohistochemical expression of PD‚ÄêL1 and PD‚Äê1 in a retrospective series of canine gliomas. </p> <p>Formalin‚Äêfixed paraffin‚Äêembedded tissue sections of 18 gliomas including four grade IV glioblastomas, six grade III anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and two each of grade III anaplastic astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, and grade II diffuse astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma were immunostained for PD‚ÄêL1, PD‚Äê1, CD3, and CD20. </p> <p>All tumours contained PD‚ÄêL1‚Äêexpressing cells (&amp;gt;1% positive‚ÄêTCs), mainly in the periphery and infiltration zone of the tumour. Mean expression increased with grade and was considerably higher in astrocytic tumours. Intratumoural and/or infiltration zone PD‚Äê1+ TILs were observed in 16 cases; however, only three tumours with high PD‚ÄêL1 expression and CD3+ TIL density were considered positive for PD‚Äê1 (&amp;gt;1% positive‚ÄêTILs). All high‚Äêgrade gliomas contained PD‚Äê1+ TCs. </p> <p>This is the first study to immunohistochemically characterise the PD‚Äê1‚ÄêPD‚ÄêL1 axis in canine gliomas, demonstrating that spontaneous canine gliomas model immune evasion in its human counterpart.

It has been shown that a medium‚Äêchain triglyceride (MCT) enriched diet has a positive effect on seizure control and behaviour in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy.

Early onset clinical deterioration (EOCD) occurs in some dogs after surgery. A retrospective study was performed to characterize EOCD causes within 90‚Äâdays of hemilaminectomy and evaluate outcomes following a second surgery. Included dogs had complete medical and MRI records and repeated neurological assessments. EOCD was categorized as Group 1: 0‚Äê7‚Äâdays, Group 2: 8‚Äê30‚Äâdays and Group 3: 31‚Äê90‚Äâdays. </p> <p>Thirty dogs were included (Group 1: n=13, Group 2: n=8, Group 3: n=9). EOCD occurred in 2.0% of hemilaminectomies in the study period (2010‚Äê2017). Four causes of EOCD were identified: further extrusion of nucleus pulposus at original IVDE site (n=15), extrusion of an adjacent disc (n=6), haematoma at original surgical site (n=5) or extrusion of an unrelated disc (n=4). </p> <p>Dogs in Group 1 were heavier (p=0.02, OR: 6.5) and more often had EOCD due to haematoma (p=0.017, OR:16.4).

Based on a 3D printed skull mold, a polysulphone implant was created. The meninges were dissected from the skin, a durectomy was performed and samples of the protruding brain tissue were obtained. Part of the cerebrospinal fluid was drained until the size of the protruding brain decreased enough to be included below the implant that was anchored with cerclages within predrilled holes.

The CB1 receptor is known to control neuronal activity on the synaptic level by negative feedback mechanism. Endocannabinoids are elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in epileptic dogs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe CB1 receptors in epileptic patients and quantitatively compare them to healthy dogs. </p> <p>CB1 receptor expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry of the brains of seven controls, seven dogs with structural and five with idiopathic epilepsy (CB1, Abcam ab23703). Hippocampal density and intensity of CB1 receptor expression were analysed in cornu ammonis (CA) 1, CA3, dentate gyrus (DG) and hilus using ImageJ software (U.S. National Institutes of Health). </p> <p>CB1 receptor expression was confirmed in the hippocampus of all dogs. In CA1 the area expressing CB1 receptor was smaller in patients with idiopathic as compared to patients with structural epilepsy (p&amp;lt;0.0001) or healthy dogs (p&amp;lt;0.001). In the same region, intensity of the CB1 receptor staining was stronger in dogs with idiopathic than structural epilepsy (p&amp;lt;0.001). Statistically significant group differences with smaller area and higher intensity of CB1 receptor expression in idiopathic epilepsy dogs in comparison to structural epilepsy occurred in DG, CA3 and hilus. </p> <p>Our results give evidence for a downregulation of CB1 receptor expression in idiopathic canine epilepsy in sub‚Äêregions of the hippocampus. The disease seems to cause redistribution of CB1 receptors proving that the endocannabinoid system is a major component of epileptogenesis which could enable therapeutic approach. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="[fp7]" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Although significant spikes in salivary cortisol are observed immediately post‚Äêseizure, the effect of repeated seizures on the hypothalamic‚Äêpituitary‚Äêadrenal (HPA) axis is not yet known. This study aimed to investigate the effect of chronic seizure activity on hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), a chronic stress measure in dogs. </p> <p>Owners of Border Collies (BCs; n=135) reported their dog's clinical history and collected a 0.5 g hair sample from their dog's dorsal neck region. Dogs were included in the IE group if they met International Veterinary Epilepsy Task Force tier I criteria, and in the control group if they had no history of specified health conditions. HCC was determined using established methods with a commercial cortisol assay kit (Salimetrics). Samples from 46 BCs with IE and 89 control BCs were analysed; HCC was significantly lower in dogs with IE compared to controls (p=0.02). Within the IE group, total number of seizures was negatively correlated with HCC (r=‚Äê0.31, p=0.04). </p> <p>Despite acute increases in salivary cortisol observed following seizures, HCC was lower in dogs with IE compared to controls, and lower in dogs that had experienced a greater number of seizures.

Currently, no satisfactory method exists to monitor the detrusor activity, that could be used to either block the onset of ‚Äòreflex bladder contractions‚Äô ( <i>i.e</i>. neuromodulation) or to ‚Äòinform‚Äô the patient of the level of bladder fullness. </p> <p>Past research has used hook or microchannel electrodes on teased sacral nerves in anesthetised rodents, but faced major obstacles in large animals: (i) afferent bladder signals were masked by electrical noise and bioelectric interference from other organs; and (ii) electrode implantation led to nerve damage and high impedance, preventing recordings. </p> <p>We have designed a new nerve interface, multi‚Äêelectrode cuff (from silicone with steel electrodes), connected to a Cooper cable for signal extraction. The cuff design is based on the anatomy of sheep sacral nerves. Using this implant, we have conducted impedance measurements following stimulation of explanted pig vagal nerves. This showed impedance values of ~5kŒ© for frequencies ranging 100‚Äê1,000Hz, which fulfils theoretical requirements for afferent bladder sacral nerve recording. This cuff contains up to 10 electrodes to exploit the method of velocity selective recording, a powerful technique to discriminate various afferent fibres based on their conduction velocity. In particular, we plan to use this device in a sheep model, in which bladder afferents coding for pressure and volume of the urinary bladder are similar to man, ~38 and 41 m/s respectively. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="[fp20]" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Forty 3D‚ÄêT1‚Äêweighted MRI images (TR 25; TE 4.8; FS 1.5; voxel size 0.75x 0.75x 0.375mm) of the brain were assessed and the volume of the left and right temporal lobe (ROI, cm <sup>3</sup>) was segmented using a semi‚Äêautomatic method (OsiriX 8, Switzerland). </p> <p>A statistical analysis carried out using the student t‚Äêtest revealed no significant differences in the lobe volumes between the groups (p&amp;gt;0.05). The interhemispheric lobe ratio was calculated (smaller volume/larger volume) in all the animals and a mean was calculated for group B. Nine of the 10 animals in group A had a larger lobe ratio than the mean value of group B. </p> <p>These preliminary findings form the basis for a wider study aimed at determining whether the lateral temporal lobes undergo structural changes and have a role in epileptogenesis in TLE. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="[p2]" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

A right CASPAR cervical distractor system (Aesculap Implant Systems, Germany) was used for the vertebral distraction and realignment, and cortical screws placed one to two vertebrae cranial and caudal to the malformation and embedded in polymethylmethacrylate. Clinical improvement without post‚Äêop deterioration was achieved in all cases with two cases becoming neurologically normal.

To investigate the role of these cells in diseases of the nervous system in dogs in a clinical setting, methods for fast identification had to be identified. </p> <p>In earlier studies an ELISA test measuring IL17 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and an ELISpot technique were successfully applied. However, these techniques cannot be performed on a daily routine basis. Therefore, Th17 cells should be measured using flow cytometry. Since Th17 cells are only a minor population of lymphocytes, stimulation is necessary for better visibility. The measurement protocol time takes about 15 hours being the main difficulty for routine analysis. For this reason, results of 10 blood samples divided in two portions were compared: half of the blood sample was processed immediately and the other half was stored overnight for 15‚Äê20 hours. Cells were stimulated with PMA, Ionomycin and Brefeldin A for 6 hours and Th17 cells were intracellularly stained with biotinylated IL17A (Dendritics, France) and measured by flow cytometry. </p> <p>No significant difference between stored and freshly measured cells occurred (p=‚Äâ0.7144). Stimulated Th17 cells account for approximately 8‚Äê20 percent of canine lymphocytes (n=150). </p> <p>In conclusion, storing blood samples overnight offers an efficient way to measure Th17 cells by flow cytometry in canine neurological diseases.

The aims of this study were to compare the clinical signs and short‚Äêterm outcome of dogs diagnosed with presumptive IMDE to dogs with presumptive ANNPE. </p> <p>In this retrospective descriptive study, 41 MRI scans of dogs presenting with peracute onset spinal cord dysfunction were assessed by three reviewers. Interobserver agreement was calculated with reported MRI characteristics used to diagnose presumptive ANNPE and presumptive IMDE. Only cases with agreement on diagnosis were included in further clinical comparisons. Signalment, activity and possible vocalisation at time of onset, progression of clinical signs, degree of neurological deficits at the onset, IVD affected and four‚Äêweek follow up were compared between the two groups. Ethical approval was granted (URN: M2016 0083). </p> <p>Intraclass correlation coefficient of the imaging diagnosis was 0.82. Interobserver agreement was reached in 13 dogs with IMDE and 19 with ANNPE.

Lymphoma is mentioned as the second most frequent intracranial neoplasm in young cats. In humans, CD is reported as a rare paraneoplastic syndrome in children with Hodgkyn's lymphoma. CNS Lymphoma associated with CD has not been reported in small animals previously. The present report includes an 8‚Äêmonths‚Äêold male, shorthair domestic cat presented with clinical signs of altered consciousness, symmetric ataxia, vertical positional nystagmus, mydriasis, strabismus, intention tremor of the head, and increased patellar reflexes. Neuroanatomic diagnosis indicated a diffuse cerebellar lesion. Blood count analysis showed thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated mononuclear and neutrophilic pleocytosis. Contrast CT imaging revealed multiple hypodense heterogeneous areas in both cerebral hemispheres, mild ventriculomegaly at the level of the caudal fossa, and a circular sharply marginated, homogeneously hyperdense mass occupying the right cerebellar hemisphere. Post‚Äêmortem study indicated a 5‚Äâmm x 1‚Äâmm mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere close to the vermis. Histopathological analysis showed diffuse and severe loss of Purkinje cells with a decrease in the density of granular cells and moderate gliosis. Additionally, numerous neoplastic lymphoid cells were observed in the infiltrated mass consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoma. Inmunohistochemestry revealed expression of CD20 and a B‚Äêcell inmunophenotype.

These were mildly hyperintense on T1W and strongly contrast enhancing. Gradient echo images showed no signs suggestive of haemorrhage. The muscles were markedly swollen. No other muscle groups were affected. The changes were consistent with muscle oedema, attributed to exertional myopathy. Myoglobinuria was not present. This dog made a full recovery following 2‚Äâweeks of rest and analgesia, and remained normal with a follow‚Äêup period of 8 months. </p> <p>Key points from this case are that exercise induced myopathy causes marked, diffuse hyperintensities on T2W and STIR images, with strong contrast enhancement. In cases with focal pathology and without myoglobinuria, an excellent outcome can be achieved with medical management. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="[p48]" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Brain and spinal MRI revealed a thickening and sclerosis (markedly hypointense signal on T1 sequences) of the calvaria with complete absence of bone marrow in the bones of the skull and vertebral bodies. There was severe Chiari‚Äêlike malformation with herniation of the cerebellum and medulla into the foramen magnum. The occipital bone was markedly dysplastic and was compressing the caudal aspect of the cerebellum. The medulla was compressed by the cerebellum dorsally and by the dens of the axis ventrally. Spinal MRI revealed syringomyelia within the C2‚ÄêC3 and C5‚ÄêL3 segments. The maximal width of a syrinx (4.8mm) occurred at the level of T4, at which level very little spinal cord parenchyma remained. Radiography confirmed thickening of the cortices and narrowing of the medullary cavities of the appendicular skeleton. Haematology confirmed a non‚Äêregenerative anaemia consistent with myelopthisis. </p> <p>We hypothesise that a mass effect from the calvarial thickening leads to reduced volume of the caudal fossa and cerebellar herniation. The absence of osteoclastic activity may lead to abnormal growth of the occipital bone resulting in a smaller caudal fossa.

Currently, seizures are considered spontaneous due to lack of understanding of the transition between the inter‚Äêictal and the ictal stages. In humans, prodromal activity (e.g. change in behaviour or mood) and seizure triggers have been reported, however this is yet to be explored in dogs. A better understanding of these factors may improve our understanding of epilepsy and enhance management options. </p> <p>We designed an online questionnaire‚Äêbased study to identify whether owners believe they can predict forthcoming seizure activity in their dog, to report observed pre‚Äêseizure changes and seizure triggers. Owners of 228 dogs with Tier I idiopathic epilepsy completed the survey, with 136 (60%) reporting that they could predict an upcoming seizure. The top three reported prodromal activities were increased clinginess, restlessness and signs of fear behaviour. The majority of owners detected these clinical signs at least 5 minutes before seizure activity, and up to 1 week before. No significant association was found between reported prodromal behaviour and breed or age. Triggers were less frequently reported, with stress, food and excitement being the most commonly reported. No significant association was found between triggers and breed or age. </p> <p>In conclusion, many owners of dogs with epilepsy perceive both a prodromal phase in their dogs and seizure triggers. Investigation of reported behavioural and physiological changes is required to further identify pending seizure activity and whether a sufficient window of time exists to allow use of therapeutics to prevent an upcoming seizure. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="[p55]" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Different treatments modalities are available with surgery appearing to provide a better outcome. Lumbosacral epidural‚Äêsteroid injection (ESI) has been described in a single previous study in dogs. ESI provides a more targeted therapy than oral medication, being applied closer to the affected nerve roots avoiding systemic effects. These advantages allied with rapid response to treatment, gives ESI the potential of being utilised as a predictive test for subsequent surgical management outcome. </p> <p>A prospective study was undertaken of 9 dogs presented with DLSS over one year. All patients underwent advanced imaging including CT and MRI for confirmation of a diagnosis of DLSS and an ESI before surgical management. Decompressive surgery included a combination of uni/bilateral foraminotomy and dorsal laminectomy. Seven out of 9 patients improved following ESI, and 3/9 had a complete resolution of clinical signs. In all patients improvement was short‚Äêlived, with recurrence within 3 to 18‚Äâdays.

Vestibular syndrome in humans can be acute, chronic or episodic; the latter can be triggered (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, central paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular paroxysmia) or spontaneous (vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease, transient ischaemic attack). Vestibulogenic/vertiginous epilepsy is another under‚Äêrecognised nonlesional pharmacoresponsive condition caused by lesions in the vestibular representation in the frontal cortex.

Assessment of cats with suspected spinal disease can be daunting for first opinion practitioners.

221 cats referred for further evaluation of spinal disease were included and categorised into the following disease categories: neoplasia (n=44), intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) (n=42), fracture/luxation (n=34), ischaemic myelopathy (n=22), feline infectious peritonitis virus myelitis (n=18), lymphoma (n=16), vertebral canal stenosis (n=11), acute non‚Äêcompressive nucleus pulposus extrusion (n=11), traumatic spinal cord contusion (n=8), spinal arachnoid diverticula (n=7), lumbosacral stenosis (n=5) and spinal empyema (n=3).

These malformations might lead to instability, spinal cord compression and secondary neurological signs. Surgical management of this condition include segmental spinal stabilization using vertebral body pin and polymethylmethacrylate or interlocking plate fixation which might be associated to decompression of the impinged spinal cord. </p> <p>A seven months‚Äêold, female, pug dog was presented to our hospital with a 2‚Äêweeks history of paraplegia and normal deep pain perception of the pelvic limbs. MRI scan revealed T7 hemivertebra with kyphosis at T6‚ÄêT7 leading to canal stenosis and spinal cord compression. </p> <p>A left seventh intercostal space thoracotomy was performed. After a discectomy of the T5‚ÄêT9 segment, a pair of blunt Gelpi retractors was placed at T5 and T9 ribs‚Äô head which allowed spine distraction and subsequently reduction of the kyphosis. A 6 holes 2,4 PAX plate with four locking screws was used to stabilize the T5‚ÄêT9 spinal segment. Three‚Äêmonths after surgery the dog presented a paraparetic ambulatory gait and continued improving since the surgery. </p> <p>Discectomy, vertebral distraction and stabilization of the affected spinal segment with a locking plate system is a promising alternative for stabilisation of thoracic kyphosis in dogs with secondary neurological signs. Main advantages of this technique include the less invasiveness of the approach compared with bilateral approaches, the natural redimensioning of the spinal canal after reducing the kyphosis and the use of a titanium, versatile implant system which allow screw angulation for an accurate implant placement. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="[p62]" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Anonymous data analysis was carried out to characterise the diagnostic test. </p> <p>The prevalence of intracranial disease in the examined population was 65.7% (266/405 cases).

Subset analysis of test results in patients with intracranial lesions at MRI outlined how test characteristics change with neurolocalisation. Likelihood ratio analysis indicates that the menace response possesses little to no diagnostic value for lesions in the myelencephalon. It is of highest utility for multifocal lesions, and lesions in the forebrain, whereby a positive result is a useful indicator of a possible intracranial lesion. The post‚Äêtest probability of forebrain and multifocal lesion diagnosis is increased by 15‚Äê20%.We propose that an absent menace response is a practical indicator of intracranial disease, but that a normal menace response does not equivocally exclude intracranial pathology. We also propose that the diagnostic utility of the test result varies with intracranial neurolocalisation. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>  </body></html>
