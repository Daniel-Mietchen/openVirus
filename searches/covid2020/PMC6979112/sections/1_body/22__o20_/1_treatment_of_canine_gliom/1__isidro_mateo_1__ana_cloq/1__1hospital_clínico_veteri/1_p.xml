<p>The purpose of the study is to describe the clinical presentation, disease progression, imaging and pathological findings in 10 dogs with single prosencephalic oligodendrogliomas treated with weekly systemic infusions of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) infected with a canine oncolytic adenovirus (ICOCAV17), designed to selectively replicate in tumoral cells, due to MSC homing capacity towards the tumour.</p>
