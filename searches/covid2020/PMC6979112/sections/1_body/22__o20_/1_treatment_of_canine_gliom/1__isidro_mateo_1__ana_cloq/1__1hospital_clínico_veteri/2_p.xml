<p>All dogs had sudden onset of CNS signs, primarily seizures or behavioural changes that led to MRI evaluation which revealed a single prosencephalic intra‐axial mass with classical radiological features of glioma. Tumor size was measured using transverse post‐gadolinium T1W image sequences (or transverse T2W images when the lesion did not enhance). MRI was repeated in the 7 patients alive after 8 weeks of treatment, which revealed a decrease in tumour size in 5 of them. Nevertheless, according to the response assessment in veterinary neuro‐oncology (RAVNO) system, the disease was considered progressive in 2 patients, stable in 3 and partially responsive in 2 of them. All dogs died or were euthanized at the owner's request due to disease progression with an overall media survival time (MST) of 116 days (range 43 – 199 days) since beginning of treatment and of 144 days (range 47 – 239 days) since beginning of clinical signs. All tumours were classified as high grade (anaplastic oligodendroglioma grade III or grade IV glioblastoma multiforme). All of them showed moderate to severe peri‐ or intra‐tumoural inflammatory infiltrates.</p>
