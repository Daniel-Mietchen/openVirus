<p>We demonstrated a significantly increased cell number and process length of cOEC‐ChABCs compared to cOEC‐GFPs on all concentrations of CSPGs, but no difference when cultured on poly‐l‐lysine (PLL; control, non‐inhibitory substrate). Preliminary investigation of cOEC migration suggests a higher distance and speed of migration for cOEC‐ChABC compared to cOEC‐GFP on CSPG but not PLL.</p>
