<p>Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) has improved walking after spinal cord injury (SCI) in a clinical trial in companion dogs. ChABC digests the chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) found in the glial scar that forms after SCI, and are inhibitory to axonal growth. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) given in combination with ChABC has shown improved locomotor outcomes in experimental animals. We have recently demonstrated that canine OECs (cOECs) can be genetically modified to express ChABC (cOEC‚ÄêChABC). To characterise any synergistic interaction between ChABC and cOECs, we designed an
