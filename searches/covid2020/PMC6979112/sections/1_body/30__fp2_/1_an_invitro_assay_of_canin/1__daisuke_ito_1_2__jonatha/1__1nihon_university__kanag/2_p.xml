<p>We used an IncuCyte Zoom Live Cell Imaging System (Essen Bioscience) to take time‐lapse images of cOEC‐ChABC and cOECs expressing green fluorescent protein (cOEC‐GFP) in culture on three concentrations of CSPGs. Using imageJ, we automatically quantified cell number at each time‐point and manually tracked cOEC migration in each condition. IncuCyte ‘NeuroTrak’ software was used to quantify cOEC process length at each time‐point.</p>
