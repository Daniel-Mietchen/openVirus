<p>The purpose of this study was to identify the genetic variant responsible for an autosomal recessively inherited progressive degenerative encephalopathy that affects Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever (NSDTR) dogs. The clinical characteristics of this disease include degeneration of the caudate nuclei and development of a REM sleep behavior disorder (Barker, 2016), features that distinguish the NSDTR disease from previously described canine encephalopathies.</p>
