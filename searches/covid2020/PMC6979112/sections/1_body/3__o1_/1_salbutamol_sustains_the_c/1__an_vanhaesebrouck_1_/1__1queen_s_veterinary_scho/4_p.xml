<p>Following an initial improvement in strength, a gradual decline in the effect of pyridostigmine was observed in mice treated with pyridostigmine alone. Salbutamol, as an add‐on drug, significantly counteracted this decrease in strength. Decrement and endplate potential studies showed an improvement in mice treated with salbutamol and pyridostigmine, compared to pyridostigmine alone. Postsynaptic areas were smaller in pyridostigmine treated mice than in untreated mice. Salbutamol, as an add‐on drug, counteracted this decrease in neuromuscular junction size. Muscle fiber diameters and fiber type compositions were similar between groups.</p>
