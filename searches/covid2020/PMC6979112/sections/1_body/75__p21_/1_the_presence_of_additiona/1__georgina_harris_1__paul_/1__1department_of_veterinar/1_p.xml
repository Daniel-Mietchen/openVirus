<p>Intervertebral disc extrusion is a common disease affecting chondrodystrophic dogs. It has previously been reported that fenestration of intervertebral discs can reduce recurrence of disc extrusion and is associated with a low rate of complications. This study aims to ascertain if, and with what frequency, additional disc material may be introduced into the vertebral canal by fenestration of the affected disc following decompressive surgery.</p>
