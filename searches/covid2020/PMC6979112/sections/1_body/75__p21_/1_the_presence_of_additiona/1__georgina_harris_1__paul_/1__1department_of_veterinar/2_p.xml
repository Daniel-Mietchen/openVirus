<p>Thirteen dogs presenting to the Queens Veterinary School Hospital, Cambridge that underwent hemilaminectomy and disc fenestration for treatment of intervertebral disc extrusion had intraoperative assessment of the vertebral canal before and after fenestration by a board certified neurologist. The spinal cord was first decompressed by hemilaminectomy and removal of all visible extruded disc material within the vertebral canal. Once no further material was visible manual fenestration of the affected disc was performed. The vertebral canal was then inspected again, and the presence or absence of additional material was noted and included in the surgery report.</p>
