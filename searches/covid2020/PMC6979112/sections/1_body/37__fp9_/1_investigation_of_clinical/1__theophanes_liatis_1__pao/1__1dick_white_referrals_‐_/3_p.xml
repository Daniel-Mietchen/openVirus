Depression (7/14) and ataxia (5/14) were the main presenting complaints. Neurological examination revealed spinal hyperaesthesia (7/14), ataxia (7/14), cranial nerve (6/14) and proprioceptive (5/14) deficits. Neuroanatomical localisation was multifocal/diffuse (7/14), forebrain (4/14), facial &amp; vestibulocochlear nerves (1/14), T3‐L3 (1/14), L4‐S3 (1/14). Peripheral eosinophilia was present in 4/14. MRI revealed ill‐defined patchy T2 hyperintensities in: forebrain (6/14) and L4‐L5 (1/14). These hyperintensities did not suppress on T2 FLAIR in: forebrain (4/14) and meninges (2/14). Contrast enhancement was present in: meninges (6/14), temporal muscle (1/14), facial/vestibulocochlear nerve (1/14). MRI was considered negative in 3/14. Treatment was based on dexamethasone: as monotherapy (2/14), in association with CCNU (2/14), Cytarabine (2/14), Ciclosporin and CCNU (2/14), Ciclosporine and Cytarabine (2/14), Cytarabine and CCNU (1/14); and Prednisolone and Cytarabine was used in (3/14).
