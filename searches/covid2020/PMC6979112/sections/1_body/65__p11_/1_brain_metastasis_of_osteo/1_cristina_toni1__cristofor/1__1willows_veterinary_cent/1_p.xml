<p>The purpose of this case report was to report a skeletal osteosarcoma with central nervous system metastasis. A 9‐year‐old, male neutered Old English Sheepdog was presented with a ten‐day history of altered mentation that had progressed to impaired vision and partial hemineglect syndrome. During the five months prior to referral, the dog had also suffered from intermittent discomfort on the right forelimb. Radiographs of the right forelimb and thorax revealed the presence of an aggressive solitary bone lesion affecting the right humerus with no evidence of pulmonary metastatic disease.</p>
