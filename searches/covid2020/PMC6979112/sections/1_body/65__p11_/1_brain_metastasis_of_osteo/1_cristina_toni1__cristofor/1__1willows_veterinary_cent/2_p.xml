<p>Neurological examination was consistent with a multifocal anatomical neurolocalisation. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain was performed with a 1.5 Tesla scanner. This showed multifocal intra‚Äêaxial lesions, which had a solid appearance, stippled mineralization, marked contrast enhancement and no signs of intraparenchymal haemorrhage. Marked perilesional oedema and mass effect were present. Metastatic disease to the brain from the previous diagnosed humeral lesion was suspected.</p>
