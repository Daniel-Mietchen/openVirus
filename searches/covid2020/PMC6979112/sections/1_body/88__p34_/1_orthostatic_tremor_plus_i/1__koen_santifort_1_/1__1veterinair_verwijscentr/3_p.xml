<p>These are the first two reported ‘OT plus’ cases in canines. OT has been reported in young giant breed dogs. In humans, age of onset varies, but most patients are presented around 60 years of age. In older dogs, a benign, idiopathic, rapid postural tremor (BIRPT) or ‘senile tremor’ of pelvic limbs is reported. This was considered in both cases reported here, but not deemed an appropriate diagnosis due to clinical findings. Indeed, BIRPT cases might encompass OT cases. Especially since diagnostic tests are not often performed in many of those older patients and the term ‘idiopathic’ is not substantiated.</p>
