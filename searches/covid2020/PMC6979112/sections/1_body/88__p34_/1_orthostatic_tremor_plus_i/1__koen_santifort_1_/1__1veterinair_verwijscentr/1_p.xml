<p>Orthostatic tremor (OT) is a rare movement disorder that causes instability and psychological stress in humans. A tremor with a 13‐18 Hz frequency that occurs in the limbs when standing is pathognomonic and part of the definition of OT. When documented in conjunction with other movement disorders, the term ‘orthostatic tremor plus’ is coined. Here are reported two cases of OT plus in geriatric Jack Russel Terriers.</p>
