<p>Dog 1 (16‐year‐old) displayed very rapid tremors in all limbs in a standing position. Dog 2 (12.5‐year‐old) displayed very rapid tremors in hind limbs when standing. Both dogs also displayed a hypermetric gait, most apparent in the pelvic limbs. Tremors ceased upon movement or when extensor muscles were not loaded. No intention‐ or head tremor was noted. Electrophysiological testing in dog 1 revealed a tremor frequency of 13 Hz consistent with OT. Oral administration of gabapentin resulted in reduction of tremor severity.</p>
