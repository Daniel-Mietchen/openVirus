<p>A four years‐old male German Shorthaired Pointer was referred for a 4‐month history of progressive fever, paraparesia and severe lumbar pain. Neurological examination was consistent with a severe T3‐L3 myelopathy. Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound revealed an abscess in the retroperitoneal cavity. Survey radiographs of the lumbar spine revealed changes consistent with discospondylitis at L3‐L4. Computed tomography and MRI of the lumbar spine revealed SEE causing severe compression of the spinal cord at that L3‐L4 and severe osteolytic changes in both vertebrae suggesting instability. Moreover, a retroperitoneal fistulous path was identified.</p>
