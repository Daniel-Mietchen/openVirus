<p>The values of cranial volume, caudal fossa and ratio between them were the same in both groups, and these values showed a positive correlation with the weight of the dogs. It was not observed syringohydromyelia and the only differences between both groups were the presence of the dorsal notch in the foramen magnum as well anatomical variation in the shape of the occipital bone, external occipital prominence, external sagittal crest and nuchal crest, differences resulting from the skull morphology. In dogs with the dorsal notch in the foramen magnum it was observed a fibrous membrane covering it and there was no cerebellar herniation in both groups.</p>
