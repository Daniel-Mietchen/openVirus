<p>Functional Neurorehabilitation (FNR) is an area of restorative neurology, which aims to optimize neuromodulation and neural reorganization for functional recovery. Dogs with sensorimotor complete spinal cord injury that do not recover pain perception after the injury undergo extensive changes in the spinal cord below the injury level that may be manipulated to produce functional recovery. The purpose of this work was develop a scale to reliably quantify the recovery of function in dogs with chronic severe spinal cord injury.</p>
