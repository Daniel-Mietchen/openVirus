<p>ICP pulse was monitored using Braincare BcMM/2000 monitor. The device was initially tested in three normal anesthetized dogs submitted to procedures not related to the study, to verify the location where the sensor better captured the waves, which was defined as the parietal region, with dogs in lateral recumbence. The waveform had three characteristic peaks, meaning that the cerebral complacency was normal. Monitoring was then performed in three dogs with central nervous system disorders. In a puppy with hydrocephalus ICP was monitored before and after withdrawal of cerebrospinal fluid by ventriculocentesis. In the second patient, with spinal affection, the ICP was monitored before, during and after injection of contrast in the subarachnoid space for myelography. In a patient with brain injury, ICP was monitored after application of mannitol and one hour later. In all cases, it was possible to observe that the P2 peak was higher than the P1 peak at times of ICP increase, indicating decreased brain complacency.</p>
