<p>Invasive and noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements are rarely done in dogs, due to complications and limitations. A new ICP‐NI monitoring method developed by Braincare Inc. (Brazil) has been used in research with rats and humans with good results. It uses a sensor that detect changes induced by intracranial pressure waves. Our objective is to describe the first results with this new device in dogs.</p>
