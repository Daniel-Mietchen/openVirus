<p>Discectomy, vertebral distraction and stabilization of the affected spinal segment with a locking plate system is a promising alternative for stabilisation of thoracic kyphosis in dogs with secondary neurological signs. Main advantages of this technique include the less invasiveness of the approach compared with bilateral approaches, the natural redimensioning of the spinal canal after reducing the kyphosis and the use of a titanium, versatile implant system which allow screw angulation for an accurate implant placement.</p>
