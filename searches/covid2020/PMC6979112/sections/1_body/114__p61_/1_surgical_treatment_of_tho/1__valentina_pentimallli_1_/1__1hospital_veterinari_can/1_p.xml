<p>Kyphosis is a commonly detected condition in the thoracic spine of screw tails dog breeds. These malformations might lead to instability, spinal cord compression and secondary neurological signs. Surgical management of this condition include segmental spinal stabilization using vertebral body pin and polymethylmethacrylate or interlocking plate fixation which might be associated to decompression of the impinged spinal cord.</p>
