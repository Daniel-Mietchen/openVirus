<p>A left seventh intercostal space thoracotomy was performed. After a discectomy of the T5‐T9 segment, a pair of blunt Gelpi retractors was placed at T5 and T9 ribs’ head which allowed spine distraction and subsequently reduction of the kyphosis. A 6 holes 2,4 PAX plate with four locking screws was used to stabilize the T5‐T9 spinal segment. Three‐months after surgery the dog presented a paraparetic ambulatory gait and continued improving since the surgery.</p>
