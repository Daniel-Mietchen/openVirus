<p>We hypothesise that a mass effect from the calvarial thickening leads to reduced volume of the caudal fossa and cerebellar herniation. The absence of osteoclastic activity may lead to abnormal growth of the occipital bone resulting in a smaller caudal fossa. This is the first case report where MR findings in a patient with osteopetrosis associated with Chiari‚Äêlike malformation are described in veterinary medicine.</p>
