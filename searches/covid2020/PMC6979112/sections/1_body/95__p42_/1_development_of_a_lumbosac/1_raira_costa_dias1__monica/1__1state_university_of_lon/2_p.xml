<p>Cadaveric lumbosacral spines from ten adult large dogs (20‐35kg), with and without radiographic/tomographic signs of DLS, that died for reasons unrelated to this study were used. It was performed an anatomical, radiographic and tomographic evaluation on the lumbosacral joint of the spine of these dogs, to determine whether a human cage model had adequate dimensions for this joint and to develop a cage prototype for dogs. The vertebral body dimensions and the L7‐S1 intervertebral space occupied by the intervertebral disc were measured by lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs and by computed tomography in the dorsal, sagittal, and transverse views. Measurements were also taken of the anatomical specimens in the sagittal and transverse planes.</p>
