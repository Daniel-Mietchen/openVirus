<p>The human lumbar cage models from LDR, Baumer Orthopedics, Stryker, Synthes, and Vertebral Technologies Inc. brands and cervical cages from B‚ÄêBraun and Stryker brands were evaluated and were found to be unsuitable for large dogs. Thus, two cage models with different shapes were developed using 3D modelling software. Both models had similar measurements and were designed for insertion via dorsal laminectomy and discectomy in the dorsolateral portions of the intervertebral space.</p>
