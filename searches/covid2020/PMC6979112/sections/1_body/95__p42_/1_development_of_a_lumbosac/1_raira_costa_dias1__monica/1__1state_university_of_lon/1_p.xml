<p>Degenerative lumbosacral stenosis (DLS) in dogs is similar to human degenerative lumbar spinal disease, as both affect the cauda equina and can cause neurological deficits and lower back pain. Surgical procedures aim to decompress and/or stabilize the lumbosacral joint. Lumbar interbody fusion technique, by using a cage is the most indicated in human medicine, but few studies exist about cage implantation between these vertebrae in veterinary medicine.</p>
