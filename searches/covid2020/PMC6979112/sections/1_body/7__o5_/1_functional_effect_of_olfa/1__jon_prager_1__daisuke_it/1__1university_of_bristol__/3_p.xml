<p>Rats transplanted with cOEC‐ChABC showed a trend towards retrieving an increased number of pellets, and increased accuracy of pellet retrieval, on staircase testing over 8 weeks and had a significantly higher accuracy of pellet retrieval at 6 weeks after injury on Whishaw reaching task (p&lt;0.01) compared to cOEC‐GFP and media transplanted animals. No difference was seen between cOEC‐GFP and media transplanted animals. No difference was seen between any groups on ladder testing.</p>
