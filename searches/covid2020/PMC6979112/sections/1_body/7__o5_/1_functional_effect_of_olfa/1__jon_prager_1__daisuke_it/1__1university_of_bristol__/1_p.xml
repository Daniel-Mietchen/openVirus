<p>Canine olfactory ensheathing cells (cOECs) and chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) have both, separately, improved walking ability after spinal cord injury (SCI) in clinical trials in companion dogs. However, variable and unpredictable responses are seen. We previously reported that cOECs can be genetically modified to express ChABC; in this study we tested if this modification provides functional benefit.</p>
