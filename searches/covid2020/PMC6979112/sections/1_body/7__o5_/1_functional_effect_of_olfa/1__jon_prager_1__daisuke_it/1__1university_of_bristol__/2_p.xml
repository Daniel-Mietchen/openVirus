<p>We used a crush lesion to the dorsal corticospinal tracts at C3 in rats, which results in fore‐paw grasping deficits. Immediately after injury we transplanted either: (i) cOECs expressing ChABC (cOEC‐ChABC), (ii) cOECs expressing green fluorescent protein (cOEC‐GFP), or (iii) media control. All experiments were performed under Home Office regulations. Primary outcome measure was fore‐paw pellet retrieval on ‘staircase’ behaviour apparatus. Secondary outcome measures included accuracy of pellet retrieval on Whishaw reaching task, and number of foot slips crossing a horizontal ladder. Surgery, transplant and behavioural testing were performed blinded, and animals were randomised.</p>
