<p>A four‐year‐old female neutered French Bulldog was presented for repeated episodes of neck pain. Neuroanatomical localisation was to a C1 – T2 myelopathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a C4 – C5 intervertebral disc herniation. The dog was hospitalised for a week on cage rest and then discharged for a further three weeks of cage rest and analgesia. Her owners reported complete resolution of her pain episodes over this time. Neck pain recurred one week later while on medical management and the dog was re‐presented. A neurological examination localised once more to a C1 – T2 myelopathy. A second MR scan was performed which revealed a new IVDE at the level of the C3 –C4 intervertebral disc space. The initial herniation at C4 – C5 had regressed. The dog had ventral slot decompressive surgery performed at the level of C3 – C4 and at a re‐examination one month later was neurologically normal.</p>
