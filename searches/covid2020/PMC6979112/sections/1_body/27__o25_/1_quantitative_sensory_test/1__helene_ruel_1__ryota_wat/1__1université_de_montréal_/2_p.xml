<p>Thirty‐one client‐owned dogs [6.7 (0.6‐12.9 years); 26.9 ± 18 kg (22 males/9 females)] with naturally occurring neuropathic pain were included. Diagnosis was confirmed via magnetic resonance imaging. Dogs were randomly allocated to receive medical treatment with G/placebo/GM or GM/placebo/G. Duration of each treatment was 7 days and included resting. The ENT and MNT testing were performed on initial presentation (day 0), days 7, 14 and 21. Stimulation was applied to the dorsal aspect of the metacarpus and the plantar aspect of the metatarsus in a randomized order until a behavior response was observed or a cut‐off reached. For ENT, transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) was provided using two adhesive electrodes. For MNT, an increasing pressure was applied with an algometer. Tests were performed twice (60 seconds apart). Statistical analysis included mixed linear model (
