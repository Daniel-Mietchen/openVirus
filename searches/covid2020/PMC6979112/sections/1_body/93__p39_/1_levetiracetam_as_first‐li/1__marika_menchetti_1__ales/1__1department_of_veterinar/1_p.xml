<p>Diazepam (DZ) is the standard first‐line treatment for Status Epilepticus in dogs. Sustained epileptic activity causes a sharp decline in DZ therapeutic efficacy which worsened over 30 minutes probably due to the SE‐associated subunit‐specific trafficking of GABA
 <sub>A</sub>. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a new antiepileptic drug, whom mechanism of action is not related to GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptors. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of LEV and compare that with DZ in dogs with SE established for ≥30 minutes (ID 817‐2017).
