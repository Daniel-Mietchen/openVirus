<p>Owners of Border Collies (BCs; n=135) reported their dog's clinical history and collected a 0.5 g hair sample from their dog's dorsal neck region. Dogs were included in the IE group if they met International Veterinary Epilepsy Task Force tier I criteria, and in the control group if they had no history of specified health conditions. HCC was determined using established methods with a commercial cortisol assay kit (Salimetrics). Samples from 46 BCs with IE and 89 control BCs were analysed; HCC was significantly lower in dogs with IE compared to controls (p=0.02). Within the IE group, total number of seizures was negatively correlated with HCC (r=‚Äê0.31, p=0.04).</p>
