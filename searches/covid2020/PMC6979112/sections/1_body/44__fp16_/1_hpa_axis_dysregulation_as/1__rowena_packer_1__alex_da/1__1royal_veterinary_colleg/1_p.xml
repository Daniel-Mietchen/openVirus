<p>A bidirectional relationship exists between seizures and stress; stress is the most common seizure precipitant in people with epilepsy, and recent research has revealed the acutely stressful nature of generalised seizures in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy (IE). Although significant spikes in salivary cortisol are observed immediately post‐seizure, the effect of repeated seizures on the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis is not yet known. This study aimed to investigate the effect of chronic seizure activity on hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), a chronic stress measure in dogs.</p>
