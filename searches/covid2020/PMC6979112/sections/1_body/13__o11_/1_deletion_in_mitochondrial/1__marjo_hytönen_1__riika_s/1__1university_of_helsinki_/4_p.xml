<p>We have characterized a novel canine brain disorder, juvenile mitochondrial encephalopathy with status epilepticus, and identified the genetic cause. The gene codes for a mitochondrial matrix peptidase, that degrades mitochondrial targeting sequences cleaved from imported proteins. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a slowly progressing neurodegeneration in humans. In contrast to the human disease, the canine condition is rapidly progressing after birth leading to status epilepticus and death. Further functional and pathological studies aim to uncover pathophysiological details of the disease and functions of the identified gene.</p>
