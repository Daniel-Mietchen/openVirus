<p>The macroscopic findings showed severe dilatation of the venous sinus on the right side causing significant compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots. Histopathologic examination showed mild changes in the spinal cord with some spheroids and digestion chambers. In the dilated venous sinus there were severe degenerative changes, with multifocal areas of hyalinization within the tunica media with infiltration of macrophages, siderophages and neutrophilic granulocytes. Also, within the tunica adventitia there were small bleedings and hemosiderin filled macrophages. The endothelium was irregular and even completely missing in some parts of the vessel. The findings indicate an aneurysm with secondary dissection through the vessel wall.</p>
