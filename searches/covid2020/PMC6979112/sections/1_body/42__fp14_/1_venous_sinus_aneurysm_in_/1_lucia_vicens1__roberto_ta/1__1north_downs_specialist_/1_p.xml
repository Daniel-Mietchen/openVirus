<p>Vertebral venous system abnormalities have been identified on MRI in 12% of all sighthounds in a recent study but the underlying cause is so far unknown. This case report presents the histopathological findings of a 3‐year‐old, male neutered Scottish Deerhound with 3 weeks history of severe neck pain. MRI of the cervical spine showed severe dilatation of the vertebral venous sinus, mainly on the right side causing mild to moderate spinal cord compression. The dog died from an aspiration pneumonia shortly after the MRI and was subjected to a post mortem examination.</p>
