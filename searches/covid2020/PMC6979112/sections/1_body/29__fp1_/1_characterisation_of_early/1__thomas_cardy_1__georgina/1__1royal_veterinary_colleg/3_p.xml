<p>Dogs in Group 1 were heavier (p=0.02, OR: 6.5) and more often had EOCD due to haematoma (p=0.017, OR:16.4). Dogs in Group 3 more often had extrusion of an adjacent disc (p=0.02, OR:3.4) and a quicker time to discharge (3.3 days) compared to Group 1 (6.8 days, p=0.049) or Group 2 (7.6 days, p=0.03). At discharge following second surgery there was no significant difference in median neurological grade between groups (Group 1: 4, Group 2: 4, Group 3: 3).</p>
