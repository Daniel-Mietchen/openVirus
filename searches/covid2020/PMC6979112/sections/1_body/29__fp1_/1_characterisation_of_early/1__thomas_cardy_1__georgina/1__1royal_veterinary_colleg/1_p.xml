<p>Surgical treatment for canine intervertebral disc extrusion (IVDE) commonly involves hemilaminectomy to decompress the spinal cord. Early onset clinical deterioration (EOCD) occurs in some dogs after surgery. A retrospective study was performed to characterize EOCD causes within 90 days of hemilaminectomy and evaluate outcomes following a second surgery. Included dogs had complete medical and MRI records and repeated neurological assessments. EOCD was categorized as Group 1: 0‐7 days, Group 2: 8‐30 days and Group 3: 31‐90 days.</p>
