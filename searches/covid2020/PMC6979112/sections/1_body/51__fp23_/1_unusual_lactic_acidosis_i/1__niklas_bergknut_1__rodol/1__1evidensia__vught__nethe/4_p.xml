<p>The late onset of the McArdle disease is similar to what is noted in humans where the disease is often not diagnosed until the patient is 30‐40 years old. Treatment in people consists of exercise avoidance and high oral glucose supplementation just before any physical activity. That way human patients can live to an old age. Untypical for McArdle patients, the dog also suffers lactic acidosis with yet unclear relation to the enzyme deficiency according to lactic acidosis type B. Thus, the outcome in this particular patient is more uncertain.</p>
