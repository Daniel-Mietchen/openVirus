<p>The Marine Mammal Center (Sausalito, California) admits an average of 88 stranded, harbor seal pups (HSP) each year for rehabilitation. Neurological diseases in HSP are an in‐ creasing concern; observational scoring and MRI of brain lesions have been reported. Mercury‐induced developmental anomalies are possible as excessive mercury levels have been identified in harbor seals from California. We aimed to develop a NE protocol that could identify and localize neurological abnormalities, including those associated with mercury exposure.</p>
