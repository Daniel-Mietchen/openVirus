<p>We had to develop new tests to assess neurological function in this species. New tests include: 
 <italic>incline plane</italic> and 
 <italic>handstand</italic> (proprioception and motor function), 
 <italic>dripline</italic> (cutaneous sensation), 
 <italic>grasp</italic> and 
 <italic>flipper fan</italic> (spinal reflexes and limb strength), and 
 <italic>fish head</italic> (visual field assessment). Utilizing this NE protocol, three animals with neurological deficits were identified (hydrocephalus, unilateral porencephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia); their neuroanatomical localization was confirmed by MRI and necropsy.
