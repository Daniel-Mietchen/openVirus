<p>Pulsation was identified on all cine sequences, with a median ratio of change in SAD area from minimum to maximum of 0.14 (Range 0.10 – 0.27; N = 12) on sagittal cine bFFE and 0.22 (Range 0.05 – 0.53; N = 7) on transverse cine bFFE. A high prevalence of syringomyelia was identified (11/12; 92%) on T2W sequences, occurring both rostral (5/12; 42%) and caudal (7/12; 58%) to the SAD. Results support the ability of cine bFFE sequences to identify abnormal CSF pulsation within SAD, and identify a high co‐occurrence of SAD and syringomyelia in the study population.</p>
