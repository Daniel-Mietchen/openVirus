<p>The degree of pulsatile flow within each SAD was calculated as the change in area per cardiac cycle on sagittal (12/12) and transverse (7/12) cardiac‐gated cine bFFE MRI sequences. Syringes were identified as any intra‐parenchymal fluid‐filled lesion &gt;2mm width on T2W transverse sequence, and classified as rostral or caudal to each SAD when present.</p>
