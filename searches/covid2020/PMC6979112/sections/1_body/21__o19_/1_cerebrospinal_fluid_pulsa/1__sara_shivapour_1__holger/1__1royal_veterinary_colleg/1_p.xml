<p>Canine spinal arachnoid diverticulae (SAD) are characterized by focal cerebrospinal fluid dilatations within the subarachnoid space, commonly resulting in nonpainful paresis and ataxia secondary to chronic compressive myelopathy. Numerous imaging techniques have been described in SAD diagnosis, including myelography, computed tomography myelography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The present retrospective study investigated the utility of cine balanced fast field echo (bFFE) MRI sequences in measuring pulsatile flow within twelve canine SAD. A secondary aim included characterization of the prevalence and location of syringes in relation to the SAD, as the co‚Äêoccurrence of these conditions has not been previously reported.</p>
