<p>Structural MRI data were obtained at least twice (1‐6 years between scans) from 21 family dogs (M
 <sub>age</sub> = 3.81 years, range 1.1‐11.4; F = 7, M = 14) trained to lay motionless (movements below 1.00 mm for each translation direction, and below 0.01 degree for each rotation direction) in the MR scanner (Philips Ingenia 3.0 T), without any sedation or physical restrain, for 6‐8 minutes (ethical permissions were obtained). Repeated T1‐weighted images were acquired, inter‐scan range varied between 1‐6 years, number of scans obtained between 2 and 4. Separate left and right lateral ventricular volumes were calculated with FSL and FEI Amira 6.5 softwares.
