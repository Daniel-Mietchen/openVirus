<p>Overall, the tissue distribution of canine NDRG1 is similar to that of humans and rodents. Our data from peripheral nerves and primary Schwann cell cultures suggest that cell biology of NDRG1 is highly dynamic and probably influenced by signaling events leading to reversible phosphorylation of the protein. The pathologic similarities between this canine polyneuropathy and the human Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth type 4D suggest that further studies of canine tissues and cells might be valuable in the understanding of 
 <italic>NDRG1</italic>‐associated neuropathies, as well as cancers, in several species.
