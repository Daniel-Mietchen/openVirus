<p>In non‐neuronal tissues from control dogs, NDRG1 is primarily found in epithelial cells, predominantly localized basolaterally. In canine peripheral nerves, NDRG1 is found in the cytoplasm of myelinating Schwann cells. High levels of phosphorylated NDRG1 appear in distinct sub‐cellular localizations of the Schwann cells, suggesting signaling‐driven re‐routing of the protein. The ultrastructural changes in affected canine nerves arecharacterized by demyelination and accumulation of material in the adaxonal Schwann cell cytoplasm.</p>
