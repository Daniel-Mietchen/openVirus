<p>Mutations in the 
 <italic>N‚Äêmyc downstream regulated gene 1</italic> (
 <italic>NDRG1</italic>) may cause polyneuropathy in humans, dogs and rodents. Additionally, NDRG1 is dysregulated in several cancers. A definite cellular role for NDRG1 remains to be established. Studies of NDRG1 by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and western blot in tissues and cell cultures from neuropathic Alaskan malamute dogs and controls, as well as the ultrastructural nerve pathology of affected dogs, might provide information about the function of the protein and its role in the pathogenesis of both canine and human diseases. No ethical approval was necessary for this study.
