<p>Dogs included in the study were treated with ventral cemented constructs using 2 cortical screws in the atlas and 3 in the axis. Intended implant positions and relevant anatomical landmarks were preoperatively identified using computed tomography (CT) images. Postoperative CT images were also obtained in all cases, allowing to grade screw positions based on the amount and location of breach outside the intended bone corridor.</p>
