<p>Nine dogs met the inclusion criteria for a total of 45 implants positioned. Immediately after surgery, all constructs were considered unlikely to impair neurovascular structures. Upon retrospective review, 35 screws were graded as optimal, 7 protruded outside the intended bone corridor but not within the vertebral canal (VC) and 3 actually caused VC violation. The cranial articular surface of the axis had the highest rate of optimal implant placement (17/18). Monocortical screws placed in the sagittal plane of the axis often penetrated C2‚Äê3 intervertebral disc space (6/9). VC violation occurred most commonly when aiming for atlantal lateral masses (2/18).</p>
