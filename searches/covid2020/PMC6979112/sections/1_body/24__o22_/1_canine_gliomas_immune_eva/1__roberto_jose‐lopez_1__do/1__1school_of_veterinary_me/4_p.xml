<p>All tumours contained PD‐L1‐expressing cells (&gt;1% positive‐TCs), mainly in the periphery and infiltration zone of the tumour. Mean expression increased with grade and was considerably higher in astrocytic tumours. Intratumoural and/or infiltration zone PD‐1+ TILs were observed in 16 cases; however, only three tumours with high PD‐L1 expression and CD3+ TIL density were considered positive for PD‐1 (&gt;1% positive‐TILs). All high‐grade gliomas contained PD‐1+ TCs.</p>
