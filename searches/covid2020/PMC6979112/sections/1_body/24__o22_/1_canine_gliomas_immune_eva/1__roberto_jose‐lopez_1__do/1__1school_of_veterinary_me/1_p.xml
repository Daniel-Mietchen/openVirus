<p>Human gliomas appear to exploit immune inhibitory mechanisms to maintain an immunosuppressive microenvironment and evade immune eradication. Binding of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1) to its ligand (PD‐L1) promotes activated T‐cell exhaustion and apoptosis. Tumour cells (TCs) evade host's immune attack by expressing PD‐L1 and stimulating PD‐1 expression on tumour‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). High‐grade and astrocytic gliomas express higher levels of PD‐L1 and immunotherapeutic targeting of the PD‐1‐PD‐L1 pathway is intensely studied; however, clinical evidence supporting these strategies’ efficacy is lacking.</p>
