<p>We designed and identified G7 peptide which binds GM‐CSF and blocks GM‐CSF binding to its receptor. G7 has a potent capacity for inhibition of glioma cell invasiveness induced by the presence of microglia and exhibits antitumor activity in vivo. Study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee.</p>
