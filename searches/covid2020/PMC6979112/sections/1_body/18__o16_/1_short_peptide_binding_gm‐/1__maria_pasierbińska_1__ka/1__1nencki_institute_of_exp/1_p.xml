<p>Glioblastoma (WHO grade IV, GBM) is a malignant, primary brain tumor which despite many years of research remains incurable. Tumor microenvironment plays an important role in growth, metastasis and response to treatment. Glioma cells overexpress and secrete protein ‐ granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (GM‐CSF) that reprogram microglia accumulated in GBM into cells which potentiate tumor invasion and growth and suppress antitumor immunity.</p>
