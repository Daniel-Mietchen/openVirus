<p>We identified peptide binding GM‐CSF using peptide microarrays, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a technique based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Subsequently, we selected peptide (G7) with most potent capacity for inhibition of human glioma cell invasiveness in the presence of human and mouse microglia cell line using the Matrigel Matrix invasion assay. We confirmed that this peptide blocks binding of GM‐CSF to its receptor using methods based on SPR and Ligand Tracer technology. Antitumor activity of G7 in vivo was confirmed in orthotopic xenograft mouse model using in vivo fluorescence imaging system and microscopic histological measurements.</p>
