<p>This is a retrospective single‐cohort study. The database of two referral hospitals was searched for dogs undergoing brain and cervical spinal cord MRI for investigation of intracranial neurological signs. Dogs diagnosed with a single intracranial space‐occupying lesion were included and divided in two groups based on the presence or absence of SCSM. Breed, age at the time of MRI, and cranial morphology were compared between the two groups. The MR studies of both groups where reviewed by a single operator, and the following parameters were assessed and compared: mass localization and volume, perilesional edema volume, mass effect, ventriculomegaly, and presence and severity of cerebellar herniation.</p>
