<p>Four significant risk factors for development of SCSM were identified: mass volume (p &lt; 0.0001), mass effect (p 0.031), ventriculomegaly and presence and severity of cerebellar herniation (p &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, dogs affected by intracranial lesions having a relative volume higher than 0.028 were 2.01 more likely to develop SCSM.</p>
