<p>This study has identified risk factors for the development of SCSM in dogs with a single space‚Äêoccupying intracranial lesion. When one or more of these risk factors are identified, it is advisable to extend the MRI study to the cervical spine, to investigate the presence of SCSM. Conversely, in dogs with SCSM and no concurrent cervical or congenital caudal fossa disease, the MRI study should be extended to the brain to investigate for a potential mass lesion.</p>
