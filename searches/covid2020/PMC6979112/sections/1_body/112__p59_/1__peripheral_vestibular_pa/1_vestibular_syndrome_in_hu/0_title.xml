<title>Vestibular syndrome in humans can be acute, chronic or episodic; the latter can be triggered (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, central paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular paroxysmia) or spontaneous (vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease, transient ischaemic attack). Vestibulogenic/vertiginous epilepsy is another under‚Äêrecognised nonlesional pharmacoresponsive condition caused by lesions in the vestibular representation in the frontal cortex. In young dogs, congenital vestibular disease has been reported, however it is not episodic.</title>
