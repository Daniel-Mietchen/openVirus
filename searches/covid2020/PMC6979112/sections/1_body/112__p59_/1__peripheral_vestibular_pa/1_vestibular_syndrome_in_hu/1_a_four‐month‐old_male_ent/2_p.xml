Vestibulogenic seizure is unlikely due to lack of pharmacoresponsiveness. Vestibular migraine and transient ischaemic attacks are of central origin, whilst benign paroxysmal vertigo is related with the head posture. Thus, the dog may experience a spontaneous episodic (peripheral) vestibular syndrome similar to the human condition called Meniere's disease.</p>
