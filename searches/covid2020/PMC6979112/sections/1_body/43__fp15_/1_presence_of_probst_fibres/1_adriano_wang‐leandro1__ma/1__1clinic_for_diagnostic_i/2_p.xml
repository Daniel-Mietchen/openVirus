<p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in a 4‐year‐old Staffordshire mix breed dog with CCA. Tractographies of the whole brain, corpus callosum, and supracallosal cingulate fibres were performed. Fibre tracts derived from regions of interest were compared to those of a healthy beagle, which were acquired using the same DTI protocol.</p>
