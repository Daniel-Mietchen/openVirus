<p>Corpus callosum abnormalities (CCA) occur rarely in dogs and are clinically related with hypo/adypsic hypernatremia and seizures. Hypoplasia and dysplasia of the corpus callosum with concomitant lobar holoprosencephaly is the most commonly reported variant. It is currently uncertain if MRI findings in canine CCA reflect a failure of commissural fibres to develop or to cross the hemispheres.</p>
