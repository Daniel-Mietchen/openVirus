<p>32 paired samples were included in the study. There was no statistically significant difference in the semi‐quantitative protein concentration when comparing EDTA and plain tube samples (
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.999). The WBC count did not significantly differ between EDTA (median=2/μL, Q1‐Q3=1‐8/μL) and plain tube samples (median=2/μL, Q1‐Q3=1‐7/μL) (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.847). There were no significant differences in the differential cell counts between the two tubes.
