<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be collected into EDTA or plain plastic tubes. The EDTA content presumably contributes to a better cell preservation, however, EDTA is reported to cause a false elevation in the total protein concentration and also dilute the CSF sample, thereby affecting the diagnostic interpretation. To the authors' knowledge, no validated studies support this view. The aim of this study was therefore to determine if the choice of tube (EDTA or plain) influences the CSF analysis.</p>
