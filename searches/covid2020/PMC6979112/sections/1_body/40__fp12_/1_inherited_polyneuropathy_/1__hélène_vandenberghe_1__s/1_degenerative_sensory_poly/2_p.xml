<p>EMG showed fibrillation potentials in the interosseous muscles of the pelvic limbs and the thoracic limbs in respectively 6/6 and 3/6 dogs and in other muscles in 2 dogs. CMAP amplitudes and MNCVs were decreased in at least one nerve in 5 and 2 dogs respectively. Compound sensory action potentials were elicited but never obtained. Histological analyses of muscle biopsies were normal in 3 dogs and showed myofiber atrophy consistent with chronic denervation in 3 dogs.</p>
