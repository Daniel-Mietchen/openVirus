<p>Cervical MRI showed, at the level of the occipital‐atlanto‐axial joint, a multilobulated T2 and STIR hyperintense and T1 hypointense mass with a well‐defined capsule extending from the caudal aspect of the occipital bone to the mid third of the vertebral body of C2. Morphology and distribution of the mass reflected that of the occipito‐atlanto‐axial synovial membrane. This mass showed a marked capsular enhancement and enhancement of the adjacent muscles.</p>
