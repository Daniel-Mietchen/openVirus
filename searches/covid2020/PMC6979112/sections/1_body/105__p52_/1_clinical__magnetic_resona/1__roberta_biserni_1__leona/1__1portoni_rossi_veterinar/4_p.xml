<p>At histological examination the hypoglossal nerve was diffusely infiltrated by neoplastic elongate cells arranged in Antony A and Antony B patterns. The most solid pattern was characterised by hypercellularity of pleomorphic spindle cells showing marked nuclear atypia and up to 4 mitotic figures/HPF. Large areas of necrosis were present. Neoplastic infiltration did not occur neither in the brainstem, nor in the tongue. Based on histological findings a diagnosis of MPNST was made.</p>
