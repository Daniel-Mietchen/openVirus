<p>342 dogs were included, with 118/310 (38.1%) ambulatory at 6 weeks and 184/297 (62.0%) ambulatory at 1 year. 74 dogs (21.6%) were euthanized due to ascending‐descending myelomalacia. Among the dogs that failed to recover, duration of surgery and anaesthesia data demonstrated a marked positive skew towards several extreme outliers. Median anaesthesia duration in dogs that regained ambulation within 1 year of surgery (4.04hrs, interquartile range [IQR] 1.91) was significantly shorter than those that did not (4.46hrs, IQR 1.91, P=0.017). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated a significant association between ambulation at 1 year and duration of surgery (coefficient=‐0.205, P=0.010) and total anaesthesia (coefficient=‐0.294, P=0.002) when controlling for body weight and number of disc spaces operated on.</p>
