<p>Exploratory research identified a possible relationship between duration of surgery and outcome in severely affected dogs treated surgically for thoracolumbar intervertebral disc extrusion (TL‐IVDE). The objective of this study was to investigate this relationship further. We hypothesized that increased duration of surgery is associated with poor outcome in deep pain negative (DPN) dogs treated surgically for TL‐IVDE.</p>
