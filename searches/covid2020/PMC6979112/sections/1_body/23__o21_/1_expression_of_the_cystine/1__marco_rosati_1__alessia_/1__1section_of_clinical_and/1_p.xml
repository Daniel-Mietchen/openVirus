<p>Tumor‚Äêassociated epilepsy (TAE) is a common neurological sequela in glioma patients. The pathogenesis of TAE is poorly understood but recently neurotoxic concentrations of glutamate, released by tumor cells, have been advocated as an epileptogenic key factor. The cystine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11 is considered a major pathway of glioma glutamate release. As it can be pharmacologically targeted, we investigated its expression and its association to TAE in a population of dogs affected by neuroglial tumors.</p>
