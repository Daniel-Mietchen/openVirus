<p>Canine TAE brains show an increased SLC7A11 expression in the perilesional and remote brain parenchyma. It may therefore be a valuable target for tailored TAE treatment. Being a surrogate of hyperexcitability, it furthermore substantiates the concept of colocalizing and distant ictal‚Äêonset zones. The hypothesis requires to be further addresses by coregistration studies implementing glutamate spectroscopy.</p>
