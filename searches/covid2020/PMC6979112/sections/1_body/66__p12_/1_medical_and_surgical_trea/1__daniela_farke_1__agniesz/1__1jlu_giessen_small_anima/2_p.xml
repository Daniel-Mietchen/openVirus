<p>A one‐ year‐old male mixed breed dog was presented due to acute non‐ambulatory tetraparesis, neck pain and pyrexia. 3 Tesla MRI of the cervical spine revealed multifocal T1‐ and T2‐ hypointense, extradural masses with mild contrast enhancement, and severe spinal cord compression at the level of C6. A signal void was seen in T2
 <sup>*</sup>. This was indicative for an extradural haemorrhage. CSF showed increased protein and erythrocytes. D‐dimers were elevated in CSF (3680 ng/ml) and serum (3430 ng/ml). Based on these findings SRMA was suspected. Partial dorsal laminectomy at the level of C6 was performed. Postsurgical treatment included pain medication, antibiotics, gastroprotection, and tranexamic acid in combination with metoclopramide. Corticosteroid therapy was not started because of its side effects on wound healing, instead treatment with cytosine arabinoside was started. The dog returned to ambulation and was discharged 1 week after surgery. An increased immunoglobulin A concentration in CSF (&gt;0, 2 μg/ml) confirmed the presumptive diagnosis.
