<p>In this retrospective descriptive study, 41 MRI scans of dogs presenting with peracute onset spinal cord dysfunction were assessed by three reviewers. Interobserver agreement was calculated with reported MRI characteristics used to diagnose presumptive ANNPE and presumptive IMDE. Only cases with agreement on diagnosis were included in further clinical comparisons. Signalment, activity and possible vocalisation at time of onset, progression of clinical signs, degree of neurological deficits at the onset, IVD affected and four‚Äêweek follow up were compared between the two groups. Ethical approval was granted (URN: M2016 0083).</p>
