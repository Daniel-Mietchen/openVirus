<p>Thirty‐one dogs were started on imepitoin 10‐20mg/kg/12h and 30 dogs were started on phenobarbital 2.5‐3.3mg/kg/12h. AED dosage was increased overtime (up‐to imepitoin 30mg/kg/12h and phenobarbital 5.2mg/kg/12h). All dogs experienced generalised‐tonic‐clonic‐seizures. In the imepitoin group: pre‐treatment median‐ES‐frequency was 1.50 ES/m (range 1‐4 ES/m); post‐treatment median‐ES‐frequency was 0.95 ES/m (range 1 ES/6m‐3 ES/m); 21/31 dogs (67.7%) developed CS 1‐18m after treatment initiation, 7/31 dogs (22.6%) developed unacceptable side effects in the first month of treatment which required switching to an alternative AED, 3/31dogs (9.7%) did not develop CS with a 3 year follow‐up. In the phenobarbital group: pre‐treatment median‐ES‐frequency was 2.46 ES/m (range 1‐7 ES/m); post‐treatment median‐ES‐frequency was 0.36 ES/m (range 0 ES/3years‐1 ES/m); 11/30 dogs (36.7%) developed CS 12‐25m after treatment initiation. Nineteen/30 dogs (63.3%) did not develop CS with a 3 year follow‐up, 3 of these were seizure free.</p>
