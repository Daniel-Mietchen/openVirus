<p>Case 1: An 8‐year‐old neutered female Domestic Shorthair cat was presented for a month history of progressive non‐ambulatory monoparesis of left thoracic limb. MRI revealed an enlarged the left brachial plexus and the swelling the left C7 and C8 spinal nerves. Histopathology of the C8 spinal nerve revealed B‐cell lymphoma. The cat was treated according to the University of Wisconsin‐Madison chemotherapy protocol (UW‐25) and the clinical symptoms were improved. However, on the 77th day from the chemotherapy starting, the thoracic limb paraparesis occurred. A co‐administration of nimustine and irradiation was started. Although these therapies were effective, the owner did not request further therapies. The cat died the 100th day from chemotherapy starting. A necropsy was not permitted.</p>
