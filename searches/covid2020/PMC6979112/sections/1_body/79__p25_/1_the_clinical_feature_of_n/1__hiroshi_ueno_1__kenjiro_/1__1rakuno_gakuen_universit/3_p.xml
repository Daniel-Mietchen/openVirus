<p>Case 2: A 9‐year‐old neutered male Scottish Fold was presented for a month history of progressive non‐ambulatory monoparesis of left pelvic limb. MRI revealed swelling the left C8 and L7 spinal nerves, respectively. Histopathology of the L7 spinal nerve was doubted (not confirmed). The owner requested the palliative treatment with prednisolone and the clinical symptoms were improved. However, on the 107th day from the chemotherapy starting, the thoracic limb paraparesis occurred. The cat died the 231th day. At necropsy, spinal roots and spinal ganglions at the level of C3 to L5 were bilaterally swollen and replaced by white mass lesions. A mass lesion was found in the left frontal lobe of the cerebrum. Histologically, neoplastic lymphocytes extensively involved the peripheral nerves. Immunohistochemically, most neoplastic lymphocytes were positive for CD20.</p>
