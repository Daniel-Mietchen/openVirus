<p>The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence and anatomical characteristics of lumbosacral congenital vertebral malformations (CVM) in French bulldogs, English bulldogs and Pugs presenting for problems unrelated to spinal disease. Furthermore, a possible association of these CVMs to the degree of tail malformation was investigated.</p>
