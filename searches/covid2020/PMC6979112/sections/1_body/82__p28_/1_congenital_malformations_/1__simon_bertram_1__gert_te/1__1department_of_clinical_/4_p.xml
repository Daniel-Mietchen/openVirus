<p>As previously described, CVMs are a common finding especially in the thoracic vertebral column of these three breeds, but this also seems to be true for the lumbosacral vertebral column. These anatomical variances need to be considered carefully when planning for neurosurgical and neurodiagnostic procedures. Furthermore, this study suggests a possible link between degree of tail malformation and presence of hemivertebrae. The clinical relevance of this needs to be further investigated and this could potentially be used to establish breeding guidelines to reduce the prevalence of hemivertebrae.</p>
