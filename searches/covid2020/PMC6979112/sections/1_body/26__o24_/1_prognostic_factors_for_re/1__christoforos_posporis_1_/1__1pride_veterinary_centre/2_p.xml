<p>Medical records of dogs diagnosed with isolated ONUA or with meningoencephalitis of unknown aetiology (MUA)‐associated ON were reviewed. Statistical analysis investigated the association between recovery of vision and the duration of blindness prior to immunosuppression, presence/absence of PLR, presence/absence of menace response, and CSF results. Datasets were tested for normality using the Shapiro‐Wilk test. All data was nonparametric. The datasets were compared using the Mann‐Whitney and the Kruskall Wallis test.</p>
