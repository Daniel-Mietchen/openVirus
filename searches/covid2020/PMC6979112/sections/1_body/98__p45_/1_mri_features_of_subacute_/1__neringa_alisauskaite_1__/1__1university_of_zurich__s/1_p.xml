<p>Laminar cortical necrosis is a consequence of severe hypoxic, ischaemic or hypoglycaemic event in the brain, occurring in the most vulnerable cerebral cortical layers. In humans, MRI features follow a consistent temporal course. In the late subacute stage, lesions in the cortex are of increased T2‐ signal‐intensity (SI) and of increased T1‐SI due to accumulation of denatured proteins or lipid laden macrophages. The lesions undergo variable contrast enhancement. Limited information reporting MRI findings is available in dogs affected by laminar cortical necrosis.</p>
