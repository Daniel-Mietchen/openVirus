<p>A 3‐year‐old Belgian shepherd dog was referred 8 days after sudden onset of blindness following general anaesthesia for a dental procedure. Neurological examination showed bilateral central blindness and mild ataxia. A 3‐Tesla MRI examination of the brain revealed bilateral non‐symmetrical areas of T2 and FLAIR increased SI within the occipital, parietal, temporal and frontal cortex, involving grey and white matter. Furthermore, linear T1‐hyperintense lesions were found in the cerebral cortex of the same areas undergoing moderate, heterogeneous contrast enhancement. Presence of increased SI in DWI with low ADC values demonstrated restricted diffusion in the affected cortical grey matter.</p>
