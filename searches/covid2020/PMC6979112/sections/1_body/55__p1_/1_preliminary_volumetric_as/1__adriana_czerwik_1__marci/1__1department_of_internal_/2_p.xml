<p>The study was carried on 19 Border collies divided into two groups: A; dogs with confirmed IE (n=10) and B; dogs with no history of seizures and normal brain MRI (n=9). Forty 3D‐T1‐weighted MRI images (TR 25; TE 4.8; FS 1.5; voxel size 0.75x 0.75x 0.375mm) of the brain were assessed and the volume of the left and right temporal lobe (ROI, cm
 <sup>3</sup>) was segmented using a semi‐automatic method (OsiriX 8, Switzerland).
