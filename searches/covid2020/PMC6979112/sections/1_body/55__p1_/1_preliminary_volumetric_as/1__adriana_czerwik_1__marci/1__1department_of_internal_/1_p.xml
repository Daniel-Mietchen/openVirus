<p>Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases in humans and dogs. In humans, there is some evidence that temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by abnormalities in the hippocampus, but also in brain regions that extend beyond it (amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus). To date, volumetric assessment of the temporal structures has not been performed in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy (IE). Hence, the aim of the study was to carry out a preliminary volumetric assessment of the temporal lobes in dogs with IE.</p>
