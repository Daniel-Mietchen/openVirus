<p>A statistical analysis carried out using the student t‚Äêtest revealed no significant differences in the lobe volumes between the groups (p&gt;0.05). The interhemispheric lobe ratio was calculated (smaller volume/larger volume) in all the animals and a mean was calculated for group B. Nine of the 10 animals in group A had a larger lobe ratio than the mean value of group B.</p>
