<p>Miniature Dachshunds are at a high risk of developing thoracolumbar intervertebral disc extrusion (TL‐IVDE). Predisposing factors including body condition score (BCS) have been identified, but the effect of BCS on outcome has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of BCS on rate of recovery and outcome of miniature Dachshunds having undergone hemilaminectomy surgery for treatment of TL‐IVDE.</p>
