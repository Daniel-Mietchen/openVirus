<p>This was a prospective observational study including 37 miniature Dachshunds diagnosed with surgical TL‐IVDE. Along with patient variables, a BCS (1‐9) and open field score (OFS, 0‐14) was recorded preoperatively for each dog. Postoperatively OFS was recorded for each day of hospitalisation, as well as at 4‐week re‐examination. Outcome was recorded as overall OFS change over 4 weeks, OFS change per day of hospitalisation and number of days hospitalised. Institutional ethical approval was received.</p>
