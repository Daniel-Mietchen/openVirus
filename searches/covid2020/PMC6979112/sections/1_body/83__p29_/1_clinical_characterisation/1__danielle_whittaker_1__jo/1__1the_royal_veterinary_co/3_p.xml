<p>Questionnaires were completed for 177 Welsh Terriers in the study. Paroxysmal episodes were reported in 76 (42.9%), of which 44 (24.9%) were classified as PD based on owner description and video footage where available. Episodes were characterised by limb dystonia (n=37, 84%), writhing movements with abnormal body posture (n=17, 39%) and occasionally abnormal head posture (n=4, 9%), with preserved consciousness. Median age at onset of signs was 57 months (range 8‐156), with no sex predisposition (P=0.60). Median frequency of episodes was 2 per month (range 0.1‐30). Stress, excitement or exercise was the most frequent suspected precipitating factor (n=8, 18%), although most occurred at rest (n=31, 70%) and owners could not predict them. Of owners that could comment, most dogs displayed a stable (40%) or improving (32%) clinical course, with owner‐perceived quality of life typically unaffected (n=28, 66%).</p>
