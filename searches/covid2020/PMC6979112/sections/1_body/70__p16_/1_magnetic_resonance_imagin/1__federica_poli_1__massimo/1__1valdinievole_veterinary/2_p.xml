<p>A 3 year old female Golden Retriever was referred after a sudden onset of tonic clonic seizures. The dog showed a stuporous state on admission and the neurological examination was consistent with a multifocal intracranial neurolocalization. Blood exams were unremarkable while the MRI showed symmetrical bilateral T2 hyperintense lesions in the caudate nuclei and girus cinguli. The lesions were isointense in T1W images and showed a mild contrast enhancement and a mild mass effect. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not show significant abnormalities. The gastric content was toxicologically tested and found to be positive for metaldehyde screening. Thus, a diagnosis of metaldehyde intoxication was made. The dog progressively recovered to normal within 7 days with antiepileptic and supportive therapy. A 2 month‐follow up MRI showed small, symmetrically well defined bilateral lesions in the caudate nuclei with a hyperintense signal in T2W images and a hypointense signal in T1W images, which were interpreted as cavitated lesions. The girus cinguli lesions were not detected on the follow up MRI and were thought to be postictal lesions.</p>
