<p>The current case report underlines the importance of early onset of treatment in immediate and early PTE and the difficulty of preventive treatment of late PTE. Two dogs were presented after traumatic brain injury (TBI), a Jack Russell Terrier (JRT) kicked by a horse and a Magyar Vizsla (MV) hit by train. Both dogs developed seizures immediately after the trauma and were successfully treated for one month (JRT) with Imepitoin and for half a year (MV) with Phenobarbital. Both dogs had no seizures during the whole treatment period. However, after discontinuing the application of AEDs by the owners both dogs developed seizures, leading to death of the JRT in status epilepticus. The MV was treated again with AEDs (Phenobarbital, Imepitoin, Levetiracetam, Potassium bromide), but continued to have cluster seizures every two weeks.</p>
