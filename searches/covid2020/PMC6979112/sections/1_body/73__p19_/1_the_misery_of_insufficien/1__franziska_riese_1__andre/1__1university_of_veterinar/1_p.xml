<p>Posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) is well described in human and veterinary medicine. Immediate, early and late PTE are known in men and dogs. The recommended treatment period with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) after head trauma is about seven days in human medicine including immediate and early PTE. Up to now standardized protocols for treatment to prevent PTE in dogs are not available.</p>
