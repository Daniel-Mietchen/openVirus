<p>The influence of diets have been studied extensively in human epilepsy, however, there is a lack of comparative data in veterinary medicine. It has been shown that a medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT) enriched diet has a positive effect on seizure control and behaviour in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy. However, it is unknown whether MCTs administered in the form of an add‐on dietary supplement (DS) to a variable base diet will show similar positive effects.</p>
