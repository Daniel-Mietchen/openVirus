<p>A 6‐month multi‐centre, prospective, randomised, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled cross‐over trial was completed, comparing a MCT‐DS with a standardised placebo‐DS in a population of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy, chronically treated with antiepileptic drugs and reaching tier‐2 diagnostic certainty. A 9%‐MCT or placebo oil was added to the dogs’ diet for three months, followed by the alternative oil for a further three months. Twenty‐eight dogs completed this study and were included in further analysis. Seizure frequency was significantly lower when dogs were fed MCT‐DS (median 2.51/month, 0‐6.67/month) in comparison with the placebo‐DS (2.67/month, 0–10.45/month; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0147). Seizure day frequency was also significantly lower during MCT‐DS phase (1.68/month, 0‐5.60/month vs. 1.99/month, 0–7.42/month, 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0101). Two dogs achieved seizure‐freedom, three additional dogs had ≥50% reduction and 12 had &lt;50% reduction in seizure frequency. Eight dogs showed no response or a slight increase (8%).
