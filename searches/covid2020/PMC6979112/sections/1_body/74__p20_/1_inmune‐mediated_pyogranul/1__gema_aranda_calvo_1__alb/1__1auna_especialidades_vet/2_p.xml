<p>Common causes of ganglioneuritis and root enlargement in small animals are neoplastic, infectious or immune‐mediated; therefore, it is paramount to achieve a definitive diagnosis through the analysis of histopathological samples. In our case, the biopsy revealed a pyogranulomatous inflammation without evidence of infectious agents suggesting an immune‐mediated process, and reinforced by the response to immunosuppression. Immune‐mediated pyogranulomatous ganglioneuritis should be considered in the differential diagnoses of enlarged spinal ganglia in cats.</p>
