<p>Epilepsy is the most common chronic brain disease in dogs. Currently, seizures are considered spontaneous due to lack of understanding of the transition between the inter‚Äêictal and the ictal stages. In humans, prodromal activity (e.g. change in behaviour or mood) and seizure triggers have been reported, however this is yet to be explored in dogs. A better understanding of these factors may improve our understanding of epilepsy and enhance management options.</p>
