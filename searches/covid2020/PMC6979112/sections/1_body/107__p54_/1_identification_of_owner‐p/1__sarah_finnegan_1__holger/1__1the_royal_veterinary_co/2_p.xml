<p>We designed an online questionnaire‐based study to identify whether owners believe they can predict forthcoming seizure activity in their dog, to report observed pre‐seizure changes and seizure triggers. Owners of 228 dogs with Tier I idiopathic epilepsy completed the survey, with 136 (60%) reporting that they could predict an upcoming seizure. The top three reported prodromal activities were increased clinginess, restlessness and signs of fear behaviour. The majority of owners detected these clinical signs at least 5 minutes before seizure activity, and up to 1 week before. No significant association was found between reported prodromal behaviour and breed or age. Triggers were less frequently reported, with stress, food and excitement being the most commonly reported. No significant association was found between triggers and breed or age.</p>
