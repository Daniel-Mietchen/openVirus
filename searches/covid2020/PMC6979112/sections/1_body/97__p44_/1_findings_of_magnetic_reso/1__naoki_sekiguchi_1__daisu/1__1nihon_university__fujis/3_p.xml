<p>There were significant relations between length of CSF line deficits and severity (P=0.002). However, no significant correlation between area of the spinal cord and length of CSF line deficit, and area of the disc material and the length were observed. In two dogs with progressive myelomalacia, L2 ratio were 20.7 and 20.5, longer than those in parapregic dogs without symptom of the myelomalacia (mean 5.47).</p>
