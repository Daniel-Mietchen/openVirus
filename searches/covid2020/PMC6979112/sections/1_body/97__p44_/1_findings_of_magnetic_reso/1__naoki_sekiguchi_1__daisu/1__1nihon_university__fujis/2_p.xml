<p>Thirty‐four dogs with IVDD were included in this study. MRM were obtained after conventional MRI scan. In all dogs, area of the spinal cord and extruded disc material at lesion site were measured on T2‐weighted transverse images and neurological severity were obtained from medical record. The length of CSF line deficits was measured on MRM and L2 ratio was calculated from the length of deficit and L2 vertebrae. Relation between deficits of the line and severity, and correlation between the areas and severity were statistically analyzed.</p>
