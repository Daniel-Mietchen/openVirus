<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common in dogs and can be life‐threatening. However, determining the prognosis upon presentation is difficult. Recently, we reported the development of a scoring system, dubbed KCTS, which may aid in predicting prognosis in dogs following head trauma. This 0‐7 point scale is based on abnormal head CT findings. The aim of the current study was to validate the prognostic value of this score.</p>
