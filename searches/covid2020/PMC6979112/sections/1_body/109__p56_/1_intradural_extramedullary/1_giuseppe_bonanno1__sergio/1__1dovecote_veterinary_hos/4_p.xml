<p>The dog underwent left‐sided dorsolateral hemilaminectomy between C6 and C7. The lesion was found to be intradural and so was debulked via durotomy and sent for histopathological examination. The dog recovered well from surgery and was ambulatory within 3 weeks. The diagnosis from histopathology was an osteosarcoma. Chemotherapy consisting of 10mg/kg of carboplatin intravenously every three weeks was started post‐operatively. The dog remains ataxic six months post‐operatively but with a good quality of life.</p>
