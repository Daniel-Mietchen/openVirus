<p>Forebrain lesions were consistently present (90%). About 50% had additional lesions in thalamus and brainstem. Interestingly, cerebellum was involved in 30%. Without brain biopsy, 3 dogs with a focal lesion and normal CSF would have been more suspicious for neoplasia than for encephalitis. Brain biopsy here showed that immune‚Äêmediated encephalitis can also present with focal lesions, without CSF changes or albuminocytologic dissociation only.</p>
