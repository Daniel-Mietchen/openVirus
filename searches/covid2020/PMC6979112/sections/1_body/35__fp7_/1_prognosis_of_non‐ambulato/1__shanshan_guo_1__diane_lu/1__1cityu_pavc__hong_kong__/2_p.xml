<p>Medical records of 185 dogs, which had undergone single or multiple VSD based on clinical signs (non‐ambulatory tetraparesis/plegia) and MRI results between January 2010 and September 2016 at a single veterinary practice were reviewed. Data about signalment, preoperative neurological status, intervertebral disc(s) involved, outcome (good: ambulatory, fair: ambulatory but with perceivable neurological deficit, poor: non‐ambulatory or perioperative death), time to recovery (TTR), and neurological status at the ‘last seen’ date were collected.</p>
