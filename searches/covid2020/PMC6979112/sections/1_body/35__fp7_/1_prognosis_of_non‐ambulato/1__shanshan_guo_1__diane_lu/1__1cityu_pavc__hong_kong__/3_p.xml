<p>59.5% of all dogs experienced a good outcome, 36.7% had a fair and 3.8% a poor outcome. Median TTR was 3 days. 66.5% of dogs required SVSD and 33.5% MVSD. There was a significant difference between those two groups in age (SVSD: M=112.6 months and MVSD: M=133.2 months; t‐test, p&lt;0.001) and breed size (χ2 test, p=0.006), small breeds were more likely to require MSVD than medium or large breeds. No significant differences were found for sex, neuter status, outcome (χ2 tests: p=0.158, p=0.573, and p=0.816, respectively) and TTR (Mann‐Whitney‐U, p=0.166). Controlling for age and breed, belonging to the SVSD or MSVD group was not associated with the outcome.</p>
