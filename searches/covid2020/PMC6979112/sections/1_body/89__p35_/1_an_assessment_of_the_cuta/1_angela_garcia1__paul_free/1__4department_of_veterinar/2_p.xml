<p>Inclusion criteria were neurologically normal cats older than 6 months with a normal hydration status and no history of neurological or orthopedic disease. Cats underwent a subjective assessment of stress level and were categorised into ‘relaxed’, ‘stressed’ or ‘very stressed’, with the latter group being excluded. An ECVN boarded neurologist assessed the cats and performed a neurological examination including assessment of mentation, gait, postural reactions, patellar reflex, and CTR. Any cat showing neurological abnormalities other than CTR abnormalities was excluded. Age, stress level and CTR results were recorded. CTR was defined as normal, if easy to elicit and present bilaterally, or abnormal if difficult to elicit or absent.</p>
