<p>The cutaneous trunci reflex (CTR) is an important part of the neurological examination and yet it can be very inconsistent in cats. Although there are studies investigating the CTR in dogs, there is a gap in the feline literature. We aimed to evaluate the reliability of the CTR in neurologically normal cats, and investigate if stress or age had any influence. This study has welfare and ethical approval.</p>
