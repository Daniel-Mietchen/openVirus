<p>Spinal cord injury can lead to paralysis and urinary incontinence in people and animals. Supra‐sacral injuries lead to bladder over‐activity characterised by frequent involuntary emission of urine and lack of bladder distension awareness. Currently, no satisfactory method exists to monitor the detrusor activity, that could be used to either block the onset of ‘reflex bladder contractions’ (
 <italic>i.e</italic>. neuromodulation) or to ‘inform’ the patient of the level of bladder fullness.
