<p>Past research has used hook or microchannel electrodes on teased sacral nerves in anesthetised rodents, but faced major obstacles in large animals: (i) afferent bladder signals were masked by electrical noise and bioelectric interference from other organs; and (ii) electrode implantation led to nerve damage and high impedance, preventing recordings.</p>
