<p>We have designed a new nerve interface, multi‐electrode cuff (from silicone with steel electrodes), connected to a Cooper cable for signal extraction. The cuff design is based on the anatomy of sheep sacral nerves. Using this implant, we have conducted impedance measurements following stimulation of explanted pig vagal nerves. This showed impedance values of ~5kΩ for frequencies ranging 100‐1,000Hz, which fulfils theoretical requirements for afferent bladder sacral nerve recording. This cuff contains up to 10 electrodes to exploit the method of velocity selective recording, a powerful technique to discriminate various afferent fibres based on their conduction velocity. In particular, we plan to use this device in a sheep model, in which bladder afferents coding for pressure and volume of the urinary bladder are similar to man, ~38 and 41 m/s respectively.</p>
