<p>Four dogs with histopathologically confirmed glioma previously resected with curative intent followed by adjuvant temozolamide developed tumour recurrence and underwent reintervention. Gross total resection of tumor recurrence was performed using the same previous approach. After the second resection, temozalomide was replaced by toceranib (2.5‐2.8 mg/kg 3 times weekly) except in one dog (case 1) treated with lomustine after her third surgery (70mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>/3 weeks).
