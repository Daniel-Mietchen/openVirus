<p>75 dogs met the inclusion criteria, among them 40 had ESS and 10 PE. Three dogs developed drug resistant epilepsy. Dogs with ESS were younger, more frequently presented with abnormal mental status and had significantly shorter survival times. They also showed cortical involvement (in particular temporal and parietal lobes), features of increased intracranial pressure and meningeal contrast enhancement more frequently on MRI when compared with dogs without seizures. On multivariate regression analysis the factors associated with PE were presence of ESS (p=0.034) and MRI lesions in hippocampus (p = 0.014) and temporal lobe (p = 0.026).</p>
