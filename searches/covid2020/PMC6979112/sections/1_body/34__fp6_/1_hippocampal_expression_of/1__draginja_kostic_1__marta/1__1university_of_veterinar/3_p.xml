<p>CB1 receptor expression was confirmed in the hippocampus of all dogs. In CA1 the area expressing CB1 receptor was smaller in patients with idiopathic as compared to patients with structural epilepsy (p&lt;0.0001) or healthy dogs (p&lt;0.001). In the same region, intensity of the CB1 receptor staining was stronger in dogs with idiopathic than structural epilepsy (p&lt;0.001). Statistically significant group differences with smaller area and higher intensity of CB1 receptor expression in idiopathic epilepsy dogs in comparison to structural epilepsy occurred in DG, CA3 and hilus.</p>
