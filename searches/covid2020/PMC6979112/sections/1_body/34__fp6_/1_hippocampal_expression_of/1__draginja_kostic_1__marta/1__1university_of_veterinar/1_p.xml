<p>In epilepsy, the endocannabinoid system could be involved in the pathomechanism through the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). The CB1 receptor is known to control neuronal activity on the synaptic level by negative feedback mechanism. Endocannabinoids are elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in epileptic dogs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe CB1 receptors in epileptic patients and quantitatively compare them to healthy dogs.</p>
