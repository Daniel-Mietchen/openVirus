<p>The blood work‐up was unremarkable except for mildly increased lactate levels in two cats. MRI of brain and spinal cord as well as cerebrospinal fluid of all cats were unremarkable. Diffusely mild to moderate pathologic spontaneous activity occurred in electromyographic examinations. Motor and sensory nerve conduction studies were normal in peroneal, fibular, ulnar and radial nerves, but repetitive motor nerve stimulation with 1 and 2 Hz revealed a decrement of up to 73%. Brainstem auditory evoked responses showed physiological wave I, III, V latencies. Muscle biopsies revealed mild myofiber diameter changes and diffusely increased nuclear internalization, mitochondrial prominence and clustered myofibres with decreased COX and NADH‐TR reactivities. On electron microscopy, all cats displayed conspicuous sarcoplasmic phospholipid membrane inclusions. Levels of organic acids in urine, and aminoacids and acylcarnitin in serum were comparable to healthy age matched control cats.</p>
