<p>Degenerative Lumbosacral Stenosis (DLSS) is an acquired multifactorial condition affecting dogs. Different treatments modalities are available with surgery appearing to provide a better outcome. Lumbosacral epidural‚Äêsteroid injection (ESI) has been described in a single previous study in dogs. ESI provides a more targeted therapy than oral medication, being applied closer to the affected nerve roots avoiding systemic effects. These advantages allied with rapid response to treatment, gives ESI the potential of being utilised as a predictive test for subsequent surgical management outcome.</p>
