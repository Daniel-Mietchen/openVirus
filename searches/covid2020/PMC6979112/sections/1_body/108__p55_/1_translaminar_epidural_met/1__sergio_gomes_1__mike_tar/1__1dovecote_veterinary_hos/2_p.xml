<p>A prospective study was undertaken of 9 dogs presented with DLSS over one year. All patients underwent advanced imaging including CT and MRI for confirmation of a diagnosis of DLSS and an ESI before surgical management. Decompressive surgery included a combination of uni/bilateral foraminotomy and dorsal laminectomy. Seven out of 9 patients improved following ESI, and 3/9 had a complete resolution of clinical signs. In all patients improvement was short‐lived, with recurrence within 3 to 18 days. After decompressive surgery all patients improved, of which 4/9 had a complete resolution of clinical signs.</p>
