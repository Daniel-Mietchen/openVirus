<p>Post‐op opioid sparing techniques are being emphasized in human medicine. Modern anesthesia is shifting to a reliance on topical anesthetics, NSAIDs and NMDA antagonists to achieve adequate post‐operative analgesia. Such protocols decrease medication related side effects, shorten hospitalization and enhance quality of post‐operative recovery. The use of local anesthetics (LAs) has the most evidence‐based support as a perioperative analgesic in veterinary medicine. Liposomal bupivacaine has been developed as long acting LA to provide extended release action over 72 hours. Extensive studies have validated the local and systemic safety of NOCITA® in dogs: It has been shown to not migrate from its site of application and has been documented to be safe and efficacious following epidural, perineural, and intraneural injections. NOCITA® has the potential to provide valuable and safe opioid sparing post‐operative analgesia following spinal surgery.</p>
