<p>Seventy cats were included. Fifty‚Äêfive of 61 cats (90%) for which this information was available, regained voluntary urinary function. Higher neurological grade was significantly associated with poor urinary outcome (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) and longer time to regain voluntary urinary control (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.0003). No significant associations were found between urinary outcome and age, sex, anal tone, perineal sensation, tail base sensation, degree of craniocaudal or dorsoventral sacrocaudal displacement, concurrent orthopaedic injury, tail amputation, faecal function at diagnosis, and survival. Patients that could defaecate voluntarily had longer survival times than patients that lacked voluntary control over defaecation (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.03).
