<p>In the current study, a prospective ongoing trial, horses were examined using standardized diagnostic procedures to differentiate symptomatic headshaking (SHS) from IHS. In all patients, SNC of the infraorbital nerve was measured bilaterally under general anesthesia. Sensory nerve conduction velocity, amplitude of the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and stimulation threshold were recorded. The technique described by Aleman et al. 2013 had to be modified to minimize artefacts. All examinations were performed with written owner consent according to university guidelines.</p>
