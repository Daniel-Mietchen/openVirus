<p>Twelve horses with equine headshaking were included: two with SHS and 10 with IHS. In total, 22 measurements were obtained. In the horses with SHS, SNAP were evoked at 15mA (left side) and 20 mA (right side), as well as at 7.5mA bilaterally. In horses with presumed IHS, the median threshold was 10 mA (5 mA ‚Äê 15 mA). Despite small subdermal hemorrhage no major side effects or deterioration of clinical signs were detected after the measurements.</p>
