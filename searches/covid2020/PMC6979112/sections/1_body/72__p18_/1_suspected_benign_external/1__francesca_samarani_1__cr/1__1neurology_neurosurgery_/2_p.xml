<p>A 4 month‐old, male Chihuahua was presented for a month history of behavioral changes, right circling and tetraparesis that had acutely worsened to severely depressed mental status and non‐ambulatory tetraparesis following a traumatic event. An evident dome‐shaped calvarium was noticed on physical examination at presentation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT and ultrasound of the brain demonstrated a generalized, moderate widening of the subarachnoid space between the skull and the neocortex and a moderate enlargement of the lateral ventricles. A small CSF sample obtained from the open fontanel was xanthochromic and displayed mild mononuclear pleocitosis with eritrophagocytosis, consistent with a previous haemorrhage. No organisms were apparent on cytopathological evaluation. The dog improved with medical treatment only. Treatment consisted of supportive care and one week of antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs for the traumatic lesions. Five months after the diagnosis the owner reported that the animal has suddenly died. Necropsy was not allowed.</p>
