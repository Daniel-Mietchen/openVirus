<p>External hydrocephalus in infants is a benign clinical entity in which macrocephaly is associated with an increase in volume of the subarachnoid space because of excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is considered a self‚Äêlimiting condition and is therefore rarely treated. Only a few cases have been published in veterinary medicine and all but one were surgically treated. And the only canine case reported of external hydrocephalus was diagnosed with computed tomography (CT) images only.</p>
