<p>A seven year old, male, castrated Chihuahua presented for further investigations of acute onset generalised tonic‚Äêclonic epileptic seizures with a progressive increase in frequency. Additionally, the dog exhibited frequent sudden head and body movements characterised by myoclonic jerks which could be triggered by bright light, loud noises and by approaching towards his head. Comprehensive blood tests (haematology, biochemistry, electrolytes and BAST) revealed no significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were largely unremarkable.</p>
