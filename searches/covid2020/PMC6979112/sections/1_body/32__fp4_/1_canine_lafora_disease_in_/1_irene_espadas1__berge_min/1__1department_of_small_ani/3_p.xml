<p>As per previous studies, LD genetic testing was performed by Southern blotting and membrane pre‚Äêhydridisation specific for the specific DNA fragment to EPMB2. A population of six Chihuahua dogs were also genetically tested and used as a control group. All blood samples were obtained in accordance to the University of Liverpool Committee on Research Ethics (VREC589). Genetic testing revealed one homozygous/affected case and within the control group three carriers and three cases with wild type alleles. This is the first description of genetically confirmed Lafora disease in a Chihuahua dog.</p>
