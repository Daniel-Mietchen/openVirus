<p>Seizure‐precipitating factors have not been thoroughly studied in epileptic dogs, although they are frequently reported in human epilepsy patients. In humans, common seizure‐precipitating factors include for example stress, sleep deprivation and infectious diseases. We hypothesized that seizure‐precipitating factors are common in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy, and the occurrence of these factors associate with the patients’ signalment, personality, and epilepsy‐related factors. Furthermore, we hypothesized that most dogs with idiopathic epilepsy have protective factors for seizures.</p>
