<p>In our study population the prevalence of seizure‐precipitating factors was 74% and the most frequently reported factors included stress‐related situations, sleep deprivation, weather, and hormonal factors. Almost all of the studied dogs had both precipitated and unprecipitated seizures. Most commonly the seizure occurred within 24 h of exposure to the precipitating factor. In dogs with focal onset seizures, the number of precipitating factors was 1.9 times higher compared to dogs with generalized seizures. Additionally, 60% of owners recognized at least one protective factor for seizures.</p>
