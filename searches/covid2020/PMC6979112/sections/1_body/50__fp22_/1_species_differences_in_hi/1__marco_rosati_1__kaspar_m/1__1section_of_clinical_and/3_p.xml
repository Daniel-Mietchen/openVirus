<p>SLC7A11 indeed presents with distinct expression patterns in each species. The hippocampal expression in the rat was in general very weak while staining intensity suggests predominant neocortical expression. In contrast, clear bands of SLC7A11 expression were seen in molecular layer and alveus of the feline hippocampus. Canine brains displayed more widely distributed immunoreactivity in molecular layer, stratum oriens and stratum radiatum up to CA4‐CA2 with subsequent involvement of the entire pyramidal cell layer in the remaining regions up to subiculum. In non‐human primates, the molecular layer of dentate gyrus is spared, while stratum oriens and radiatum of CA3 and CA4 stain strongly immunopositive.</p>
