<p>Glutamate is the most important epilepsy‚Äêassociated excitatory neurotransmitter and renders brain regions as the hippocampus particularly vulnerable to excitotoxicity. Recently increased expression of the cysteine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11 has been identified to correlate with seizure incidence in structural epilepsy due to glutamate induced excitotoxicity and subsequent neuronal injury.</p>
