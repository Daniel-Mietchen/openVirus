<p>The purpose of this study is to describe spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) in three Greyhounds treated conservatively. SSDH is a vascular disorder causing compression of the spinal cord and acute onset of neurological symptoms. In veterinary medicine this pathological condition is poorly documented. One case of SSDH in a Greyhound has been published.</p>
