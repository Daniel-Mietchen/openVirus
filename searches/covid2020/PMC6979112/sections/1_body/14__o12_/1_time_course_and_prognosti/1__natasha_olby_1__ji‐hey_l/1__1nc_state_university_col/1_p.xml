<p>Prediction of outcome following acute, severe spinal cord injury in dogs is difficult due to variable recovery. Serum biomarkers show promise as prognostic tools but their concentrations change over time. The purpose of this study was to describe the time course of serum concentrations of glial (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP, and S100β) and neuronal (phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, pNF‐H) biomarkers after severe spinal cord injury in dogs. We hypothesized that combinations of these biomarkers would predict outcome in deep pain negative (DPN) dogs with surgically treated thoracolumbar intervertebral disc extrusion (TL‐IVDE).</p>
