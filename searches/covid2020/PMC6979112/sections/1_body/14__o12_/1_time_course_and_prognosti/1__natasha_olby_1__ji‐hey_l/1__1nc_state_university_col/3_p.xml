<p>Thirty‐one dogs were included, 19/31 (62%) recovered independent ambulation by 6 months. GFAP and S100β concentrations peaked within 3 days and rapidly decreased. PNF‐H peaked at 14 days and was still detectable at 8 weeks. A GFAP concentration of &lt;0.31ng/mL within 72 hours of onset of paralysis predicted outcome with an accuracy of 0.84.</p>
