<p>Pituitary tumors (PT) may cause neurological dysfunction by compressing/invading the adjacent central nervous system structures. However, consistent data regarding the detailed neurological presentation of dogs with PT are lacking. Hence, the purpose of the study is to provide a detailed description of the neurological abnormalities in a large population of dogs with a suspected pituitary detectable mass and relate them with the size of the mass using the pituitary height/brain area ratio.</p>
