<p>The study included 97 dogs. All dogs showed at least one neurological abnormality, the most common being abnormal mentation (79%), abnormal gait (61%) and cranial nerves deficits (44%) . Out of these, abnormal postural and proprioceptive reactions (48%), head and cervical pain and/or hyperesthesia (25%) and postural abnormalities (21%) have not been previously reported. The majority of dogs with a pituitary detectable mass had signs of brain compression. The presence of an high pituitary height/brain area and brain compression represented a risk factor for developing mental status abnormalities.</p>
