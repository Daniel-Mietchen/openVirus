<p>On MRI, diffuse T2W and STIR signal hyperintensity extended bilaterally over the longissimus and iliocostalis muscles from the T5 to L7 vertebrae. These were mildly hyperintense on T1W and strongly contrast enhancing. Gradient echo images showed no signs suggestive of haemorrhage. The muscles were markedly swollen. No other muscle groups were affected. The changes were consistent with muscle oedema, attributed to exertional myopathy. Myoglobinuria was not present. This dog made a full recovery following 2 weeks of rest and analgesia, and remained normal with a follow‐up period of 8 months.</p>
