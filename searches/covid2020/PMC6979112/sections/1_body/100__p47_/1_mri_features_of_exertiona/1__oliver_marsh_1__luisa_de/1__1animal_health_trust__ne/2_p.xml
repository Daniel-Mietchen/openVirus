<p>This dog's exercise was exclusively lead walking, but she escaped and ran for four miles, developing severe pain, unresponsive to carprofen, tramadol and prednisolone, but responsive to gabapentin. Serum creatinine kinase was markedly elevated. The dog was presented to us one week after the incident, and pain was elicited on palpation of the thoracolumbar spine.</p>
