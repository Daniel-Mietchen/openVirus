<p>In seven dogs with IVD, swelling of the reuniting duct were observed in affected side, while those structure were thought to be normal in unaffected side. In all dogs with idiopathic epilepsy, those structure were assessed as normal. The sensitivity of swelling of the reuniting duct on MR cisternograpy in IVD was 77.8% and specificity was 81.0%. There was no significant differences in the volume of the vestibular structure between affected and unaffected side.</p>
