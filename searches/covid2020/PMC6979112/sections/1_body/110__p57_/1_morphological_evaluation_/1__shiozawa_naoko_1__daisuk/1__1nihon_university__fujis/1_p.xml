<p>Although endolymphatic hydrops of the internal ear and vestibular neuritis are suspected, the cause of idiopathic vestibular disorder (IVD) in dog is unknown. In human patients with Meniere's disease (MD), which is thought similar to IVD, extended reuniting duct of the vestibular was observed in affected side on MR cisternography. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the morphology of the vestibular structures on MR cisternography in dogs with IVD which did not show any abnormality on conventional MR images.</p>
