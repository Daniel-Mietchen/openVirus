<p>This study suggested that morphological changes in the vestibular structures had occurred in dogs with IVD similar to human MD because abnormal swelling of the reuniting duct was observed. Measured volume of the vestibular was not significantly different between lesion and unaffected side because the structure was too small to precisely measure the volume.</p>
