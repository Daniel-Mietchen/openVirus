<p>The ivory vertebra sign is defined as uniform sclerosis of a vertebral body, with no alterations in size or contours and no change in the adjacent intervertebral disks. In human medicine, the most common cause is sclerotic metastatic bone disease (prostate, breast and lung cancer). Other differential diagnoses are Paget's disease, lymphoma or osteomyelitis. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first report of a dog with changes in the vertebra similar to ivory vertebra in humans causing spinal compression in a dog.</p>
