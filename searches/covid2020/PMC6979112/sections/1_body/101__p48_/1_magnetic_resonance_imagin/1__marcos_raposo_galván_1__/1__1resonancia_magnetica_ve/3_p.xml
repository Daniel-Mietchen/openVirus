<p>MRI sequences of the brain showed a large retrocerebellar fluid accumulation associated with an enlarged fourth ventricle. These findings were associated with cerebellar hypoplasia and partial atrophy/absence of the caudal portion of cerebellar vermis. CSF analysis was performed and was unremarkable. PCR analysis of Toxoplasma and Coronavirus was negative in CSF. After 3 months of diagnosis, clinical signs were similar with a good quality of life. Similar MRI findings have been reported in Dandy‚ÄêWalker malformation in dogs or inferior cerebellar hypoplasia in purebred Eurasier dogs.</p>
