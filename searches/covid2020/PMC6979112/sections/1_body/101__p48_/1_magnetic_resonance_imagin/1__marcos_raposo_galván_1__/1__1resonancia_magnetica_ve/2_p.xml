<p>A 8‐month‐old male Domestic Shorthair cat was referred for an uncoordinated gait seen by the owners since birth. General physical examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed generalized ataxia with hypermetria of all four limbs, wide‐based standing, and intermittent intention head tremors. Neurological examination was consistent with a cerebellar lesion. Hematology, full biochemistry and FeLV/FIV serology did not reveal abnormalities.</p>
