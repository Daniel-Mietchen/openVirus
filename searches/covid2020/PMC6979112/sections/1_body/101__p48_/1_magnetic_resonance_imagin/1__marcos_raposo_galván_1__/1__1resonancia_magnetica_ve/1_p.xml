<p>The Dandy‐Walker malformation complex refers to a group of congenital central nervous system malformations that primarily involve the cerebellum and adjacent tissues. This malformation consists of complete or partial agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, cystic malformation of the fourth ventricle and an enlargement of the caudal fossa. In some cases, substantial enlargement of the caudal fossa is not observed and is referred to as Dandy‐Walker variant. To the author's knowledge this kind of malformation has not been reported yet in cats.</p>
