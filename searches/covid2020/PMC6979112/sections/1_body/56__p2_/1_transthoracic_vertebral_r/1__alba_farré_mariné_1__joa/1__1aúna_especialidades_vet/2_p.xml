<p>We describe six dogs (from six months to four years old) with clinical thoracic hemivertebrae excluding other concomitant myelopathies, surgically corrected with the same technique of vertebral realignment and fixation, through a transthoracic approach (2013‐2018). Diagnosis was achieved with myelography (2), myeloCT (1), MRI (1), MRI and CT (1), MRI and myelography (1). A right CASPAR cervical distractor system (Aesculap Implant Systems, Germany) was used for the vertebral distraction and realignment, and cortical screws placed one to two vertebrae cranial and caudal to the malformation and embedded in polymethylmethacrylate. Clinical improvement without post‐op deterioration was achieved in all cases with two cases becoming neurologically normal. No complications were reported during the follow‐up period (7 months to 4.5 years).</p>
