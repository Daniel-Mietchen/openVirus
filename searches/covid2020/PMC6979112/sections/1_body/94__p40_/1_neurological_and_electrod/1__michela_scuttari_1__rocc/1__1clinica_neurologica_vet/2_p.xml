<p>A 1 year‐old hen was referred for a two‐weeks acute and non progressive history of abnormal gait in the left limb after being entangled in a wire fence. Neurological examination revealed ambulatory left limb monoparesis with dragging of the foot on the dorsal aspect. Postural reactions were absent in the left hindlimb and there was a marked reduction/absence of the left withdrawal, cranial tibial and gastrocnemius reflexes. Neurolocalization was left lumbosacral spinal cord segment, spinal nerve roots, spinal nerve and sciatic nerve. The asymmetry of the clinical signs and the history of trauma strongly suggested a left ischiatic nerve lesion.</p>
