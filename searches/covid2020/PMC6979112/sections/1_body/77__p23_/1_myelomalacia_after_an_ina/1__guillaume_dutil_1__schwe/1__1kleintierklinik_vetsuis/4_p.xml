<p>The cat was treated symptomatically for four days without improvement and was consequently euthanized. The findings of the 
 <italic>post mortem</italic> examination were consistent with a severe segmental hemorrhage and myelomalacia. Histopathology of the spinal cord after hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed a cavity containing some eosinophilic droplets at the edges that could be compatible with an injection trajectory. A necrotic area in the grey matter was also detected. The spinal cord changes were compatible with a traumatic lesion. However, in the surrounding structures no further evidence of blunt trauma, vertebral fracture, disk extrusion or injection was present.
