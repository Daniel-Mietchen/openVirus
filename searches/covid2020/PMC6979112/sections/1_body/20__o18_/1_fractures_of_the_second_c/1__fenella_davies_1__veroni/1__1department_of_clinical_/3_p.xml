<p>In the dog population, crossbreeds and Labrador Retrievers were the most represented. Mean age was 2.75â€‰years. Motor vehicle accident was the most common inciting cause, followed by frontal collision (running into an object). Neurological symptoms ranged from mere cervical pain with or without mild ataxia (n=22), to tetraparesis (n=28) and tetraplegia (n=11). Neither weight nor age, type of trauma, length of the axis (cm), or degree of clinical symptoms had an impact on the type of axis fracture seen. Concerning treatment, 54% of patients underwent surgical fracture stabilisation, 39% received conservative therapy and 7% were immediately euthanized. Functional motor recovery was achieved in 90% of all treated cases. Due to the low number of cases lacking functional motor recovery, no reliable predictive factors for outcome were detectable.</p>
