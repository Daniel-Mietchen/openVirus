<p id="Par31">Traditional phylodynamic analysis applied to nosocomial outbreaks has been successfully used in the past to identify the likely source; however, the inclusion of extensive patient data, such as treatment regimens, admission and discharge dates, and length of stay, can improve not only phylogenetic estimates but also the translation of the interpretation to public health policy. Epidemiological and genomic data on Methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) infections were recently utilized by Azarian and colleagues to reconstruct MRSA transmission and to estimate possible community and hospital acquisitions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Findings from this study revealed that as high as 70% of the MRSA colonization within the hospitalâ€™s neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was acquired within the NICU itself. These findings indicated that current, standard prevention efforts were insufficient in preventing an outbreak, calling for the improvement of current care or alternative implementation strategies.
