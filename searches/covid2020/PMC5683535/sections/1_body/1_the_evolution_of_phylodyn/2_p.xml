 <sup>st</sup> century, in particular, has witnessed unparalleled advances in methods and techniques for molecular sequence data generation and analyses. However, the relationship of progress and perfection is far from linear, along with its relationship to navigational ease. For example, phylodynamic inference has transitioned into a highly statistics-focused process with the corresponding challenges, including informative samples that can significantly affect the accuracy of results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Several research groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] have reviewed and/or demonstrated the impact of neglecting critical quality control steps on obtaining reliable inferences using the recently developed phylodynamic frameworks, particularly with high throughput, or next-generation, sequencing (NGS) data. Some important steps include ensuring uniform spatial and temporal sampling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], sufficient time duration between consecutive sample collections for observing measurable evolution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], coverage of deep sequencing, and consideration of genomic recombination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].
