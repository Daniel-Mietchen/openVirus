<p id="Par29">Although viral spread is often attributed to human mobility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], factors such as population growth and accessibility can also play an important role, as with the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) group M subtypes A and D in east Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] and circulating recombinant form (CRF) 02_AG in regions of the Congo River basin (CRB) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The democratic republic of Congo (DRC) has been reported to be the source of HIV-1 group M diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]; however, the epidemiological heterogeneity of CRF02_AG within surrounding regions comprising the CRB had remained a mystery since its discovery in 1994 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], with prevalence ranging from virtual non-existence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] to accounting for as high as 20% of infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], depending on the geographical location. The region with the highest proportion of CRF02_AG infections, Cameroon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], has been characterized by a rapidly growing infected population (0.5% in 1985 to 6% in 2008 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]), of which the majority (60%) is caused by this clade. Using both molecular sequence data and UNAIDS surveillance data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], the spatiotemporal origin of CRF02_AG was estimated to occur in the DRC in the early 1970s (1972–1975), with the rapid viral population growth in Cameroon following a chance exportation event out of DRC.
