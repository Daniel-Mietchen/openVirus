<p id="Par25">Combining pathogen genetic data with host population information (e.g., population density and air traffic) in a statistical framework is critical for the reliable assessment of factors potentially associated with pathogen population dynamics and geographic spread. The comparative phylogenetic approach described above [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] was used recently to identify potential determinants of the dengue virus (DENV) introduction to and spread within Brazil. Results from Nunes et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] suggested that for three DENV serotypes, the establishment of new lineages in Brazil had been occurring within 7 to 10-year intervals since their primary introduction in 1985, most likely from the Caribbean. Additionally, they observed that aerial transportation of humans and/or vector mosquitoes, rather than distances between geographical locations or mosquito (particularly 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) infestation rates, were likely responsible. The study by Nunes et al. marked one of the first uses of the comparative phylogenetic approach for vector-borne tropical diseases and implies the need for a similar approach in future studies aimed at investigating transmission patterns of a broad range of emerging vector-borne viruses. For example, this approach will allow researchers to determine if specific universal factors, such as vector species, are predictive of global transmission route or if health policy and prevention strategies tailored specifically to the pathogen, irrespective of the vector, are required for effective control.
