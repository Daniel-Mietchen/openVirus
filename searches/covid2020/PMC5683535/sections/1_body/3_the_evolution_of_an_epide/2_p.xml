 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], Faria’s group sought to further characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of ZIKV following introduction into this region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition to sequencing data, air traffic data for visitors to Brazil from other countries associated with major social events during 2012–2014 were included to test different hypotheses of airline-mediated introduction of ZIKV in Brazil. The results linked the origin of the Brazilian epidemic to a single introduction of ZIKV estimated to occur between May and December 2013, consistent with the Confederations Cup event, but predating the first reported cases in French Polynesia. Although these findings are of great value and importance to public health organizations, the authors drew an additional, and similarly valuable conclusion–large-scale patterns in human (and mosquito) mobility extending beyond air traffic data will provide more useful and testable hypotheses about disease emergence and spread than ad hoc hypotheses focused on specific events. This conclusion further supports the proposal for greater availability of epidemiological data among the scientific community.
