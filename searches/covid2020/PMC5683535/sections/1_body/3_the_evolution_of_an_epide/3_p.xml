<p id="Par28">Understanding both the rapid spread of the virus throughout South and Central America and the Caribbean as well as the initial emergence of the virus from the Ugandan Zika forest in the early 1900s is important for application to the control of future outbreaks, but increasing data may not be the only answer. Moreover, several different risk factors are likely responsible for these two migration events. Therefore, a more comprehensive approach that allows for the analysis of multiple potential factors and their distinct contribution to independent migration events without the loss of information (i.e., use of data that span the entire evolutionary history) is imperative for fully understanding a global epidemic from beginning to present.</p>
