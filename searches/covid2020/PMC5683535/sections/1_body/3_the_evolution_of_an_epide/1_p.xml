 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], phylogenetic analyses have helped to uncover the timing of transmission events and epidemiological origins. Moreover, when paired with comparative phylogeographic models, researchers have been able to identify risk factors most likely associated with these particular events. Since the inception of the Zika virus (ZIKV) pandemic around May of 2015 in Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], phylogeneticists and epidemiologists have sought to reveal mechanisms by which ZIKV has spread and the factors fueling the wide geographical leaps. A full-genome phylogeographic analysis of ZIKV isolates collected during 1968–2002 revealed very intricate spatiotemporal transmission patterns across Africa prior to the introduction into Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. From its origin in Uganda, two independent transmission events appeared to play a role in the spread of ZIKV from East Africa to the West circa 1920: the first involved the introduction of ZIKV to Côte d’Ivoire with subsequent spread to Senegal, and the second involved the spread of the virus from Nigeria to West Africa. Results from spatiotemporal analysis demonstrated that Uganda was the hub of the African epidemic as well as the common ancestor of the Malaysian lineages sampled during the 1966 outbreak [
