 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, many challenges for infectious disease research remain salient in contemporary molecular epidemiology, such as the incorporation of intra- and inter-host pathogen population characteristics as influential factors of transmission. Combating current and future emerging pathogens with potential for global spread requires innovative conceptual frameworks, new analytical tools, and advanced training in broad areas of research related to infectious diseases [
