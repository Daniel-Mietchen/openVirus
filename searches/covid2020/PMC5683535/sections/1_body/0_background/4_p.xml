<p id="Par15">Fortunately, recent developments in phylogenetic methods have made possible the ability to detect evolutionary patterns of a pathogen over a natural timescale (months-years) and allow for researchers to assess the pathogen’s ecological history imprinted within the underlying phylogeny. When reconstructed within the coalescent framework, and assuming a clock-like rate of evolution, the evolutionary history of a pathogen can provide valuable information as to the origin and timing of major population changes [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Even though phylogenetic methods are also limited in certain areas, such as restriction of analysis to only the infected population, a significant subset of these limitations can be overcome by complementary use of data from surveillance (both disease and syndromic) and monitoring [
