<p id="Par12">Globalization has dramatically changed the way in which pathogens spread among human populations and enter new ecosystems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Through migration, travel, trade, and various other channels, humans have and will continue to intentionally or unintentionally introduce new organisms into virgin ecosystems with potentially catastrophic consequences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Humans are not the only culprits, however; global climate pattern changes can alter local ecosystems, creating favorable conditions for the rapid spread of previously overlooked or even undiscovered organisms among humans, giving rise to unexpected epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recent years have been marked by global epidemics of Ebola, dengue, and Zika, derived from pathogens previously restricted to local outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization, more than one and a half billion people are currently awaiting treatment for neglected tropical diseases with similar potential for global spread, for which we have limited knowledge of etiology and treatment options [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This lack of knowledge further limits our ability to investigate the putative role of these pathogens in future epidemics or even pandemics.
