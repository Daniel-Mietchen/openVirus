<p id="Par13">Epidemiological strategies have been and still are the first line of defense against an outbreak or epidemic. Despite conventionality, traditional epidemiological methods for the analysis of global infectious diseases are subject to errors from various sources (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and are thus often inadequate to investigate the epidemiology of an infectious disease. Putative outbreak investigations typically ensue following case notification of one of the diseases recognized by local and global public health organizations. Trained investigators subsequently collect data on cases and diagnoses to establish a disease cluster. During active surveillance, more cases may be detected through outreach to healthcare facilities and nearby health departments. Relevant case contacts, such as family, friends, and partners, are also sought to provide details on demographics, clinical diagnoses, and other potential risk factors associated with the spread of the disease [

However, the lack of infrastructure, trained personnel, and resources in low- and middle-income countries are prohibitive against field epidemiology investigations, as contact tracing and surveillance both require systematic, unbiased, and detailed investigations. The reconstruction and interpretation of transmission networks are often very sensitive to response, selection, and recall biases and are strictly limited by surveillance data collected in many regions with diverse socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, even with a highly effective surveillance system, environmental, zoonotic, and vector-borne transmission dynamics confound analysis by shadowing alternative (i.e., not human-to-human) routes of disease acquisition. Furthermore, routine analyses of pathogen subtype and drug resistance are conducted only in a subset of developed nations, wherein variation in screening assays and protocols and therapy regimens increases the discordance in surveillance [
