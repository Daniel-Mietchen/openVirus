<p id="Par36">Although gaps remain in current evolutionary modeling capabilities when used with epidemiological surveillance data, it is only a matter of time before the challenges described herein and elsewhere are met with more realistic models that capture the complexity of infectious disease transmission. Furthermore, theoretical research in the field of infectious disease phylodynamics is still growing. Consequently, there is a need for a review of the more recently developed methods and techniques and their performance, as well as their application in areas within and outside the realm of infectious disease. For example, in the era of global health, translational genomics, and personalized medicine, the accumulating availability of genetic and clinical data provides the unique opportunity to apply this approach to studies of, e.g., tumor metastasis and chronic infections, which comprise complex transmission dynamics among tissues and/or cell types, not unlike the geographical spread of infectious diseases.</p>
