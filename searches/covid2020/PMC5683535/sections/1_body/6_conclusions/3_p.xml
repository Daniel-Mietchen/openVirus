<p id="Par34">Increasing mobility is nevertheless inconsequential without the cooperative sharing of genomic and epidemiological information. Although data are typically readily available to the public following peer-reviewed publication, the median review time of manuscripts submitted to, for example, 
 <italic>Nature</italic> is 150 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], this in addition to the time required for thorough analysis of the original data. This timeline seems quite long in retrospect of the 1918 “Spanish flu,” which spread to one-third of the global population in a relatively brief 12-month period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Data sharing prior to publication, even if only among a proportion of consenting institutions, may accelerate the process of dissemination of research findings to public health decision makers and practitioners, and its practice is not entirely unheard of. An excellent example of this type of collaboration is the “nextstrain” project (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nextstrain.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.nextstrain.org/</ext-link>). Nextstrain is a publicly available repository currently comprised of evolutionary datasets for Ebola, Zika, and avian and seasonal influenza viruses contributed by research groups from all over the world for the purpose of real-time tracking of viral epidemics. Similar projects have also recently developed in other research fields. Modeled after the Stand up to Cancer initiative, the Synodos collaborative funded by the Children’s Tumor Foundation in partnership with Sage Bionetworks brings together a consortium of multidisciplinary researchers, who have agreed to the sharing of data and relevant information, as well as results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. The ultimate goal of this cooperation is to accelerate the drug discovery process, which is highly applicable to global infectious disease research.
