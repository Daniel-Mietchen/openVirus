 <sup>st</sup> century has witnessed a major shift in breadth of scientific knowledge at the level of the individual researcher, requiring more focused training (e.g., molecular mechanisms) and greater collaborative efforts; meanwhile, a consensus of commonality and cross-disciplinary understanding is necessary for globalization of not only the economy, but also public health. This kind of understanding can be better achieved through interdisciplinary instruction on the theoretical and application skills related to both phylogenetics and epidemiology during early education. If successfully achieved, this combined training, in addition to access to modern NGS technology, such as handheld sequencers, would increase the mobility of labs and researchers, expanding the concept of lab-based research. Mobilized labs would, in turn, reduce our current reliance on few major public health organizations and the impact of limited resources on sampling and surveillance in developing countries.
