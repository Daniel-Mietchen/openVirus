         <p>Phylodynamics, the study of the interaction between epidemiological and pathogen evolutionary
            processes within and among populations, was originally defined in the context of rapidly
            evolving viruses and used to characterize transmission dynamics. The concept of phylodynamics
            has evolved since the early 21
            
            <sup>st</sup> century, extending its reach to slower-evolving pathogens, including bacteria and
            fungi, and to the identification of influential factors in disease spread and pathogen
            population dynamics.

         <p>The phylodynamic approach has now become a fundamental building block for the development
            of comparative phylogenetic tools capable of incorporating epidemiological surveillance
            data with molecular sequences into a single statistical framework. These innovative
            tools have greatly enhanced scientific investigations of the temporal and geographical
            origins, evolutionary history, and ecological risk factors associated with the growth
            and spread of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zika, and dengue
            and bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant 
            
            <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.

         <p>Capitalizing on an extensive review of the literature, we discuss the evolution of
            the field of infectious disease epidemiology and recent accomplishments, highlighting
            the advancements in phylodynamics, as well as the challenges and limitations currently
            facing researchers studying emerging pathogen epidemics across the globe.
