<p id="Par49">The increasing importance of therapeutic mAbs is apparent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), as mAbs have become the predominant treatment modality for various diseases over the past 25 years. During this time, major technological advances have made the discovery and development of mAb therapies quicker and more efficient. Since 2008, 48 new mAbs have been approved, contributing to a total global market of 61 mAbs in clinical use at the end of 2017, according to the US FDA. Strikingly, a total of 18 new antibodies were granted approval by the US FDA from 2018 to 2019 – this number was tallied from information contained on various websites, including the antibody society [
