<p id="Par48">Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are produced by B cells and specifically target antigens. The hybridoma technique introduced by Köhler and Milstein in 1975 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] has made it possible to obtain pure mAbs in large amounts, greatly enhancing the basic research and potential for their clinical use. Other scientific and technological advances have also enabled the successful translation of mAbs to the clinic. Around the world, at least 570 therapeutic mAbs have been studied in clinical trials by commercial companies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and are currently on the market [
