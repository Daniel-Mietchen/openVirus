<p id="Par53">Transgenic animals represent another technology for obtaining fully human mAbs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). This technology was introduced in 1994 by the publication of two transgenic mouse lines, the HuMabMouse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and the XenoMouse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The lines were genetically modified such that human immunoglobulin (Ig) genes were inserted into the genome, replacing the endogenous Ig genes and making these animals capable of synthesizing fully human antibodies upon immunization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The first human antibody generated in a transgenic mouse to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), panitumumab, was approved by the US FDA in 2006 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The number of fully human antibodies made from transgenic mice has increased rapidly, with the number of approved drugs currently at 19 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Depending on the immunization protocol, high-affinity human antibodies can be obtained through further selection of hybridoma clones generated from immunized transgenic mice. Using a theoretically similar approach, the generation of neutralizing human antibodies from human B cells has also yielded promising results for infectious disease therapeutics.
