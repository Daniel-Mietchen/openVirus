 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and comprises a murine mAb against T cell-expressed CD3 that functions as an immunosuppressant for the treatment of acute transplant rejection. The marketing end date of muromonab-CD3 is on July 30th, 2011 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To overcome problems of decreased immunogenic potential and efficacy, while making possible the therapeutic use of antibodies for an extended duration, researchers developed techniques to transform rodent antibodies into structures more similar to human antibodies, without loss of binding properties. The first chimeric antibody, anti-GPIIb/IIIa antigen-binding fragment (Fab) (abciximab), was approved in 1994 by the US FDA for inhibition of platelet aggregation in cardiovascular diseases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The drug was developed by combining sequences of the murine variable domain with human constant region domain (Fig.
