<p id="Par51">One exceptional advance that accelerated the approval of therapeutic mAbs was the generation of humanized antibodies by the complementary-determining region (CDR) grafting technique [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In CDR grafting, non-human antibody CDR sequences are transplanted into a human framework sequence in order to maintain target specificity [
