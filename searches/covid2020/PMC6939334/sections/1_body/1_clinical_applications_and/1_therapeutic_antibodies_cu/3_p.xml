<p id="Par58">mAbs are increasingly used for a broad range of targets; oncology, immunology, and hematology remain the most prevalent medical applications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Most mAbs have multiple disease indications and at least one that is cancer-related (lymphoma, myeloma, melanoma, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, colorectal, lung, breast, ovarian, head and neck cancers). As such, oncological diseases are the medical specialty most accessible to mAb treatments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Moreover, the number of target proteins known to function as either stimulatory or inhibitory checkpoints of the immune system has dramatically expanded, and numerous antibody therapeutics targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, cemiplimab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab), its ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, durvalumab, avelumab, atezolizumab) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyteâ€“associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4, ipilimumab) have been granted marketing approvals [
