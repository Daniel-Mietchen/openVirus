<p id="Par61">A total of 12 new mAbs were approved in the US during 2018. The majority of these products were approved for non-cancer indications, perhaps reflecting the higher approval success rate for antibodies as treatments for other diseases. Three antibodies (erenumab, galcanezumab, and fremaezumab) were approved for migraine prevention, and one (Ibalizumab) is used for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The three migraine-preventing drugs, Erenumab (Aimovig), galcanezumab (Emgality), and fremaezumab (Ajovy), are mAbs that block the activity of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor in migraine etiology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. CGRP acts through a heteromeric receptor, which is composed of a G protein-coupled receptor(calcitonin receptor-like receptor: CALCRL) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Both galcanezumab and fremaezumab bind to CGRP and block its binding to the receptor. However, erenumab is the only one of the three antibodies to target the extracellular domains of human G protein-coupled receptors CALCRL and RAMP1,interfering with the CGRP binding pocket [
