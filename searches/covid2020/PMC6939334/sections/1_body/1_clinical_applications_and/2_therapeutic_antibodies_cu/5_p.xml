<p id="Par67">Dostarlimab is an anti-PD-1 mAb that may be useful as a treatment for several types of cancers. GlaxoSmithKline announced results from a Phase I dose escalation and cohort expansion study (GARNET; NCT02715284) in 2018, which is expected to support a biologics license application submission to the US FDA in 2019. Dostarlimab is being assessed in patients with advanced solid tumors who have limited available treatment options in the GARNET study. The drug is administered at a dose of 500 mg every 3 weeks for the first 4 cycles, and 1000 mg every 6 weeks thereafter in four patient cohorts: microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) endometrial cancer, MSI-H non-endometrial cancer, microsatellite-stable endometrial cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Dostarlimab is also being evaluated in another Phase III study (NCT03602859), which is comparing platinum-based therapy with dostarlimab and niraparib versus standard of care platinum-based therapy as first-line treatment of Stage III or IV non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer [
