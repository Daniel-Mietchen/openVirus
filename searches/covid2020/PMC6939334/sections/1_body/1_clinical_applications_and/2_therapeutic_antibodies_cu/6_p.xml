<p id="Par68">Ublituximab is a glyco-engineered anti-CD20 antibody currently under clinical investigation in five late-stage clinical studies for different cancers (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL, non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma) and non-cancer (multiple sclerosis) indications. Three Phase III studies are exploring the efficacy of ublituximab in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Among these studies, the UNITY-CLL Phase III study (NCT02612311) is evaluating the combination of ublituximab and TGR-1202, a PI3K delta inhibitor, compared to anti-CD20 obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in untreated and previously treated CLL patients. Two other Phase III studies (ULTIMATE 1, NCT03277261 and ULTIMATE 2, NCT03277248) are evaluating the efficacy and safety of ublituximab compared to teriflunomide in 440 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis [
