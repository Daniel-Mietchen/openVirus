<p id="Par75">Humanized antibodies harbor human sequence in constant regions and nearly all human sequence in Fv, of which only CDRs are murine grafted. Antibodies of more human-like usually allow them to be higher tolerant and lower immunogenic in a clinical setting. For example, Perpetua et al. showed a case to support this concept [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. They compared a humanized anti-CD52 antibody with its parental murine version and demonstrated humanization offers a significant reduction in immunogenicity. However, humanized antibodies retain murine CDRs which could be regarded as foreign antigens by host immune systems and eventually arise immunogenicity. For example, ADA was detected in 0.5% of women with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated with Trastuzumab during their therapeutic courses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Recently, an immunogenicity analysis result from clinical data showed the ADA rates were 7.1% (21/296) in the HER-2 positive breast cancer patients with treatment of Trastuzumab [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. The variation of immunogenicity in the same antibody drug may be caused by many potential factors: the age, race, genetic background, other related diseases, and programs of drugs administration.
