<p id="Par74">The use of mAbs in a clinical setting should have several essential biophysical properties, including high antigen binding activity, high stability, and low immunogenicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Antibody immunogenicity means the degree of the host immune system can recognize and react to these therapeutic agents. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) induced by the immune system can be found while immunogenicity occurring in patients administered with antibody drugs. Anti-drug antibodies have the potential to neutralize therapeutic agents, which can reduce the efficacy of the drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Importantly, anti-drug antibodies may further cause adverse effects ranging from skin rashes to systemic inflammatory responses in the patients, which can impact both safety and efficacy of the antibody drugs in clinic use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Immunogenicity is influenced by several factors, such as drug dosage, administration strategy (route and combination), impurities contamination, aggregates arising from Ab/Ag binding complex, and structural features (sequence variation and glycosylation) [
