<p id="Par70">Due to the availability, low cost and quick production time for mouse mAbs, humanization of mouse mAbs has been implemented on a large scale. Non-humanized murine mAbs have many disadvantages as treatments. For example, patients treated with mouse mAbs will produce a rapid human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response. HAMAs will not only hasten the clearance of mouse mAbs but may also produce undesirable allergic reactions and tumor penetration. Moreover, the ability of patients to initiate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in response to murine fragment crystallizable region (Fc) is limited. On the other hand, humanized mAbs are able to effectively exert effector functions while decreasing the immunogenicity of murine antibodies.</p>
