<p id="Par73">The use of humanized antibodies has helped greatly to improve clinical tolerance of mAb therapeutics. Such intricate control over antibody sequences has opened the door to engineering mAbs for a wide range of possible applications in medicine. Currently, half of all mAbs used to treat humans are chimeric or humanized (Fig.
