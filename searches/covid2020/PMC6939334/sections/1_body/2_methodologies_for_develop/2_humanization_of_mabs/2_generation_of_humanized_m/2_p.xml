<p id="Par72">Multiple methods have been developed to quantify the humanness of the variable region of mAbs. Abhinandan and Martin designed a tool called “H-score” to assess the “degree of humanness” of antibody sequences, which calculates the mean sequence identity compared to a subset of human variable region sequences database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. A germinality index was defined subsequent to assist germline humanization of a macaque antibody [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. G-score was derived from the H-score to improve classification of germline framework sequence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. T20 score analyzer was established under a large database of ~ 38,700 human antibody variable region sequences to clearly separate human sequences from mouse sequences and many other species as well [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. It was used to reveal similarities between humanized antibodies and fully human antibodies. These humanness score tools are available online and allow assisting the generation of humanized antibody [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].
