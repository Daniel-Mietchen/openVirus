<p id="Par71">Humanized mAbs, of which only the CDRs of the light and heavy chains are murine, entered clinical development for the first time in 1988 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. CDR grafting is one of the most popular techniques in the production of humanized mAbs and was originally developed by Gregory P. Winter in 1986 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Using this technology, non-human CDR sequences are transplanted into human framework sequences, allowing the antibody to maintain the binding activity to the target antigen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The first US FDA approved CDR-grafted humanized mAb occurred in 1997 for daclizumab, which binds the IL-2 receptor and is used to prevent transplant rejection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Queen and collaborators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] developed daclizumab not only using CDR grafting, but also using the human framework that is maximally homologous to the murine framework, in order to decrease the loss of antigen recognition. In some cases, certain amino acids in the murine framework are crucial to maintain antibody binding activity. These residues may cooperate with CDRs to present an antibody paratope or directly interact with antigens. Currently, these crucial framework residues can be identified by observing the structure of antibody-antigen complex by X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and computer-aided protein homology modelling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The positions of amino acids in the framework may then be considered for restore by ‘human back to mouse’ mutations in CDR-grafted humanized antibodies, thereby improving the affinity and stability of the final product. Currently, web servers are being developed by integrated bioinformatics and antibody structure databases for rendering humanization experiments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. They provide the tools for human template selection, grafting, back-mutation evaluation, and antibody modeling. However, if the binding activity of antibodies is still compromised, it should be further performed affinity maturation to improve this situation.
