 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">235</xref>]. MHAA4549A, a human mAb targeting the hemagglutinin stalk of influenza A virus was cloned from a single human plasmablast cell from an influenza virus vaccinated donor [

A Phase II clinical trial of MHAA4549A as a monotherapy for acute uncomplicated seasonal influenza A in otherwise healthy adults was recently completed (NCT02623322). CT P27, which contains two human mAbs (CT P22 and CT P23), was created by Celltrion and is in Phase II (NCT03511066). RG 6024, also named MHAB5553A, was generated by Genentech with a modified version of the single B cell isolation method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">237</xref>]; it is currently under examination in Phase I (NCT02528903) trial. The Phase II trial for another antibody, TCN 032, was stopped in 2012 (NCT01719874).
