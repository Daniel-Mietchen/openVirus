HIV-1 envelope protein is an attractive therapeutic target for antibody and vaccine design. Five human mAbs against anti-HIV envelope protein have been generated by the single B cell approach and are under evaluation in clinical trials (3BNC117, Phase I/II; 10â€“1074, Phase I; VRC01, Phase I/II; PGT121, Phase I/II and N6, Phase I) [
