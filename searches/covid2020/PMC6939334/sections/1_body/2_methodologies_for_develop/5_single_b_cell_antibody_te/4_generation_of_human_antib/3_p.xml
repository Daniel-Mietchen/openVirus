<p id="Par111">The single B cell method has also successfully yielded anti-viral mAbs. Rapid isolation of dengue-neutralizing antibodies from human antigen-specific memory B-cell cultures [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">213</xref>] were both reported. In another example, Iizuka and colleagues described the identification of cytomegalovirus pp65 antigen-specific human mAbs using single B cell-based antibody gene cloning [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR225">225</xref>]. For rotavirus, the single B cell method was performed to analyze the rotavirus antibody gene repertoire of VP6-specific B cells in naive and memory B cell subsets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">226</xref>] and generate rotavirus-specific human mAbs by sorting single B cells from small-intestinal mucosa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227">227</xref>]. Human mAbs against zika virus NS1 have also been generated by the single B cell method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">228</xref>]. Besides mAbs for bacterial and virus infection, the single human B cell method has also yielded a complement factor H (CFH) therapeutic antibody for cancer. The recombinant anti-CFH antibody can induce complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) through complement activation and release of anaphylatoxins [
