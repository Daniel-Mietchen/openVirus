<p id="Par108">After single B cell sorting, direct cloning of each Ig heavy chain and corresponding light chain should be performed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>]. This step involves the use of nested or semi-nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for amplification of the variable heavy and light chain of each identified B cell. Usually, forward primers are directed toward IgH and IgL variable leader sequences and reverse primers are complementary to the Ig constant region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">214</xref>]. By optimizing different primer-set mixtures, the recoveries of the V
 <sub>H</sub> and V
 <sub>L</sub> may be improved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">215</xref>]. The genes are then cloned and expressed in mammalian cell lines for the immediate generation of recombinant mAbs. Following the detection of mAb reactivity, the characteristics of each generated mAb are determined. Furthermore, for high-throughput screening and evaluation of secreted mAbs with ideal reactivity, a cell-based microarray chip system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR216">216</xref>] and microengraving techniques [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">217</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>] have been described. The cell-based microarray chip system, immunospot array assay on a chip, enables the trapping of secreted antibodies by a chip that is coated with antibody against Ig, therefore, it is used to identify and recover specific antibody-secreting cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR216">216</xref>]. The microengraving method depends on the use of a soft lithographic technique to generate microarrays comprising the secreted antibodies of single cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">217</xref>]. These two approaches offer the advantages of early and rapid identification of clones with high affinity and specificity to the antigen of interest.
