<p id="Par120">Diversification of antibody genes is the initial step of affinity maturation in vitro, and this step may be achieved using various strategies, such as random mutations, targeted mutations or chain shuffling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">246</xref>]. Mutations can be randomly introduced into the variable regions of antibody genes by error-prone PCR in mutator 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">247</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">248</xref>]. Chain shuffling approaches are those in which one of two chains, V
 <sub>H</sub> and V
 <sub>L</sub>, is fixed and recombined with a repertoire of partner chains to produce a next-generation library [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR249">249</xref>]. Moreover, mutations can be introduced to particular regions of the antibody gene. This type of targeting mutation approach was employed to diversify CDR residues and was shown to be effective in ameliorating the affinity of antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR250">250</xref>]. Therefore, this method is more relevant to in vivo somatic mutations during B cell evolution because mutations accumulate more efficiently in the CDR than framework residues.
