<p id="Par119">Phage display and yeast display have been widely used for affinity maturation of antibodies, due to their amenability to easily screen for high affinity variants and to high throughput applications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Methods for increasing antibody affinity can be broadly divided into two broad categories. The first is to generate a large randomly mutated library of CDR or entire variable domain sequences, followed by a selection of higher affinity variants from this large number of mutants. Another approach is to prepare small libraries by focused mutagenesis or hotspot mutagenesis that mimics in vivo affinity maturation. In this focused method, a high affinity variant is selected to be randomized at individual positions in each of the six CDRs or at a discrete point in the variable domain called the hotspot. The usual practice is to combine different mutations, resulting in small increases in affinity. The combination of these different mutations may have an additive or synergistic effect that can result in substantial increases in the affinity of the antibody to the antigen [

Phage display technology can be employed to identify high affinity antibodies in an antibody gene mutation library under stringent biopanning conditions, including decreased antigen amount, extended incubation and intensive washing steps or by competition with soluble antigen [
