<p id="Par118">Affinity maturation is an important characteristic of the humoral immune response, which can result in antibodies with low picomolar affinity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">240</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>]. High affinity is a crucial attribute of antibodies for the neutralization of cytokines or growth factor-induced signaling. Generally, for a mAb to be considered for therapeutic drug development, it should have an affinity of 1â€‰nM or less for the target antigen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">242</xref>]. Moreover, humanization of mouse mAbs frequently reduces affinity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR243">243</xref>]. Thus, the use of affinity maturation is often a necessary step in antibody drug development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">244</xref>].
