<p id="Par78">The process of identifying mAbs from a phage-displayed library begins with antibody-library construction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The variable heavy (V
 <sub>H</sub>) and variable light (V
 <sub>L</sub>) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, representing the Ig gene-encoding repertoire, are ligated into a phage display vector (phagemid). High quality mRNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The different V
 <sub>H</sub> and V
 <sub>L</sub> chain-region gene families are then amplified using specific primers to amplify all transcribed variable regions within the Ig repertoire [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. The format of antibodies in a phage-displayed library can be either scFv or Fab fragments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>); scFvs are composed of the V
 <sub>H</sub> and V
 <sub>L</sub> domain connected by a short flexible linker. Antibody Fab fragments displayed on the phage coat protein have comparably higher structural stability and can be readily converted to intact IgG antibodies, usually without impairing binding activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. The elegance of phage-displayed libraries is apparent in the linkage between antibody phenotype (specificity and sensitivity) and genotype (genetic information) via the phage particle. Due to the small size and high solubility (10
 <sup>13</sup> particles/ml) of phage particles, repertoire sizes up to 10
 <sup>11</sup> independent clones can be efficiently produced and displayed in a single library [
