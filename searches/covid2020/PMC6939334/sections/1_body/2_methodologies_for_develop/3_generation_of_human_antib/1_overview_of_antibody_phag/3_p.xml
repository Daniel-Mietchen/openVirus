<p id="Par79">Gene repertoires for phage display libraries can be obtained from naïve or immunized animals, or the libraries may be synthetically constructed using randomized CDR sequences within fixed frameworks. Phage display naïve antibody libraries are constructed from rearranged V genes of IgM repertoires. Because the gene sequences are derived from B cells of human donors, the naïve libraries are relatively close to the human antibody germ line and have a low risk of immunogenicity. The main advantage of an immunized library over a naïve library is that antibody genes in the immunized library have undergone natural affinity maturation in vivo, allowing the development of high-affinity antibodies against the target. However, this approach requires that immunogenic response can be successfully induced by the antigen of interest, and new libraries must be prepared for each new target. Single large naïve [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>] libraries have yielded high affinity antibodies (sub-nanomolar range) against a wide spectrum of targets. Therefore, such non-immunized libraries have the distinct advantages of avoiding issues with immunological tolerance in immunized mice, and they do not require new immunized libraries for each new target.
