<p id="Par77">Phage display is the first and still the most widely used technology for in vitro antibody selection. The strategy was developed based on the excellent work of George P. Smith in 1985 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], who used recombinant DNA techniques to fuse foreign peptides with a coat protein (pIII) of bacteriophage M13 in order to display peptides on the bacteriophage surface. He then created “antibody-selectable phage vectors” and described an in vitro method that enabled affinity selection of antigen-specific phage-displayed antibodies from 10
 <sup>8</sup>-fold excess phage pools [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. It was later discovered that scFv, small antibody formats, can be expressed on phage filaments. At the time, there were three different research institutions independently establishing phage-displayed scFv or Fab antibody libraries: the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>], the German Cancer Research Center in Germany [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], and Scripps Research Institute in the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Since then, these phage-displayed antibody libraries have proven to be a reliable discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human mAbs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>].
