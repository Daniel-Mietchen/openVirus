<p id="Par91">PD-L1, a cell-surface protein, binds to its receptor PD-1 on immune cells, downregulating T cell inflammatory activity to promote self-tolerance by the immune system. Many types of tumors have been found to express PD-L1 on the surface of cancer cells, using the immune-suppressing action to evade immune attacks. Avelumab (Bavencio) is fully human IgG
 <sub>1</sub> lamda antibody against PD-L1, which was derived from a phage-displayed na√Øve Fab library (Dyax) [
