<p id="Par90">Tyrosine kinase receptors, including EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), play crucial roles in tumorigenesis, with higher expression and activation in tumors than in normal tissues. These characteristics make the receptors potentially valuable targets for drug development. Necitumumab (Portrazza) is an anti-EGFR human antibody that was identified by screening high EGFR-expressing epidermal carcinoma cells (A431) with a non-immunized phage Fab library of 3.7 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> clones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. Necitumumab was approved in 2015 and is now a first-line therapy in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of squamous NSCLC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>]. VEGFR2 is not only highly expressed in tumor endothelial cells, where it regulates tumor angiogenesis, but it also expressed on the surface of cancer cells. The anti-VEGFR2 human antibody, ramucirumab (Cyramza), was approved for the treatment of gastric cancer, metastatic NSCLC and metastatic colorectal cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>]. The development of ramucirumab was initiated by using a phage-displayed human naïve Fab library (Dyax) containing 3.7 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> independent clones for biopanning against the extracellular domain of human VEGFR2 protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. Three Fab clones, D2C6, D2H2, and D1H4, were selected based on their specific binding to VEGFR2 with nanomolar affinity and their ability to neutralize VEGF-A-activated VEGFR2 signaling. Interestingly, these three Fab clones do not cross-react with murine VEGFR2 and share an identical V
 <sub>H</sub> sequence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. After affinity maturation with stringent biopanning rounds, Fab clone 1121 (IMC-1121B) was selected and showed more than the 30-fold improvement of VEGFR2-binding activity. This clone was subsequently engineered into the human intact IgG
 <sub>1</sub> version (ramucirumab), which has an affinity of 50 pM [
