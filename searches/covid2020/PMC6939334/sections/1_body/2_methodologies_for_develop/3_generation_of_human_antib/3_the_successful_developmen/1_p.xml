<p id="Par88">Fully human therapeutic antibodies in current clinical use were discovered from either phage display or transgenic mice approaches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Phage display has the advantage of allowing researchers to tailor critical characteristics of successful antibody drugs (e.g., affinity, specificity, cross-reactivity and stability). There are nine phage display-derived human antibodies currently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of human disease (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), demonstrating the reliability of this technique as a platform for antibody discovery.
