<p id="Par95">Many researchers have begun to take advantage of these free technologies. For example, Wayne Maraso and colleagues at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Harvard University have constructed two phage display libraries containing 12 billion (Mehta I) and 15 billion (Mehta II) human naïve scFv antibody phages. These libraries have been used to identify numerous human scFv antibodies against a variety of targets [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>]. We have also established a phage-displayed human naive scFv library at the Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology (ICOB) in Academia Sinica in Taiwan. The antibody gene repertoires of the ICOB phage antibody library were isolated from the PBMCs of 50 healthy human donors, producing a library size of 60 billion individual scFv clones. This collection has been successfully used to select antibodies that bind a wide spectrum of target antigens, including pure recombinant proteins, glycans, cancer cells and virus particles [
