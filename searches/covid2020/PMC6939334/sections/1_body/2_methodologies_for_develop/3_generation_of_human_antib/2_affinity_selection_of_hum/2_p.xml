<p id="Par82">The biopanning method is not only restricted to known recombinant proteins. In fact, the phage display technique may also be utilized to select antibodies against whole cells, unveiling previously unknown antigens on the tumor cell surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. Cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease, and only a few tumor cells with stem-like properties are able to initiate and sustain tumor development; these cells are often referred as tumor initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Phage display technology is well suited for applications in CSC research, and several antibodies have already been identified from phage display libraries for their ability to bind known CSC markers, such as CD133 and CD44 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Moreover, novel CSC surface markers may be identified by selecting phage-displayed antibodies that bind to a CSC-like population and then identifying the corresponding target antigens [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. The use of tumor biopsy tissue as a biological material allows researchers to probe the tumor microenvironment, which may be highly relevant for clinical use. Phage display technology has been used to probe cancer tissue biopsies in order to generate antibody fragments that specifically recognize tumor subpopulations, such as CSCs and tumor-associated endothelial cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>] as well as other clinically relevant tumor antigens [
