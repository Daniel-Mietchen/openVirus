<p id="Par83">Antibodies or antibody fragments have been referred to as targeted drug delivery “missiles” for their ability to direct homing of drugs to tumors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. For example, immunoliposomes have been demonstrated to provide conventional liposomal drugs with cancer targeting ability, which can increase the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. Cellular internalization of the targeting ligand is an essential outcome for successful tumor-targeted liposomal drug delivery [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. For this reason, an efficient phage display-based selection approach was designed to map tumor internalizing epitopes, wherein a phage-displayed library was incubated with living cancer cells at 37 °C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. This method was successfully applied to rapidly identify several scFvs with high rates of internalization in several types of tumors; the target antigens were subsequently identified, and intracellular drug delivery systems were further developed [
