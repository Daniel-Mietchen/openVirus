<p id="Par84">The identification of mAbs with phage display is an entirely in vitro process. Thus, it is not restricted by immunological tolerance, allowing for the identification of antibodies against poorly immunogenic antigens or those that are difficult to obtain using animal immunization methods (e.g., glycans or toxic agents). The in vitro nature of the assay can be especially useful when identifying specific antibodies against novel or gene-mutated pathogens in an outbreak of emergent infectious diseases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. The antigens on pathogens usually induce a strong immune response in patients, making it common for infected individuals to naturally produce high-affinity antibodies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. Such a library can allow for the rapid identification of high-affinity antibodies that may then be used as guides for vaccine design, or to develop therapeutic drugs and diagnostic reagents.
