<p id="Par81">Antibody libraries are typically screened by iterative selection cycles to enrich target-binding phages, followed by amplification of the bound phages in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. The affinity screening process for antibody libraries is called biopanning (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Repeated rounds of selection allow for the enrichment of very rare antigen-binding phage clones, eventually resulting in the selection of the most highly specific binders. This stringent process is a critical feature of phage display that allows mAbs to be isolated in a period as short as a couple of weeks, far more quickly than the traditional hybridoma method [

Polystyrene surfaces with high protein binding capacity, such as 96-well immuno-plates and immuno-tubes, are widely used for antigen immobilization. Additionally, magnetic beads with protein G/A, streptavidin, maleimide or N-hydroxysuccinimide can be used to immobilize antigens and perform biopanning in solution.
