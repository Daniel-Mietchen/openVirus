<p id="Par96">Transgenic animals provide a reliable platform for antibody drug development. Compared with other technologies for human antibody production, transgenic animals have several advantages, i.e., no need for humanization, more diversity, in vivo affinity maturation and clonal selection for antibody optimization. However, the large size of human Ig loci was a challenge during the development of transgenic mouse antibody technology. Additionally, the production of repertoires in transgenic mice that are similar or comparable those in humans requires diverse rearrangements combined with high expression of human V, D, and J segments [
