<p id="Par100">In order to overcome the drawbacks of a fully human heavy chain antibody, it is necessary to retain the original murine constant region. If a chimeric antibody with human Fab and murine Fc can be generated in mouse, the murine Fc would modulate the signaling for somatic hypermutation during antibody affinity maturation [

 <sub>H</sub>, D, and J
 <sub>H</sub> genes to the rat constant region locus in 2013. The large segments of human IgH and IgL were subcloned and linked by bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and YAC techniques, followed by micro-injection of the minilocus plasmid into fertilized rat oocytes. Meanwhile, endogenous rat Ig loci were silenced with a zinc finger nuclease. The resulting rat strain (OmniRat) chimeric human exhibits antibody production, antigen affinity and somatic mutations similar to wild-type rats. In 2014, Lee et al. [

 <sub>H</sub>-D-J
 <sub>H</sub> and Vκ-Jκ inserted directly upstream of murine Cμ and Cκ regions (KyMouse). After antigen immunization, the KyMouse can process somatic hypermutation and produce high-affinity chimeric human antibodies. In another effort, Murphy et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>] used BACs to assemble large human Ig genes and serially micro-injected the constructs into mouse ES cells. The human IgH and IgL genes targeted and replaced the murine IgH and IgL, upstream of the constant region (VelocImmune mouse).
