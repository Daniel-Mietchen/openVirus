Two antibody drugs from the XenoMouse are used for autoimmune dermatologic diseases. One, secukinumab (Cosentyx, Novartis, human IgG1), binds to proinflammatory cytokine IL-17Î± to reduce inflammation in psoriasis [

The two mAb drugs were approved by the US FDA for psoriasis treatment in 2015 and 2017, respectively.
