<p id="Par103">From the HuMabMouse, there have also been eight antibody drugs approved by the US FDA (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Two drugs, ipilimumab (Yervoy, Bristol-Myers Squibb, human IgG1) and nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb, human IgG4/kappa), are used for melanoma treatment; the drugs were approved in 2011 and 2014, respectively. Ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, blocking its interaction with B7 on APCs and causing cytotoxic T lymphocytes to kill cancer cells [

Among the mAb drugs derived from the HuMabMouse, some are used for autoimmune diseases. For example, ustekinumab (Stelara, Johnson &amp; Johnson, human IgG1/kappa) binds to cytokines, especially the p40 subunits of IL-12 and IL-23, blocking proinflammatory signaling to ease inflammation. This drug was approved for severe plaque psoriasis [
