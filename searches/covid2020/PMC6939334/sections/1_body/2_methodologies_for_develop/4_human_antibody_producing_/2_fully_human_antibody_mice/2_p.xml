<p id="Par98">At a similar time, various murine Ig knockout mouse strains were generated. In 1993, Chen et al. knocked out murine J
 <sub>H</sub> and Jκ genes with gene targeted deletion, inactivating mouse Ig [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]. The human IgH and IgL transgenic mice were then crossed with murine IgH and IgL knockout mice in an attempt to create lines that could generate more diverse human antibodies. In 1994, the first human Ig -transgenic mice strain, HuMabMouse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], was generated by Longberg et al. In this line, human IgH and IgΚ are expressed in murine IgH and IgΚ deficient mice. The entire human IgH genome is about 1.29 Mb and IgΚ is about 1.39 Mb, but the human Ig genome introduced into mice was less than 80 kb [
