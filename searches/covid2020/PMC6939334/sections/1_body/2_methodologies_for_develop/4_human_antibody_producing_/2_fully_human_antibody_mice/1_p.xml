<p id="Par97">The idea of producing human antibodies in transgenic mice was first suggested in 1985 when Alt et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>] proposed introducing human antibody genes into the mouse germline. This idea was unprecedented and provided a new direction for the development of human antibody production. In 1989, Brüggemann et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>] cloned the first human heavy chain construct, containing two human V
 <sub>H</sub> genes, for diversity segments (D) linked to the human heavy chain joining cluster (J
 <sub>H</sub>), and the μ constant region. The 25 kb construct was micro-injected as a mililocus plasmid into fertilized murine eggs, allowing its random insertion into the murine genome. About 4% of B lymphocytes expressed human μ chain at detectable levels in these transgenic mice. In addition, hybridomas of human IgM antibody could also be established using this transgenic strain. In 1992, Taylor et al. cloned the human κ light chain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>] construct, containing one human kappa light chain variable (Vκ) gene, the human kappa light chain joining cluster (Jκ) and kappa constant region (Cκ). While the mice expressed the human heavy chain (V
 <sub>H</sub>-D-J
 <sub>H</sub>-Cμ-Cγ
 <sub>1</sub>) and the human kappa light chain, the amount of human antibody was less than 10% of total antibodies, so the expression of human antibodies was not compatible with expression of mouse endogenous Ig [
