 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>] and Choi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>] used yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors in 1993 to respectively construct human IgΚ (~ 300 kb) and IgH (~ 85 kb) genes via yeast homologous recombination. In 1994, Green et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] constructed human IgΚ (~ 170 kb) and IgH (~ 220 kb) genome YACs and successfully introduced them into mouse embryonic stem cells by yeast spheroplast-ES cell fusion. Furthermore, in 1997, Mendez et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] introduced a larger human IgΚ (~ 700 Kb) or IgH (~ 1 Mb) YAC into mouse ES cells, crossing the human Ig mice with murine IgH and IgL knockout mice to generate XenoMouse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>]. As expected, the XenoMouse only express human antibodies rather than mouse antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>]. While the development of this line has eliminated the interference from mouse endogenous Ig and expanded the human Ig genes, the efficiency of human antibody generation, Ig class-switching and somatic hypermutation still remain low, due to a lack of mouse constant region gene expression [
