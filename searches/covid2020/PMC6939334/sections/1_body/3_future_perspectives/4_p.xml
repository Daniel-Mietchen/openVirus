<p id="Par124">Although new methods have been well-established for generating fully human antibodies, such as human antibody transgenic mice and human single B cell antibody techniques, phage display still has advantages as an antibody drug discovery platform, based on its efficient and economical in vitro selection methodology. Recently, some advanced techniques have been applied in antibody discovery, including high-throughput robotic screening [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR272">272</xref>], next generation sequencing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR273">273</xref>] and single cell sequencing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274">274</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275">275</xref>]. These techniques are expected to greatly accelerate the identification of specific phage binders, facilitating mAb development for use in research, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceuticals for the treatment of human disease.
