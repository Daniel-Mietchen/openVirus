<p id="Par128">Over the past decade, generation of mAbs from isolated single B cells has become an increasingly attractive approach. To date, no US FDA-approved therapeutic mAbs have been derived from this method; however, it possesses several major advantages, and ongoing challenges are currently being solved. The success of the method relies heavily on the antigen labeling technique, the configuration of sorting antigens (e.g., monomer or dimer) and the set of primers used for amplification. In the future, the recovery of mAbs from single B cells is expected to become a powerful tool in combination with next generation sequencing for diagnostics, pharmacokinetic application, and clinical therapeutics.</p>
