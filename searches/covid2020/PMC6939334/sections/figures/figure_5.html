 <caption> Schematic overview showing the development of antibody-based therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Therapeutic antibodies can be roughly separated into two broad categories. The first category involves the direct use of the naked antibody for disease therapy. Antibodies in this category are used for cancer treatment and elicit cell death by different mechanisms, including ADCC/CDC, direct targeting of cancer cells to induce apoptosis, targeting the tumor microenvironment, or targeting immune checkpoints. For antibodies in the second category, additional engineering is performed to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. Some general approaches for the use of these antibodies include immunocytokine, antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), antibody-radionuclide conjugate (ARC), bispecific antibody, immunoliposome, and CAR-T </caption>
