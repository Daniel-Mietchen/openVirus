 <caption> Schematic overview of antibody humanization from murine antibodies (green domains) to fully human antibodies (orange domains) and associated suffixes. a The murine monoclonal antibody. b The chimeric monoclonal antibody: variable regions are of murine origin, and the rest of the chains are of human origin. c Humanized monoclonal antibody: only includes the hypervariable segments of murine origin. d Human monoclonal. C H: domains of the constant region of the heavy chain; C L: constant domain of the light chain; Fab and Fc: fragments resulting from proteolysis; V H: variable domain of the heavy chain; V L: variable domain of the light chain </caption>
