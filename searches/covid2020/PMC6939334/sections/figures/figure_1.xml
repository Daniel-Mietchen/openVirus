  <p>Timeline from 1975 showing the successful development of therapeutic antibodies and their applications. Many biotech companies that promised antibodies as anticancer “magic bullets” were launched from 1981 to 1986. The height of the line and numerical annotations represent the estimated market value of mAb therapeutics in each indicated year (shown as billions of US dollars). Antibodies colored in red represent the top 10 best-selling antibody drugs in 2018. Ab, antibody; ALCL, systematic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma; aTTP, acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; BC, breast cancer; CD, cluster of differentiation; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; CGRPR, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor; CRC, colorectal cancer; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; GC, gastric cancer; GD2, disialoganglioside G
   <sub>D2</sub>; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; IgE, immunoglobulin E; IL, interleukin; IL-17R, interleukin-17 receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MCC, merkel-cell carcinoma; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1; PD-L1, programmed death-ligand 1; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand; VEGF-A, vascular endothelial growth factor A; VEGFR2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2; vWF, von Willebrand factor; XLH, X-linked hypophosphatemia
