  <p>Construction and affinity selection with phage-display antibody library. 
   <bold>a</bold> Outline of the procedure for constructing a phage-displayed antibody (Fab or scFv) library. 
   <bold>b</bold> Structure of IgG molecule. Fab consists of the light chain and the first two domains of the heavy chain. scFv is composed of the variable heavy (V
   <sub>H</sub>) and variable light (V
   <sub>L</sub>) domains joined by a short flexible polypeptide linker. 
   <bold>c</bold> Biopanning with a phage-displayed library. Initial pools of antibodies on the surface of phages are applied to antigens immobilized on a solid surface, e.g., ELISA plates or magnetic beads. Non-specific phages are removed by stringent washing. Antigen-bound phages are eluted and re-infected into 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> to produce a subset of phages for the next cycle of panning. After several rounds, the antigen-binding clones are sufficiently enriched and individual clones can be selected for further analysis
