<p>She received lung protective ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (i.e. low tidal volumes and high positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP)) for continued hypoxia. Unfortunately, two weeks later, she again developed another spontaneous pneumothorax on the left lung and required chest tube drainage. Over four weeks in the intensive care unit, we manage to wean down the ventilatory support. She had an excellent clinical response and discharged with tapering prednisolone over two weeks. At six weeks of outpatient follow up, she was symptom‐free, and her chest X‐ray revealed residual bilateral reticulations.</p>
