<p>Our case demonstrates the features of SES after the gluteal silicone filler. No specific site for vascular infiltration was identified in our case; however, many injection marks were observed on the buttocks. MRI breast confirmed that there is no leak from the silicone breast implants and no residual collection in the gluteal region. Thus, the decision not to remove the breast implant and not for surgical exploration of the possibilities of remaining gluteal silicone collection was made after a multidisciplinary meeting comprises of pulmonologist, plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and anaesthetic team. A trans‚Äêbronchial lung biopsy was deemed to be a less invasive approach to obtain lung biopsies in order to avoid the risk of general anaesthesia due to poor pulmonary reserve.</p>
