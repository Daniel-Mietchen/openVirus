<p>Pulmonary SES results from silicone embolizing to the lungs from an inadvertent intravenous injection or local tissue destruction. The neutrophils ingested the embolization of the silicone material into the lung via the haematogenous or lymphatic and alveolar macrophages induces pneumonitis by local cell‚Äêmediated inflammation and release of free radicals and proteolytic enzymes 
 <xref rid="rcr2538-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. The release of silicone emboli also leads to occlusion of the microvasculature and trigger the inflammatory response, resulting in pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.
