<p>The detection of HCoV‐NL63 in our patient is incidental. This is consistent with the literature that HCoV‐NL63 can be frequently found in asymptomatic individuals 
 <xref rid="rcr2538-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>. Although, HCoV‐NL63 can infects both the upper and lower respiratory tract, it generally associated with mild symptoms, such as fever, cough, pharyngitis, and rhinitis 
 <xref rid="rcr2538-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. In rare cases, pneumonia can occur. In total contrast to silicon pneumonitis, lung biopsy histopathological features of HCoV‐NL63 pneumonia are chronic pulmonary inflammation, severe alveolar damage, intra‐alveolar hyaline membranes, and interstitial oedema
