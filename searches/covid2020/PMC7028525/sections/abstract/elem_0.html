      <p>Liquid silicone (polydimethylsiloxane) is an inert material that is commonly used
         for cosmetic purpose. Silicone embolization syndrome (SES) can rapidly progress to
         pneumonitis as a consequence of the injection of nonmedical‚Äêgrade liquid silicone.
         We describe a case of severe silicone pneumonitis complicated with acute respiratory
         distress syndrome and bilateral pneumothorax secondary to silicone gluteal augmentation.
         In this case report, we aim to discuss our experience and approach in managing an
         uncommon case of SES.
