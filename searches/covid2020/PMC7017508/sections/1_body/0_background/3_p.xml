 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. More than 80% of patients with macrolide-sensitive MP (MSMP) have shown defervescence within 48–72 h after the initiation of macrolide treatment; this occurs in approximately 30% of patients with macrolide-resistant MP pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite its high prevalence, large-scale epidemiologic studies of macrolide-resistant MP pneumonia are scarce.
