<p id="Par20">The etiologies of CAP affect the disease burden, development of long-term sequelae, and mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The mortality, severity, and disease burden due to CAP differ by age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, prediction of the causative pathogens and clinical courses before the identification of respiratory pathogens in children with CAP is needed to improve disease outcomes. There are annual and seasonal variabilities in the respiratory pathogens that cause CAP. In addition, the characteristics of these pathogens, including susceptibility to antibiotics, change over time. Assessments of the annual and seasonal variabilities and pathogen characteristics could provide important information needed to establish a direction for vaccine development and health care policies. However, comprehensive studies on these topics are scarce.
