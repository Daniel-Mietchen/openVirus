<p id="Par34">We evaluated the annual and seasonal patterns in respiratory etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization between 2010 to 2015 in a nationwide retrospective cohort study. The most common causes of hospitalization due to pediatric CAP were MP and RSV, with peaks in October–November and November–December, respectively. There were two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015) during the study period. In children hospitalized with CAP due to MP pneumonia, the monthly rates of clinical MRMP and MLEP pneumonias showed increasing trends, together comprising up to 36% of the total cases of MP pneumonia during the study period. In children less than 2 years of age, RSV was the most common cause of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization, whereas the most common cause was MP in children older than 2 years as well as in adolescents. The rate of children admitted to the intensive care unit was highest in children with RSV pneumonia, followed by those with AdV pneumonia. Ventilator care was most commonly needed in children with AdV pneumonia, followed by those with RSV pneumonia. The results of the present study provide fundamental data on the periodicity of epidemics of pathogens that cause pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization.</p>
