<p id="Par30">The two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015) corresponded with the two peaks of CAP. The incidence of MP pneumonia requiring hospitalization in children peaked from October to November in each year (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The most common clinical phenotype of MP pneumonia was MSMP, followed by MLEP and MRMP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). During the study period, the monthly rate of MSMP/total MP pneumonia was 63.6–100.0% (mean ± SD, 81.3 ± 7.7), that of MRMP/total MP pneumonia was 0.0–11.0% (4.2 ± 4.3), and that of MLEP/total MP pneumonia was 0.0–30.3% (14.5 ± 14.2) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends (seasonal Mann-Kendall trend tests, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0644 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0066, respectively), whereas the rates of clinical MSMP pneumonia showed a significant reduction during the study period (seasonal Mann-Kendall trend test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0028).
