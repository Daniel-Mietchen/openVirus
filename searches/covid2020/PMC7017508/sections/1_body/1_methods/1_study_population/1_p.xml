<p id="Par23">We conducted a retrospective chart review of children hospitalized with CAP between January 2010 and December 2015 in a cohort of children younger than 18 years of age from 23 medical centers in South Korea. During the study period, a total of 65,243 children were diagnosed with CAP based on clinical features, chest radiography, and laboratory findings. Among them, 30,994 children underwent real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses for respiratory virus (

To identify differences in causative pathogens according to age, the enrolled children were divided into four age groups as follows: &lt; 2 years, 2 years to &lt; 5 years, 5 years to &lt; 12 years, and 12 years to &lt; 18 years. Information regarding the clinical characteristics, radiologic findings, and laboratory findings was collected from the patient’s electronic medical record. The Institutional Review Boards of all participating medical centers reviewed and approved the study protocol.
