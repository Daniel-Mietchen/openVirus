         <p id="Par1">Community–acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the leading worldwide causes of childhood
            morbidity and mortality. Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time
            dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies
            of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization.

         <p id="Par2">We conducted a retrospective study in 30,994 children (aged 0–18 years) with CAP between
            2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea. 
            
            <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP, macrolide-less
            effective MP (MLEP), and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after
            initiation of macrolide treatment, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide
            sensitivity tests.

         <p id="Par3">MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens
            of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015), the rates of clinical
            MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia.
            In children &lt; 2 years of age, RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP, followed
            by MP (9.4%); however, MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2–18 years
            of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia.
            The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia,
            and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia.

         <p id="Par4">The present study provides fundamental data to establish public health policies to
            decrease the disease burden due to CAP and improve pediatric health.
