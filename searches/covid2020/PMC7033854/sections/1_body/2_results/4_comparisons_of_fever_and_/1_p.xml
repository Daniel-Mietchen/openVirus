 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the changes in mean body temperature at admission and during the 7 days after admission between Adv and Non-Adv group patients. In addition, we also compared the fever and response to antipyretic treatment between the patients in the no pathogen group and in the Adv and Non-Adv groups, the results of which are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. In general, Adv group patients had a much longer duration of fever after admission than the Non-Adv patients (3.2 ± 1.6 days 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 1.9 ± 1.2 days, 2.2 ± 1.5 days, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.018) and symptom onset (5.8 ± 2.2 days
 <italic> vs. </italic>3.9 ± 2.5 days, 3.7 ± 2.0 days, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006). To evaluate the degree of fever, we assessed the mean temperature and number of patients to the maximal temperature at admission. The Adv group patients had higher a mean temperature at admission (37.8 ± 0.3 °C
 <italic> vs.</italic> 37.3 ± 0.3 °C
 <italic> vs. </italic>37.3 ± 0.2 °C, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005), and more observed instances of a temperature of over 40 and 39 to 40 °C (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;  0.001). The Adv group patients took longer to attain the maximal fall in body temperature than the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen group patients at admission (10.2 ± 5.6 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 8.0 ± 4.5 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 8.6 ± 5.5, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.015).
