<p id="Par24">We compared the laboratory and radiologic findings between the Adv and Non-Adv groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The percentage of patients having leukopenia and thrombocytopenia was higher in the Adv patients 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;  0.001), while leukocytosis was more common in the Non-Adv group patients (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.035). The levels of infection markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin showed no difference between the two groups. In addition, total bilirubin and creatinine levels showed no significant difference between the two groups.
