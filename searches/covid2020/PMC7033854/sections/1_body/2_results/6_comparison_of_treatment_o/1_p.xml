<p id="Par32">All patients received empirical antibiotic treatment (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>) as follows: a 3rd generation cephalosporin plus azithromycin was the most common regimen (
 <italic>n</italic> = 243, 96.8%), followed by piperacillin/tazobactam plus respiratory quinolone (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5, 2.0%). The change in antibiotics treatment regimen was more frequent in the Adv group patients than in the Non-Adv patients (70.1% 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 27.2%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.024). The duration of antibiotic treatment was not significantly different between the two groups. In our study, we did not evaluate the administration of cidofovir or adjuvant intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). In addition, there were no patients who received mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.
