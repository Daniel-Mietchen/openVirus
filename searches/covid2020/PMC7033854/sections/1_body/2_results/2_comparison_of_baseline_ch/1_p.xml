 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the baseline characteristics of the patients in the Adv and Non-Adv groups at admission. The median age was 21.6 years, and all patients were healthy males prior to the onset of illness. The number of current smokers was significantly higher in the Adv group than in the Non-Adv group (22.2% vs. 5.4%, respectively), with recent smokers (&lt; 30 days) only identified in the Adv group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4). A few patients had an underlying disease, such as asthma (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), allergic rhinitis (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), and pneumothorax (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2). No differences in the duration of symptoms and the time from symptom onset to admission were observed between the two groups (3.6 ± 1.8 d 
 <italic>vs. </italic>3.2 ± 2.3 d, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.224). All patients had clinical symptoms and signs of upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Adv group patients showed more symptomatic instabilities, such as fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and nasal congestion. At admission, initial vital signs and pneumonia severity index (PSI) scores were not significantly different between the two groups.
