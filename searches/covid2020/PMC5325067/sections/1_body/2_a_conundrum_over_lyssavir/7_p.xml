<p>Alternatively, one can speculate that many viruses (including multiple bat RABVs in the Old World and non-RABV lyssaviruses in the New World) became extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleocene event 65 million years ago which, as estimated, wiped out 75% of all biologic species

 </sup>. As major reservoirs went extinct, so too the viral species adapted to them. Though lacking to date for lyssaviruses, progress in the field of paleovirology and applications to other members of the Mononegavirales support the contention of time scales for some ancient viruses in excess of tens of millions of years in age, co-evolving with their hosts
