<p>Early attempts to create a timescale for the natural history of lyssaviruses on the basis of substitution rates (molecular clocks) suggested that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of lyssaviruses existed 7,000 to 11,000 years ago but that the MRCA of the present RABV existed 900 to 1,500 years ago
