<p>All phylogroup I lyssaviruses circulate in bats. Among these, only RABV is also adapted to perpetuation in carnivores. Within phylogroup II, both Lagos bat virus (LBV) and Shimoni bat virus are bat-borne whereas the reservoir of Mokola virus (MOKV) remains unknown

Ikoma lyssavirus (IKOV) was isolated from an African civet, but phylogenetic relatedness of this virus to WCBV and LLEBV suggests that it might be a spill-over infection, such that IKOV is actually a bat-borne virus as well
