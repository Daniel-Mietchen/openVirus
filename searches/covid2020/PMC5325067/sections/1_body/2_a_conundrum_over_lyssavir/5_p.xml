<p>Other studies that used essentially the same approaches and similar or slightly larger datasets extended the MRCA of bat RABVs to 436 to 1,107 years

 </sup>. In general, evolutionary rates observed in a set of sequences exhibit time dependency and are increased toward the present because of the transient mutations yet to be removed by purifying selection. Therefore, substitution rates estimated during long time frames will be lower systematically than those obtained during short time frames. This effect is as strong as, or stronger than, purifying selection, which shapes virus evolution

 </sup>. In other words, timescale estimations based on substitution rates are useful only for the time frame encompassed by the sampling period but cannot be extrapolated easily for longer periods of time.
