<p>The evolutionary history of the lyssaviruses is very poorly understood. Common observations include strong purifying selection and neutral evolution of viral genomes

 </sup>. The substitution rates along lyssavirus genomes are similar between viruses from different species and between different viral genes, approximating 3.8 × 10 
 <sup>−5</sup> to 2.1 × 10 
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions per site per year

 </sup>. An episodic diversifying selection was suggested in some studies, under a mixed effects model of episodic (MEME) selection. However, such endeavors failed to identify specific amino acid substitutions involved in host shifts with subsequent virus adaptation to a new host species (with increased fitness and fixation of favorable mutations) and as such should be interpreted cautiously

 </sup>. This is not too surprising given that only the current sequences (sampled during the past 30 to 40 years from well-established reservoir species) were available for the analysis whereas the natural history of lyssavirus speciation is set in several orders of magnitude longer.
