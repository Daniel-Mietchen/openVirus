<p>Recently, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) moved toward a partial appropriation of binomial species nomenclature, which exists in other fields of taxonomy. However, the ICTV applied such naming inversely, so the genus name appears after the species name 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
 </sup>. An objective rationale for this change is somewhat difficult to fathom unless the ICTV is trying to underline the fact that “real” virions and the concept of viruses and viral species are totally different entities. Although virions are observed by electron microscopy, no one has ever seen a “virus”. Virions are particulate, whereas viruses are conceptual populations of microorganisms, and more so virus species are “polythetic classes” (or fabricated “containers”) in which certain agents are placed artificially on the basis of their genetic, morphological, and physio-chemical properties

  <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
 </sup>. In other fields of biology, one would use the scientific name of an organism as the synonym for its species, but in virus taxonomy this is not the case. For example, now RABV belongs to the type species of the 
 <italic>Lyssavirus</italic> genus, termed 
 <italic>Rabies lyssavirus</italic>. So speaking in general of the virus as an organism, one still uses the former, whereas the latter is employed in a taxonomic context only. Inherited operational difficulties of use—for example, RABV (a virus) but 
 <italic>Rabies lyssavirus</italic> (a species); Mokola virus (a virus) but 
 <italic>Mokola lyssavirus</italic> (a species) and so on, also noting that virus names, but not species names, can be abbreviated—may lead to further changes of this binomial nomenclature in future years
