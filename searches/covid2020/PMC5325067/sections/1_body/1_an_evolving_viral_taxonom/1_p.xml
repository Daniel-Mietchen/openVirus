<p>Taxonomy, a formal attempt at objective, systematic classification and naming of entities in the complex milieu of life on earth, represented by plants, animals, and so on, also extends to the microbiological arena. Both RABV and a group of phylogenetically related viruses (all of which cause the acute progressive encephalomyelitis known as rabies) belong to the genus 
 <italic>Lyssavirus</italic>, within the family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> and the order Mononegavirales, the single-stranded, non-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses. With active surveillance and technical advances offered by next-generation sequencing, the taxonomy of the 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> is developing with increased complexity and new rhabdoviruses are being characterized 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
 </sup>. However, although new lyssaviruses are also being described, the genus forms a well-delineated cluster within the family and does not have any close relationships with other rhabdoviruses.
