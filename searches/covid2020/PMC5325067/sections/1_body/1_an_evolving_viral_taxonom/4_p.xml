<p>Globally, lyssaviruses have been subdivided into two phylogroups on the basis of genetic distances within their G-protein ectodomains and serologic cross-reactivity 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
 </sup>. Phylogroup I includes 
 <italic>Rabies lyssavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aravan lyssavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Australian bat lyssavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bokeloh lyssavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Duvenhage lyssavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>European bat lyssaviruses</italic>, 
 <italic>type 1</italic> and 
 <italic>type 2</italic>, 
 <italic>Irkut lyssavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Khujand lyssavirus</italic>, and the new Gannoruwa bat lyssavirus. Phylogroup II includes 
 <italic>Lagos bat lyssavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Mokola lyssavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Shimoni bat lyssavirus</italic>. The remaining 
 <italic>West Caucasian bat lyssavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ikoma lyssavirus</italic>, and Lleida bat lyssavirus are not included in either phylogroup. Although phylogenetically they do appear related, the amount of genetic divergence and absence of cross-neutralization do not allow placement in a single phylogroup on the basis of existing demarcation criteria 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
 </sup>. Genetic distances between lyssaviruses from different species are significantly shorter than those in other rhabdovirus genera. Therefore, other characters, such as antigenic reactivity patterns with monoclonal antibodies and ecologic properties (including distribution and host range), are used imperfectly for demarcation between the viral species 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 </sup>. This demarcation is based on expert opinion of a well-qualified taxonomic study group. With increasing ICTV debate toward unification of virus taxonomy based on genetic distances, in the near future there may be a re-classification attempt, in which all phylogroup I viruses are segregated into one species (for example, 
 <italic>Rabies lyssavirus</italic>?) and all phylogroup II viruses are segregated into another. Of course, such re-classification would miss important characteristics used for species demarcation at present and may have potential socio-economic or bio-political consequences for certain areas. For example, some places where RABV is not thought to circulate, such as in Australia or Western Europe (but where other lyssaviruses are present among bats), might lose their self-defined “rabies-free” status, on the basis of viral taxonomic re-organization, creating greater confusion, with potential public health, veterinary, or economic repercussions, if suddenly recast into the same disease status as Africa, Asia and the New World. Arguably, the term “rabies” appears to garner greater weight and seriousness than the less familiar designation “bat lyssavirus”.
