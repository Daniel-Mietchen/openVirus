<p>Alternatively, the person may be sent home to die. Cumulatively, since the 1970s, reports of very rare, non-fatal human cases (most with a history of vaccination) and the occasional spontaneous “survivor” during animal rabies studies suggested that clinical rabies may not always end in death, prompting the administration of aggressive anti-viral therapy

 </sup>. As a case in point, in 2004, a Wisconsin teenager bitten by a bat became the first unvaccinated survivor after intensive medical care, coma induction, and administration of anti-viral drugs

Nevertheless, the drive to act is understandable; such undertakings are compassionate and heroic attempts at treating the incurable. Who can witness the face of pathos in a Manila rabies ward and not be sensitized (

Although there has been sharp debate over the dangers of therapeutic coma and the merits of the Milwaukee protocol, the often-heated discussion has reinvigorated the field in a direction toward consideration of potential treatment administered to the patient with rabies

 </sup>. Asklepios is but one example of such a renaissance by a consortium of scientists whose focal research aims include the following: the identification of drugs that would inhibit RABV replication, the testing of molecules that may minimize detrimental host responses during RABV infection, the determination of whether alteration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability could improve treatment effectiveness, and validation of the potential success for such an approach

Regardless of technical insights, required expertise, the associated expense and related ethics of effort issues, there is also the prospect of survivorship with sequelae and the need for lengthy, potentially lifelong, rehabilitation and quality-of-life considerations

 </sup>. To make progress, whether in veterinary or human medicine, a more complete approach to rabies treatment should be taken, combining insights on rabies pathobiology gleaned from both experimental animal research and individual human case studies

 </sup>. Excellent clinical care by a dream team of specialists, anti-viral drugs incorporated from other RNA virus research, targeted immune modulation, the tincture of time, and a healthy dose of luck for appreciable self-cure in a patient with the ideal age, genetic pre-disposition, and clinical staging parameters may offer future hope to a more prescriptive treatment of rabies (
