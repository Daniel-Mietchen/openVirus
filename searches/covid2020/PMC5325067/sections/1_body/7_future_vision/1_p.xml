<p>Viral taxonomy may continue to adjust subjectively to changing times, differing philosophies, and bio-political pressure, yet regardless of the specific etiological names responsible for this disease, the moniker for rabies will remain. Theories on lyssavirus and host co-evolution will be complemented by methodological improvements and pathogen discovery. With enhanced, de-centralized laboratory-based surveillance and focused detection efforts, additional lyssavirus species and host shifts are expected. Stockpiling of vaccine and RIG, attention to existing recommendations, and careful risk assessments will increase the use of pre-exposure vaccination, maximize appropriate use of biologics in those truly exposed, and reduce PEP failures. Eventual application of the growing knowledge base on rabies pathogenetic mechanisms, pronounced intensive clinical skills in managing encephalitis, and the abilities to intervene with combinations of biologics and anti-viral drugs will gradually result in additional rabies survivors in human and veterinary medicine without losing the critical focus upon disease prevention. Ideally, under a progressive global business plan (with the minimum application of estimated biologics to the populations at risk, new champions, and dedicated sponsorships without vaccination fatigue), human rabies mediated by dogs should be eliminated in Latin America over the next 5 years, in Asia within a decade, and in Africa by 2030. Although eradication is not the aim, given a diversity of wildlife reservoirs and a lack of strategies to break the chain of perpetuation among the Chiroptera, the time is long overdue to accomplish such other ambitious goals against an ancient and insidious but neglected killer.</p>
