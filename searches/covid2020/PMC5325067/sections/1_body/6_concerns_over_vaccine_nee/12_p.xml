<p>Concerning dog rabies vaccines, their sustained availability at the ground level has repeatedly been shown to be essential to the initiation of dog rabies control activities

 </sup>. Essential steps to effectively increase veterinary rabies vaccine production to achieve human-dog-mediated rabies elimination by 2030 must be seriously considered by international organizations and vaccine manufacturers supporting this goal. These steps include accelerating technology transfer to Africa and Asia and redirecting some existing human rabies vaccine manufacturing capacities toward canine vaccine production, as proposed more than 30 years ago by a joint Rockefeller/WHO initiative

Similarly, GAVI support of human rabies vaccines might allow those eligible governments to use any conserved resources directed to veterinary public health, as begun regionally in the Americas in the 1980s. Comparatively modest investment in canine vaccination programs is predicted to have major cost-effective outcomes for the human rabies burden, even in some of the most severely affected areas
