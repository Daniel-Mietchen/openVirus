<p>There is relatively little production, technology development or transfer, import, and subsequent use of canine vaccines in dog rabies-enzootic countries. To prevent rabies in humans, manufacturers from the Northern Hemisphere and an increasing number of producers from emerging markets (for example, China and India) produce enough vaccine annually to deliver approximately 28 million rabies PEP courses in dog rabies-enzootic countries of Africa, Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region, preventing nearly 98% of human rabies deaths. Unfortunately, easier access to rabies vaccine, particularly in urban centers of Africa and Asia, has been accompanied by an increasing proportion of PEP (sometimes up to 70%) administered to people who are not at high risk of developing rabies, necessitating greater education and outreach to the public and professionals alike
