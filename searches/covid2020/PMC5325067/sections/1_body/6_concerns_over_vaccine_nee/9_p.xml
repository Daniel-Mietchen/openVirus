<p>Based on these estimates, almost 1.3 billion doses (more than 260 million doses annually including a 10% wastage rate) are needed from 2015 to 2019 for the attack phase in Asia and the Middle East. This is a conservative figure, as human populations of urban centers of China and India, which have almost a billion people and associated large dog populations, were excluded from this computation. In India, a special rabies control program targets major cities

 </sup>. In large Chinese cities, dog rabies prevalence is lower, but dog ownership laws (though somewhat relaxed recently and often difficult to enforce) may remain quite strict

 </sup>. In addition, 560 million doses are required from 2020 to 2024 (about 110 million doses annually) for the consolidation phase in these areas to initiate and conduct programs in Africa and maintain freedom in previously liberated areas. This means providing during the period of 2015–2019, on an annual basis, five times more dog vaccine to rural India and China, three times more for Eurasia, and two times more than currently used for the Eastern Mediterranean Region as well as five times more to the entire of Africa during the period of 2020–2024. Given the other existing priority market requirements, quantities needed in the short term (2015–2019) are likely to exceed major manufacturers’ capacities of scaling-up. In addition, as almost 50% of these dog vaccine doses are needed in South, South Eastern, and Eastern Asian countries, especially in China and India, current procurement mechanisms for pure, potent, safe, and efficacious vaccines, mostly involving Northern Hemisphere manufacturers’ production units, will not be acceptable by all.
