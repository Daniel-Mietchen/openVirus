<p>Dog vaccine requirements per country were aggregated by WHO regions and time periods. The results of estimated dog vaccine requirements by WHO regions and large countries (for example, China and India) are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>. For the European (Eurasia cluster), East Mediterranean, Asian, and Western Pacific WHO regions, the attack phase extends from 2015 to 2019; the consolidation phase from 2020 to 2022; and the maintenance phase from 2023 to 2024, as the target date for human rabies elimination here is 2020. Many countries in the above listed WHO regions particularly the Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions which carry a large part of the global human rabies burden have committed themselves to achieve the goal of human rabies elimination by 2020 and already scaled-up their dog and human rabies control activities (e.g Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam and parts of Indonesia, India &amp; China). For the African Region, the attack phase extends from 2020 to 2024; the consolidation phase from 2025 to 2027; and the maintenance phase from 2028 to 2029, as the target date for human rabies elimination here is 2030. The African region particularly sub-Saharan Africa will benefit from the full 10 year program plus preparatory time as the number of countries with experience of large-scale dog rabies immunization campaigns is comparatively small.
