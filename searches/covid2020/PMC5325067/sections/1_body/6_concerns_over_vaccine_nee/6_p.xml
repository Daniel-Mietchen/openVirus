<p>The number of vaccine doses needed in canine rabies-enzootic countries of the defined WHO Africa, Asia, Eurasia, and East Mediterranean regions were estimated in the medium (2015–2020) and longer (2020–2029) terms to achieve the goal of human and dog rabies elimination. As a given, these vaccines should comply with all international norms and standards
