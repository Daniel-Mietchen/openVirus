<p>Using the above population estimates to compute canine vaccine needs over time, we used a conservative 10-year country-based dog rabies elimination model divided into a 5-year attack phase, a 3-year consolidation phase, and a 2-year maintenance phase (with vaccination coverages decreasing from 70% to 20% and finally to 5% as the program moved from one phase to another). This model is based on both theoretical and field experiences

 </sup>. Understandably, national programs will progress at various paces. Some may need shorter or longer attack, consolidation, or maintenance phases than others. Ten years of sustained dog rabies immunization activities were considered long enough to bring human rabies cases down toward zero in most places, if carried out with the joint leadership of the countries and major international organizations
