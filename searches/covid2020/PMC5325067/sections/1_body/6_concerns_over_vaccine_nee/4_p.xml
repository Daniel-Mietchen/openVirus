<p>A canine rabies vaccine bank was established in 2012 by the World Animal Health Organization (OIE), with multi-donor support to assist Asian countries initiating (for example, Afghanistan, Laos, and Myanmar) or strengthening (for example, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam) their immunization campaigns

 </sup>. Though certainly useful, the quantities provided (about 3.7 million doses from 2012 to April 2015) have remained limited in comparison with annual requirements of full-fledged national programs in 10 Asian beneficiary countries. For example, over 3 years, Vietnam received a total of about 1 million doses, but nearly 10 million local dogs need to be vaccinated annually. Similarly, the WHO has expressed an intention of constructing a human rabies vaccine stockpile to rapidly provide quality-ensured vaccines upon request

Globally, human rabies vaccine quantities produced seem close to adequate, but at a country level, major challenges include the following: assessing unnecessary or inappropriately applied PEP, particularly in urban centers; bringing appropriately staffed “bite treatment centers” to needed communities; providing free or low-cost rabies biologics; and applying economical and easier-to-use PEP regimens to exposed patients
