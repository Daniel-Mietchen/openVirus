<p>To simplify the infectious cycle of rabies, exposure is direct, not by environmental deposition, but rather individual-to-individual intra- and inter-specific transmission, usually occurring via bite. Millions of highly neurotropic virions are excreted intermittently in the saliva of a rabid host, days to weeks before overt morbidity and eventual demise, entering the peripheral nervous system of a bite recipient. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic>, from local depots and centripetal transit in the axoplasm, primary replication occurs within neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). Thereafter, centrifugal passage occurs from the CNS to a number of highly innervated sites, including the salivary glands. Oral, mucosal, or transdermal delivery of virions occurs by normal daily mammalian interactions. Failing these routine modus operandi pathways, altered unusual behaviors offer a variety of options for secondary contacts. These may range from mania to paresis and paralysis, with deliberate transmission options of agonistic encounters and biting, increased movement outside of normal home range/territories, or acute death, with predation by others upon virion-laden tissues and organs of the affected host. If a productive infection ensues, the entry-reproduction-exit cycle is poised to begin anew after initiation, taking days, weeks, months, or (rarely) years of incubation before excretion or obvious clinical manifestation. Such obligate, parasitic virions ensure elegant self-transfer by exploitation of the normal through to the bizarre. Relatively distant viral familial relatives hail among invertebrates and plants, but warm-blooded vertebrates are the rabies-prone hosts. Although these agents predated 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, their current distribution, abundance, and diversity likely exceed pre-historic comparisons, especially mediated during the Anthropocene period.
