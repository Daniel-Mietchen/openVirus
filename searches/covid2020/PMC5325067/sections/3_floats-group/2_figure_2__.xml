  <title>Proposed lyssavirus radiations.</title>
  <p>Highly speculative schematic depiction of the ancient spread of proto-lyssaviruses on a proposed map of the continents as they were present during the late Cretaceous period. Solid lines show hypothetical directions of lyssavirus ancestor distribution at that time, and dashed lines show further spread thereafter with additional continental drift. Although the “out of Africa” hypothesis dominates the scheme, this does not discount the potential role of Antarctica in biogeographic dispersal with bat-virus links to both Australia and South America as suggested for other pathogens
