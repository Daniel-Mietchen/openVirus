 <caption>
  <p>The pathogen pyramid (adapted from [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C30">30</xref>]). Each level represents a different degree of interaction between pathogens and humans, ranging from exposure through to epidemic spread. Some pathogens are able to progress from one level to the next (arrows); others are prevented from doing so by biological or ecological barriers (bars)—see main text.
