<p>Of course, not all newly identified human virus species are ‘new’ in the sense that they have only recently started to infect humans; many of them have been present in humans for a considerable time but have only recently been recognized (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C2">2</xref>] for a more detailed discussion). Moreover, we recognize that ‘species’ itself is an imprecise designation, especially for viruses such as influenza A where different serotypes can have very different epidemiologies and health impacts. Indeed, the demarcation between genus, species complex, species and serotype (or other designations of sub-specific variation) can be somewhat arbitrary. Nonetheless, a study of currently recognized ‘species’ is a natural starting point for attempts to characterize and interpret patterns of virus diversity.
