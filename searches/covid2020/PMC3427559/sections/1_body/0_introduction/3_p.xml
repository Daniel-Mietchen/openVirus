<p>In this paper, we take an ecological approach to studying the diversity of human viruses (defined as viruses for which there is evidence of natural infection of humans). First, we describe and analyse temporal, geographical and taxonomic patterns in the discovery of human viruses (§2). We then consider the processes by which new human viruses emerge (§3). There are a number of definitions of ‘emergence’ [

As experiences with HIV-1 and new variants of influenza A (and also with novel animal pathogens such as canine parvovirus [
