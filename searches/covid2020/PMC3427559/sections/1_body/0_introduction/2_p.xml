<p>Following on from the discovery of tobacco mosaic virus in 1892 and foot-and-mouth disease virus in 1898, the first ‘filterable agent’ to be discovered in humans was yellow fever virus in 1901 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C1">1</xref>]. New species of human virus are still being identified, at a rate of three or four per year (see below), and viruses make up over two-thirds of all new human pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C2">2</xref>], a highly significant over-representation given that most human pathogen species are bacteria, fungi or helminths. These new viruses differ wildly in their importance, ranging from the rare and mild illness due to Menangle virus to the devastating public health impact of HIV-1.
