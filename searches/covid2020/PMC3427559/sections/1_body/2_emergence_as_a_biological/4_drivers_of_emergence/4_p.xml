<p>A slightly different way of thinking about drivers of emergence is to draw an analogy between emerging pathogens and weeds (A. Dobson 2002, personal communication). The idea here is that there is a sufficient diversity of pathogens available—each with their own biology and epidemiology—that 
 <italic>any</italic> change in the human environment (but especially in the way that humans interact with other animals, domestic or wild) is likely to favour one pathogen or another, which responds by invading the newly accessible habitat. This idea would imply that emerging pathogens possess different life-history characteristics to established, long-term endemic pathogens. As noted earlier, the most striking difference identified so far is that the majority of recently emerging pathogens are viruses rather than bacteria, fungi, protozoa or helminths.
