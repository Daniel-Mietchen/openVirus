<p>A broad host range is also associated with the likelihood of a pathogen emerging or re-emerging in human populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C26">26</xref>]. An illustrative case study is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). After BSE's emergence in the 1980s, well before it was found to infect humans (as vCJD), it rapidly became apparent that it could infect a wide range of hosts, including carnivores. This was in marked contrast to a much more familiar prion disease, scrapie, which was naturally restricted to sheep and goats. With hindsight, this observation might have led to public health concerns about BSE being raised earlier than they were.
