<p>Two recent studies provide good illustrations of the roles of host relatedness and geographical proximity. Streicker 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C38">38</xref>] found associations between the degree of cross-species transmission of bat lyssaviruses and both the geographical overlap between bat populations across the USA and the phylogenetically relatedness of the bat species involved. Davies &amp; Pedersen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C39">39</xref>] found that primate species tended to share more parasite species if they were both more closely related and had sympatric distributions.
