<p>The remaining viruses, as far as we are aware, only naturally infect humans (these are sometimes referred to as ‘specialist’ human pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C27">27</xref>]). Some of these (e.g. hepatitis B) may have co-evolved with humans over very long time periods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C28">28</xref>]; others (e.g. HIV-1) have much more recent origins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C29">29</xref>]. Some of both kinds are believed to have originated in other mammal or bird species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C30">30</xref>], including: HIV-1 (derived from a simian immunodeficiency virus found in chimpanzees); HIV-2 (sooty mangabeys); severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS; horseshoe bats); hepatitis B, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 and -2, dengue and yellow fever (all primates); human coronavirus OC43, measles, mumps and smallpox (all livestock); and influenza A (wildfowl). However, we do not know the origins of the majority of specialist human viruses, a gap in knowledge that has prompted calls for an ‘origins initiative’ [
