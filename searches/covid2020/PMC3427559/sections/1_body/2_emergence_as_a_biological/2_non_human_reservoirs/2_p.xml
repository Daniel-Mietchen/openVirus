<p>More than two-thirds of human virus species are zoonotic, i.e. they are capable of infecting vertebrate hosts other than

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C26">26</xref>]. By far the most important non-human host taxa are other mammals, with rodents and ungulates most commonly identified as alternative hosts, followed by primates, carnivores and bats. A minority of the zoonotic viruses (less than 20%) are also known to infect birds; very few have been reported from vertebrates other than mammals or birds.
