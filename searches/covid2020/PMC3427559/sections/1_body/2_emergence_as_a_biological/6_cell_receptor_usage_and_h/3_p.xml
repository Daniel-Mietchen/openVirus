<p>To test this idea, we first carried out a comprehensive review of the peer reviewed literature and identified 88 human virus species for which at least one cell receptor has been identified. Although this is only 40 per cent of the species of interest, 21 (of 23) families were represented; so this set contains a good cross-section of relevant taxonomic diversity. Of these 88 species, 22 use non-protein receptors (e.g. heparin sulphate) and, of the remainder, two of the proteins were not entered in the UniProt database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C40">40</xref>] (making it impossible to determine whether the protein was ‘conserved’ or not—see below for details), leaving 64 species from 16 families.
