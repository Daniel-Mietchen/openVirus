<p>The result is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20110354F4">figure 4</xref>. The most striking feature of the plot is that there are no examples of human viruses with broad host ranges that do not use highly conserved cell receptors (i.e. more than 90% amino acid sequence homology). Statistical analyses requires correction for phylogenetic correlation: viruses in the same family are both more likely to use the same cell receptor and more likely to have a narrow or broad host range. This can be crudely (but conservatively) allowed for by testing for an association between host range and receptor homology at the family, not species, level. This gives a statistically significant result (
