<p>On the basis of a previously published study of virus host ranges [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C26">26</xref>], we accorded these viruses either a ‘narrow’ host range (if the only non-human hosts they were known to infect were other primates) or a ‘broad’ host range (if they were known to infect also other kinds mammals or birds). Using the UniProt database, we determined whether the cell receptor protein was ‘conserved’ by quantifying the amino acid sequence homology between humans and mice. (For the subset of proteins where amino acid sequences data were also available for cows, pigs or dogs, we found very similar patterns.)
