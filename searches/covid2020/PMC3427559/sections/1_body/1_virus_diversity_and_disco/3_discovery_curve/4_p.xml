<p>Piecewise linear regression revealed two statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) upswings in the rate of virus discovery: in 1930 (95% confidence intervals (CIs) 1927–1933) and in 1954 (1952–1955). Since 1954 the mean rate of discovery has been 3.37 species per year with variance 3.35, consistent with a Poisson process. However, there has been a slight but statistically significant downward trend in the rate of discovery (a linear regression of (count per year)
