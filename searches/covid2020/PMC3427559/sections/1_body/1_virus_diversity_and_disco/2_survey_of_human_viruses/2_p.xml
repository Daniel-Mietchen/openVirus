<p>As a starting point for our survey, we used a previously published database (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C5">5</xref>]) obtained by systematically searching the primary scientific literature up to and including 2005 for reports of human infection with recognized virus species, using species as defined by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C6">6</xref>]. The list of viruses was updated if either a new species that can infect humans had been described in the literature and also recognized by the ICTV, if a known species had been found in humans for the first time, or if there had been a change in species classifications by the ICTV (notably for the human papillomaviruses and the vesicular stomatitis viruses).
