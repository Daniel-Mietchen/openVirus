<p>Numbers of species discovered by continent are shown in

 <italic>a</italic> (ignoring four species for which the location of discovery could not be determined). That over 60 per cent of species were first discovered in North America or Europe almost certainly reflects considerable ascertainment bias [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C10">10</xref>]. Rates of discovery by continent have, perhaps unsurprisingly, been very variable through time but with no clear patterns; the only notable trend in the last 15 years has been a higher rate of discovery in Australasia.
