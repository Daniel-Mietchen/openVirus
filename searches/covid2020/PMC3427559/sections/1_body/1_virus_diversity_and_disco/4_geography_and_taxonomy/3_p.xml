<p>Numbers of species by family are shown in

 <italic>b</italic>. The family containing the most human virus species is the Bunyaviridae with 40; six families contain just one human virus species. These numbers are too small for statistical analysis of rates of discovery: the most notable trend is that only a single new pox virus has been discovered since 1972 (compared with 10 up to that date). Nor are there any striking patterns using other classifications such as RNA viruses versus DNA viruses.
