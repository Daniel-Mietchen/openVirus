<p>The discovery curve for virus families is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20110354F1">figure 1</xref>
 <italic>b</italic>. Here, a family is included on the date of the first published report of human infection by a virus species from that family. There is too little data (
 <italic>n</italic> = 23) for detailed statistical analysis, but the figure does suggest a possible decrease in the rate of discovery, implying that the pool of undiscovered families may be relatively modest (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C5">5</xref>]).
