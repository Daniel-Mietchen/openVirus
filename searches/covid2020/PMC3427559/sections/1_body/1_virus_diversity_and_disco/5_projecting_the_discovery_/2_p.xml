<p>Following the approach described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C5">5</xref>], we modelled human virus discovery since 1954, assuming a total number of species available to be discovered—the species pool—of 
 <italic>N</italic> virus species, each discovered in any given year with probability 
 <italic>p</italic>. We considered fitting a distribution for values of 
 <italic>p</italic>; however, provided that the individual 
 <italic>p</italic> values are low, there was minimal improvement in model fit. The model was fitted to the data and evaluated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with flat prior information to calculate profile likelihood confidence intervals and the best fit parameters. The model defines the expected number of discovered viruses in year 
 <italic>t</italic>, 
 <italic>λ
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic>, as binomially distributed so that
