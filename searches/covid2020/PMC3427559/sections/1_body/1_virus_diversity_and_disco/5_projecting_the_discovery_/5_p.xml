<p>To make shorter term projections, the model was extrapolated to year 2020, calculating 95% posterior prediction intervals using 2 million model simulations, taking into account parameter uncertainty and model stochasticity. An upper limit for 
 <italic>N</italic> was set at the 90% upper confidence interval. This gave a projected number of new virus species of 36 (95% CIs 20â€“57), corresponding to an average 2.4 species per year. This projection, of course, makes no allowance for any improvements in virus detection technology nor changes in discovery effort.
