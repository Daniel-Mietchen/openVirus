<p>From our systematic literature review, we identified at least 14 putative new species of human virus first reported during the 5 years 2005 to 2009 inclusive (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSTB20110354TB2">table 2</xref>), though this list is almost certainly incomplete. Clearly (subject to recognition of these new viruses as distinct ‘species’ by the ICTV), the projection described in §2
 <italic>d</italic> looks likely to be met. Indeed, it would be unsurprising if it were exceeded, given the considerable recent interest in virus discovery and the advent of high throughput sequencing as a detection tool.
