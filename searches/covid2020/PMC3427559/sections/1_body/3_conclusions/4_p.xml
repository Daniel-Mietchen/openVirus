<p>The first line of defence against emerging viruses is effective surveillance. This topic has been widely discussed in recent years [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C41">41</xref>], but we will re-iterate a few key points here. Firstly, emerging viruses are everyone's problem: the ease with which viruses can disperse, potentially worldwide within days, coupled with the very wide geographical distribution of emergence events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C9">9</xref>], means that a coordinated, global surveillance network is essential if we are to ensure rapid detection of novel viruses. This immediately highlights the enormous national and regional differences in detection capacity, with the vast majority of suitable facilities located in Europe or North America. Secondly, reporting of unusual disease events is patchy, even once detected, reflecting both governance issues and lack of incentives [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSTB20110354C10">10</xref>]. Thirdly, we need to consider extending the surveillance effort to other mammal populations as well as humans, because these are the most likely source of new human viruses.
