<p>We included the results of all respiratory virus tests conducted by participating laboratories. The laboratories used monoplex and multiplex PCR assays, viral culture, direct immunofluorescence assay, or enzyme immunoassay tests to test for one or more of the following viruses: adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus [

For participants tested multiple times in the same season, we included their earliest testing episode positive for influenza (or their earliest testing episode if all specimens tested negative for influenza) for analysis.

Specimens were submitted at the discretion of clinicians as part of routine clinical care. The proportion of patients presenting with acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) who were tested for influenza varied by setting (22.1% for inpatients, 2.5% for patients in emergency departments, and 2.3% for patients in physician offices) [
