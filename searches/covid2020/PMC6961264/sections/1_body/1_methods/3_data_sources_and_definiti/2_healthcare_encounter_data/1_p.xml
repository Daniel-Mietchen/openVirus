<p>We identified all healthcare encounters associated with a specimen on the date of collection using the Canadian Institute for Health Informationâ€™s Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI-DAD), the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) database, and the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) database. The proportion of missing data in each of the healthcare use databases should be very low since healthcare is universally covered for those with provincial health insurance.</p>
