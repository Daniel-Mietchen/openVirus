<p>We used logistic regression to estimate VE, against laboratory-confirmed influenza infection, by comparing the odds of vaccination in the test-positive cases to the odds of vaccination in the test-negative controls through an odds ratio (OR) and using the following formula VE = (1 − OR) × 100%. The models controlled for the demographic characteristics and measures of previous healthcare use listed above, presence of any comorbidity, calendar time (month of test), and influenza season (except when estimating VE by season). These variables were selected a priori and were included because of their clinical importance and conceptualisation as potential confounders. We used a threshold level of 5% test positivity for the province to restrict the analyses to periods when influenza was circulating.</p>
