<p>We conducted a number of sensitivity analyses. First, we restricted the cohort to patients who had a diagnostic code for an ARI [
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] for their healthcare encounter, to emulate case definitions used in prospective test-negative studies. Second, we restricted the cohort to patients who were tested by PCR. Third, since Ontario residents may receive influenza vaccines in settings besides physician offices and pharmacies (leading to incorrectly classifying individuals vaccinated outside of these settings as unvaccinated), for each of the above analyses we conducted a quantitative sensitivity analysis using a publicly available macro [
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to correct for misclassification of influenza vaccination status using previously reported parameters for sensitivity (69%) and specificity (90%) of influenza vaccination codes for older adults in Ontario health administrative databases [
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This macro performs multiple iterations of exposure re-classification for each execution. For each iteration, sensitivity and specificity values within the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the previously reported parameters are selected. Using these values and the observed counts of exposed cases and controls, expected counts are determined to calculate a positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for cases and controls separately. PPV is the probability that the individual was correctly classified as exposed, whereas NPV is the probability that an individual was correctly classified as unexposed. For each individual, a random number is chosen from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, and compared with the predictive value based on their case and exposure statuses. If the random number is greater than the predictive value, the subject is reclassified [
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. An OR is calculated using the reclassified exposure value for each iteration, and the median OR from the distribution of ORs from all iterations is reported [
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This macro does not permit incorporation of interaction terms with the main exposure to do an interaction test between subgroups.
