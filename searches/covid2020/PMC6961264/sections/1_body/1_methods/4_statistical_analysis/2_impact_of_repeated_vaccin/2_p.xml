<p>For each analysis, we stratified the study population based on individuals’ vaccination history (i.e. number of previous vaccinations received) and we estimated current season VE conditioned on vaccination history. Therefore, the reference group for estimating VE is patients who share similar vaccination histories as those who are vaccinated in the current season but are unvaccinated in the current season. For example, we compared patients who had received 9–10 previous vaccinations and who were vaccinated in the current season to those who had received 9–10 previous vaccinations but who were not vaccinated in the current season. The rationale for this approach is that it quantifies the incremental benefit of vaccination in the current season, and acknowledges that since a patient cannot change his/her past vaccination status, comparing to those not vaccinated in the current nor any past season may not be appropriate. Ultimately, this provides more patient-centred results as it aligns with the decision that needs to be made by patients each season regarding the benefit of receiving the current season’s vaccine.</p>
