<p>In sensitivity analyses, we corrected for misclassification of current season vaccination status. For the macro programme to successfully execute, we assumed the same values of sensitivity and specificity for all strata of past vaccination history. We repeated the analyses restricted to patients aged ≥ 75 years in the current season for greater consistency of the VE estimates across the varying vaccination history durations. We also conducted sensitivity analyses in which we manually reclassified past vaccination status for those who were misclassified for the current season based on the macro programme (details in

In the first scenario, we changed vaccination status from unvaccinated to vaccinated for all previous seasons, effectively moving all misclassified individuals into the most vaccinated category in terms of vaccination history. In the second scenario, we moved individuals ‘up’ a single category (e.g. for the analysis examining 5-year vaccination history, those initially considered vaccinated in none of the previous five seasons were re-categorised to the ‘vaccinated in 1–3 of the previous five seasons’ group).
