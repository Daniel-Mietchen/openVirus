We used personal identifiers (health card number, name, date of birth, sex, postal code) and a combination of deterministic and probabilistic methods to link the results of respiratory virus tests performed by a network of 19 public health and academic hospital laboratories to population-based provincial health administrative data (linkage proportion = 97.8%) [
