<p>It remains unclear whether true vaccine interference is occurring from repeated vaccination or whether the differences between studies are an artefact of residual confounding [
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Individuals may be more inclined to be vaccinated for the first time if they were infected by influenza in the prior season. Vaccine responses may be enhanced with recent prior infection [
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], such that those who were vaccinated repeatedly may appear to have lower VE. However, measuring immunity arising from previous infection is challenging [
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, while pooling of multiple seasons can increase statistical power, it can mask important variation at the individual season level [
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, a large knowledge gap persists regarding the immunologic mechanisms for potential vaccine interference. Future studies that longitudinally ascertain both influenza vaccination and influenza infection status over multiple seasons would be helpful to better understand the impact of repeated vaccination on current season VE as well as residual protection from previous vaccination.
