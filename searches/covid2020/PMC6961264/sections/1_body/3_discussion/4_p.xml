<p>This study has several limitations. First, the specimens were not collected through systematic screening and enrollment but rather as part of routine clinical care. However, we have validated the use of these specimens for estimating VE [
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Second, while test-negative studies typically use symptom onset date as the index date, we were limited to using specimen collection date. This may have led to underestimation of VE. Third, the VE estimate against unsubtyped influenza A was outside of the range between those against A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), raising the possibility of potential bias. Although only 49% of individuals positive for influenza A had their specimens subtyped, they are fairly representative of all individuals positive for influenza A (

We speculate that the lower VE observed for unsubtyped specimens may be due to a greater proportion being collected during the 2014/15 season (a season with known poor match) and during later months of influenza season (with potentially lower VE due to intra-season waning of immunity). Fourth, receipt of influenza vaccines outside of physician offices and pharmacies leads to misclassification of vaccination status when relying on health administrative data to ascertain vaccination status. However, healthcare-seeking behaviour has been found to be similar between test-positive and test-negative individuals [
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], so any misclassification would likely be non-differential and underestimate VE, as demonstrated in our sensitivity analyses. The low sensitivity value for the influenza vaccination billing claims used in these sensitivity analyses may have resulted from bias given the self-reported nature of the reference standard available for validation of the claims data, or because pharmacist billing claims data were not yet available for inclusion in the validation study [
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Fifth, the macro programme used for our sensitivity analysis could not include interaction terms with the main exposure to determine whether subgroup similarities/differences in VE were maintained after misclassification was corrected, and could only correct for misclassification of current season vaccination status and not misclassification in past seasons. However, our sensitivity analyses involving reclassification of past vaccination based on misclassification of current season vaccination status found very similar trends as when accounting only for current season misclassification. Sixth, we used the same values of sensitivity and specificity of the vaccination billing claims for all strata of past vaccination history because we did not have stratum-specific parameters. The observed trend might not remain if the magnitude of the bias correction varies by past vaccination history. Seventh, our use of meta-regression to assess for trends in VE estimates between vaccination history strata does not capture season-to-season heterogeneity in terms of circulating viruses, vaccine match, and host-virus immunological interactions. Eighth, we did not have information on participants’ influenza infections in the previous seasons, as most infections do not result in laboratory testing. Ninth, we did not have information on vaccination history for &gt; 10 previous influenza seasons; the impact of repeated vaccination over longer periods of time remain unknown. Finally, as an observational study, the possibility of residual confounding remains.
