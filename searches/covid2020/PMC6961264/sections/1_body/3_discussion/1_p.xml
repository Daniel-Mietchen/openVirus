<p>In this study of older adults, we estimated VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza healthcare use to be 21% (95%CI: 18 to 24%) during the 2010/11 to 2015/16 influenza seasons, which increased to 38% (95%CI: 35 to 42%) after correcting for misclassification of vaccination status. When we examined the impact of repeated vaccination during previous influenza seasons on VE for the current season, we observed a declining trend in VE as the number of previous vaccinations increased. Nevertheless, influenza vaccination during the current season was associated with some protection against influenza infection irrespective of the number of vaccinations over the previous 10 seasons, except for individuals vaccinated 9–10 times before we corrected for misclassification of vaccination status. After correcting for misclassification of vaccination status in the current season, influenza vaccination was associated with some protection even for those vaccinated 9–10 times during the previous 10 seasons. Reassuringly, the overall observed trends in VE were consistent when correcting for this misclassification, both for the current season only and when manually reclassifying vaccination status during past seasons based on current season misclassification. Similar patterns as any influenza were observed against A(H3N2) but not A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza B, but interpretation of these results is challenging due to lower case counts for the latter analyses leading to less precision. The observed patterns for any influenza were likely driven by A(H3N2) since that subtype comprised 67% of specimens during the influenza seasons included in this study, if one assumes the subtype distribution for unsubtyped specimens is the same as for subtyped specimens. We noted that for patients who were not vaccinated in the current season, residual protection appeared to increase with increasing numbers of vaccines received during previous seasons. We also demonstrated that being vaccinated in the current season resulted in consistently greater protection, compared with not being vaccinated in the current season, regardless of the number of previous vaccinations.</p>
