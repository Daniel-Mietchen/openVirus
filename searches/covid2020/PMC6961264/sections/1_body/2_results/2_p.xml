<p>Overall adjusted VE against any influenza for the 2010/11 to 2015/16 seasons combined was 21% (95%CI: 18 to 24%) (

 </xref>). For the six seasons combined, VE was 38% (95%CI: 28 to 46%) against A(H1N1)pdm09, 22% (95%CI: 16 to 28%) against A(H3N2), and 30% (95%CI: 24 to 36%) against B. VE against unsubtyped influenza A viruses was only 11% (95%CI: 5 to 16%). We observed substantial variability in VE by season (interaction test p &lt; 0.001), by age group (p = 0.01), and by sex (p = 0.03), but not by healthcare setting (p = 0.60). After correcting for misclassification of vaccination status, VE for the six seasons combined increased to 38% (95%CI: 35 to 42%) against any influenza. We observed similar results when restricting the analysis to ARI-coded healthcare encounters and to patients tested by PCR (
