<p>Using the conventional approach of comparing to a common reference group, VE did not differ substantially for patients vaccinated in both prior and current seasons (25%; 95%CI: 22 to 29%) and those vaccinated in the current season only (29%; 95%CI: 23 to 34%) (interaction test p = 0.31), but was lower for those vaccinated in the prior season only (18%; 95%CI: 13 to 23%) (p &lt; 0.001) (

When accounting for 5-year vaccination history, significant protection against influenza was observed among patients with any previous vaccination, with or without current season vaccination. Notably, for similar levels of vaccination in previous seasons, receipt of current season vaccination was associated with higher VE estimates than being unvaccinated in the current season. VE decreased for current vaccine recipients as the number of previous vaccinations received increased (i.e. 36% vs 31% vs 26%) (trend test p = 0.007). In contrast, for those not vaccinated in the current season, residual protection increased as the number of previous vaccinations received increased (i.e. 13% vs 17%) (p &lt; 0.001). Similar patterns were observed when considering 10-year vaccination history, with VE decreasing for current vaccine recipients with increasing numbers of previous vaccinations (from 33% to 22%) (p &lt; 0.001), while the opposite trend in residual protection was observed for those without current season vaccination (from 9% to 16%) (p &lt; 0.001).
