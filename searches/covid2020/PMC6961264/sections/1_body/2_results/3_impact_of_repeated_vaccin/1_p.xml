<p>Patients who had received more vaccinations in previous seasons were older and more likely to be male, use health services, and have comorbidities, although the magnitudes of the differences between groups were small (

In the analysis accounting for 5-year vaccination history, patients who had received no vaccinations in the previous five seasons had the highest VE for current season vaccination (37%; 95%CI: 22 to 48%), with lower but still significant VE estimates for patients who had received 1–3 (20%; 95%CI: 13 to 26%) and 4–5 (10%; 95%CI: 3 to 17%) vaccinations in the previous five seasons (trend test p = 0.001). Similar results were observed when accounting for 10-year vaccination history: patients who had received no vaccinations in the previous 10 seasons had the highest VE for current season vaccination (34%; 95%CI: 9 to 52%), with VE decreasing with more previous vaccinations received over the previous 10 seasons: 26% (95%CI: 13 to 37%) for those vaccinated 1–3 times, 24% (95%CI: 15 to 33%) for those vaccinated 4–6 times, 13% (95%CI: 2 to 22%) for those vaccinated 7–8 times, and 7% (95%CI: −4 to 16%) for those vaccinated 9–10 times (trend test p = 0.001).
