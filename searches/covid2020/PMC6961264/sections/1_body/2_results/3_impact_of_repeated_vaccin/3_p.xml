<p>When correcting for misclassification of current season vaccination status, we found similar patterns as the primary analysis, but with VE estimates that were higher in magnitude (

After correcting for misclassification of current season vaccination status within this restricted cohort, VE estimates were higher but the overall trends were consistent (

Results were similar when manually reclassifying vaccination status in past seasons based on current season misclassification (
