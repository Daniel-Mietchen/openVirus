<p>Two studies examined the impact of repeated vaccination for five previous seasons. Whereas McLean et al. observed current season VE to be higher in those who were not vaccinated in any of the previous five seasons compared with those who were vaccinated in all five previous seasons [
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Ã–rtqvist et al. found no negative effect of repeated vaccination [
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, the effect of repeated vaccination beyond one previous season also remains unclear. This is of particular interest for older adults because not only do they bear the greatest burden of disease, but they are also recommended to receive the vaccine annually in most countries and therefore may have received many doses.
