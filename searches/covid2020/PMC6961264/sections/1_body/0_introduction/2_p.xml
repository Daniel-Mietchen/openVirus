<p>However, the impact of repeated vaccination on vaccine effectiveness (VE) is uncertain. A randomised trial (RCT) conducted in the 1970s at a British boarding school found higher influenza incidence among students who had received multiple previous vaccines than among those who received only the current seasonâ€™s vaccine [

Based on the antigenic distance hypothesis put forth by Smith et al., negative or positive interference can result from prior season vaccination depending on differences in the antigenic distances between prior and current vaccine strains and the current epidemic strain [
