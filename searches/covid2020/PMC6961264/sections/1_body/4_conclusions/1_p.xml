<p>In summary, we observed modest VE for community-dwelling older adults in Ontario, Canada during the 2010/11 to 2015/16 influenza seasons. We observed declining VE associated with repeated vaccination, however current season vaccination likely provides some protection against influenza regardless of the number of vaccines received over the previous 10 influenza seasons. Moreover, among those not vaccinated in the current season, increasing residual protection was observed with increasing numbers of previous vaccines received. Therefore, until effective universal influenza vaccines are available and eliminate the need for annual influenza vaccination, our findings support current recommendations for annual vaccination among older adults given their higher risk for influenza-related morbidity and mortality.</p>
