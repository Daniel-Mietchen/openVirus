         <p>Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for older adults, but evidence regarding
            the impact of repeated vaccination has been inconclusive.

         <p>We investigated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza
            and the impact of repeated vaccination over 10 previous seasons on current season
            VE among older adults.

         <p>We conducted an observational test-negative study in community-dwelling adults aged &gt; 65 years
            in Ontario, Canada for the 2010/11 to 2015/16 seasons by linking laboratory and health
            administrative data. We estimated VE using multivariable logistic regression. We assessed
            the impact of repeated vaccination by stratifying by previous vaccination history.

      <div class="results" title="sec">
         <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Results</div>
         <p>We included 58,304 testing episodes for respiratory viruses, with 11,496 (20%) testing
            positive for influenza and 31,004 (53%) vaccinated. Adjusted VE against laboratory-confirmed
            influenza for the six seasons combined was 21% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18 to 24%).
            Patients who were vaccinated in the current season, but had received no vaccinations
            in the previous 10 seasons, had higher current season VE (34%; 95%CI: 9 to 52%) than
            patients who had received 1–3 (26%; 95%CI: 13 to 37%), 4–6 (24%; 95%CI: 15 to 33%),
            7–8 (13%; 95%CI: 2 to 22%), or 9–10 (7%; 95%CI: −4 to 16%) vaccinations (trend test
            p = 0.001). All estimates were higher after correcting for misclassification of current
            season vaccination status. For patients who were not vaccinated in the current season,
            residual protection rose significantly with increasing numbers of vaccinations received
            previously.

         <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Conclusions</div>
         <p>Although VE appeared to decrease with increasing numbers of previous vaccinations,
            current season vaccination likely provides some protection against influenza regardless
            of the number of vaccinations received over the previous 10 influenza seasons.
