<p>Nitazoxanide (NTZ) was originally developed and licensed as an antiprotozoal drug for the treatment of enteritis caused by 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and 
 <italic>Giardia</italic> infections. Nitazoxanide is a thiazolide compound that is rapidly deacetylated in the blood to the active metabolic form tizoxanide (

The mechanism of action against influenza virus is achieved by impairing the trafficking of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and by blocking HA terminal glycosylation leading to block maturation of the HA (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> including avian influenza viruses (

 <xref rid="ref120" ref-type="bibr">Rossignol, 2009</xref>). A phase 2b/3 clinical trial (NCT01227421) aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of NTZ in the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza established that treatment with 300 mg twice a day for 5 days was well tolerated and it was associated with a reduction of symptoms and infectious viral load (

 <xref rid="ref135" ref-type="bibr">Stachulski et al., 2018</xref>) in the treatment of uncomplicated influenza was concluded in March 2019 but results have not been posted.
