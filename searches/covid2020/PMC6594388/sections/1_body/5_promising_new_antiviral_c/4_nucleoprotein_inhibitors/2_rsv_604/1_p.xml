<p>RSV604 is a small molecule with submicromolar RSV activity that was discovered through chemical optimization of an RSV high-throughput screen hit (
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al., 2007</xref>). It is effective against both RSV A and B replication at a post-entry step. The antiviral mechanism of this compound is related to its binding to the RSV N protein and therefore inhibition of both RNA synthesis and the infectivity of released virus (
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Challa et al., 2015</xref>). A phase 2a clinical trial in stem cell transplant patients with RSV infection showed that following treatment with RSV604, plasma exposure reached the 90% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>90</sub>). In addition, patients had a reduction in viral titers and RSV infection symptoms (
