<p>The use of plasma obtained from recovering patients (convalescent plasma) has shown beneficial effects in outbreaks of SARS and influenza virus infections (
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Al-Tawfiq et al., 2017</xref>). Studies in these infections indicated that the use of CP can reduce viral loads and mortality (

 <xref rid="ref162" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Due to the lack of clinical data demonstrating efficacy in MERS-CoV infection, the use of CP is considered an investigational treatment by the WHO (
 <xref rid="ref158" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2014</xref>). Only two cases have been reported to use intravenous immunoglobulin as part of an integral treatment intervention; therefore, a beneficial effect was not readily quantifiable (

 <xref rid="ref169" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). A protocol to determine the safety and effectiveness of CP therapy for patients infected with MERS-CoV was recently published (
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Arabi et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, the authors concluded that due to the variation in the levels of MERS-CoV-specific immunoglobulins in recovered patients, a large screening will be necessary to obtain sufficient plasma donors. A clinical study was registered based on these findings, but since then, it has been withdrawn (NCT02190799). The use of CP remains as a potential therapeutic intervention but the lack of evidence to prove its safety and efficacy in treating infected patients limits its potential impact (
