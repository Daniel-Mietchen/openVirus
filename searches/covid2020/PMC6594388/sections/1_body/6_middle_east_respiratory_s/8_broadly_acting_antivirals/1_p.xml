<p>One of the main strategies implemented in the clinics for the treatment of MERS-CoV is the use of broadly acting antivirals although supportive therapy continues to be the primary approach for treatment (
 <xref rid="ref100" ref-type="bibr">Modjarrad, 2016</xref>). Antivirals such as interferon and ribavirin that show strong inhibition of MERS-CoV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> have been used in the clinics with different degrees of success. Ribavirin is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside that interferes with the synthesis of viral mRNA. The best effect has been observed using a combination therapy of interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (
 <xref rid="ref101" ref-type="bibr">Momattin et al., 2013</xref>). Different type I interferons including IFN-α2b and IFN-β1b have been used in the management of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection (
 <xref rid="ref97" ref-type="bibr">McIntosh, 2017</xref>). In a study using macaques, animals were treated with IFN-α2b and ribavirin staring at 8 h after infection with MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Falzarano et al., 2013</xref>). The infected animals were euthanized at 72 h post-infection which is the peak of disease in this model. The group that received the combination treatment did not developed overt clinical signs of infection, had reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduction in lung virus titers, and reduction in overall lung pathology compared to the group of macaques that did not receive treatment. Most of the data on the efficacy of this combination therapy are from retrospectives studies (

 <xref rid="ref97" ref-type="bibr">McIntosh, 2017</xref>). In a study comparing infected patients that received this combination therapy in addition to support therapy, it was observed that these patients had a significantly better survival at day 14 post-laboratory confirmation of the infection (70%) compared to the patients that only received the supportive therapy (29%) (
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">Omrani and Shalhoub, 2015</xref>). In a case study report of a health worker infected with MERS-CoV, the use of IFN-α2b plus ribavirin was associated with his recovery as well as with a beneficial prophylactic effect in his spouse who only developed a mild respiratory illness (
 <xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">Khalid et al., 2015</xref>). IFN-β has also been used in combination therapies for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection (
 <xref rid="ref128" ref-type="bibr">Shalhoub et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Arabi et al., 2018</xref>). In a retrospective study that analyzed a small cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed infection, it was observed that treatment with the combination of IFN-β1a and ribavirin did not significantly improve survival (
 <xref rid="ref128" ref-type="bibr">Shalhoub et al., 2015</xref>). In a different retrospective study, analysis of the data demonstrated that administration of IFN-β improved survival in treated patients. However, after a multivariate analysis, the positive effect was not significant (
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Al Ghamdi et al., 2016</xref>). Results vary between different retrospective studies and this is in part due to the presence of comorbidities and most importantly the time for treatment initiation (
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2017</xref>), since it has been observed that the window of opportunity is very narrow and only effective when started within the first 48 h of confirmed diagnosis (
 <xref rid="ref101" ref-type="bibr">Momattin et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref157" ref-type="bibr">Widagdo et al., 2017</xref>). A case study of a MERS-CoV-infected patient who received ribavirin in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra®), a human immunodeficiency virus antiviral, and IFN-α2a, reported that this regimen was effective to treat the patient (
 <xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). The patient, a 64-year-old male with different comorbidities, started treatment on day 4 post admission and achieved viral clearance just 6 days after initiation of treatment and finally was discharged from the hospital on day 13 after admission (
 <xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). In a recent study, a combination of ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir was used as a post-exposure prophylaxis in health care workers who had been exposed to MERS-CoV-infected patients and demonstrated a reduction of 40% in the risk of infection (
 <xref rid="ref112" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2019</xref>). A preclinical study in common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV showed that treatment with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-β1b improved the clinical and pathological outcomes of the infected animals (
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2015</xref>). A phase 2/3 clinical trial NCT02845843 to determine the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-β1b for the treatment of MERS-CoV-infected patients was initiated in 2016. The clinical trial was expected to be concluded in July of 2018; however, no results or activity have been reported.
