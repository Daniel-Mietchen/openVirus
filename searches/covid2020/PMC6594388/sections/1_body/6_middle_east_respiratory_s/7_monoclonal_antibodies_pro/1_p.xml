<p>Using their VelocImmune mice, Regeneron produced fully human mAbs binding the spike protein of MERS-CoV. Two lead mAb candidates (REGN 3051 and REGN 3048) were further characterized 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref113" ref-type="bibr">Pascal et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>, both mAbs potently neutralized the MERS-CoV while 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in a mouse model of infection demonstrated that treatment of infected mice caused a reduction in lung virus titers and histopathology (

A phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of single ascending doses of a combination of both mAbs administered IV in healthy adult volunteers is currently underway (NCT03301090).
