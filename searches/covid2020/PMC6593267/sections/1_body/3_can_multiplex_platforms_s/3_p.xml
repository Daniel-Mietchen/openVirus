<p>Antibiotics that are effective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against atypical bacteria are generally recommended and largely used when these pathogens are the suspected or demonstrated cause of an RTI (Esposito et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>; Kohlhoff and Hammerschlag, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, the actual relevance of these drugs in clinical practice is debated, and there is evidence that seems to suggest that they are only slightly effective or not effective (Spuesens et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gardiner et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In children, only macrolides can be used against 
 <italic>Mp</italic> and 
 <italic>Cp</italic>, as other drugs that are effective against atypical bacteria cannot be prescribed to these patients, particularly the youngest. The administration of tetracyclines and chloramphenicol can lead to severe adverse events; ketolides and streptogramins have limited use in pediatrics; and fluoroquinolones are not licensed for use in subjects &lt;18 years of age (Principi and Esposito, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). However, many studies that have compared the clinical course of 
 <italic>Mp</italic> and 
 <italic>Cp</italic> infections in children treated with macrolides or other drugs that are ineffective against these pathogens have reported no difference between the two groups, suggesting that macrolides are useless (Principi and Esposito, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). In addition, macrolides should be used only when their use is presumed to be effective in reducing the abuse of antibiotics and the emergence of resistant strains (Principi and Esposito, 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).
