<p>Multiplex platforms based on molecular methods can be used only in the hospital, as they require specific equipment and laboratory technicians with considerable knowledge, training, and experience (Beckmann and Hirsch, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Esposito et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>; Biomerieux, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Fast Track Diagnostic, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Moreover, these platforms have a turnaround time that is significantly shorter than that of culture but generally much longer than that of rapid tests as they take some hours to give reliable results. This can be a limitation in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, where many patients require immediate diagnostic and therapeutic decisions (Beckmann and Hirsch, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Esposito et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>; Biomerieux, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Fast Track Diagnostic, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Only the most recently developed platforms, such as the BioFire® FilmArray® Respiratory Panel 2, have an acceptable turnaround time of about 1 h, not much longer than a rapid test (Biofire, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Finally, the number of samples that can be processed per run can significantly vary from assay to assay. In some cases, such in the case of the already cited BioFire® assay, only one sample could be processed per run, while most platforms have higher sample throughput (up to 96 samples) (Chan et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This can be a problem during epidemics when several patients have to be tested simultaneously.
