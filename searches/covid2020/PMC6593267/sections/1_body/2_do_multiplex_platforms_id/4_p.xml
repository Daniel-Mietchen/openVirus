<p>Long-term viral shedding after a previous infection can further render the results of multiplex platforms poorly effective in identifying the etiology of a disease. However, there are significant differences in long-term shedding among the various infectious agents. Generally, those agents that are uncommonly carried are the same agents that are shed only for a few days, and the opposite trend applies for those agents that are frequently asymptomatically carried. Although certain influenza patients can shed the virus up to 8 days, shedding typically peaks on day 1 after the onset of symptoms (Ip et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Although there are exceptions (Munywoki et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), RSV shedding has been estimated to last between 3.4 and 7.4 days (Hall et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Okiro et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In contrast, RV and BC are generally shed for a longer time. In a study involving 46 children aged 6–36 months with bocavirus infection, it was shown that in 22% of cases, the virus persisted in the respiratory secretions for more than 30 days, despite the rapid disappearance of clinical manifestations (Wagner et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The same prolonged shedding has been reported for RV (Loeffelholz et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), although there are differences according to the type of the infecting strain (Daleno et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Long-lasting persistence in the respiratory secretions after acute infection has been demonstrated for ADV (Kalu et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and atypical bacteria. The persistence of 
 <italic>Mp</italic> DNA in the throat is common, with a median carriage time of 7 weeks after the disease onset (range 2 days−7 months) (Nilsson et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). 
 <italic>Cp</italic> can be detected for months, as this pathogen temporarily interrupts its replication cycle when exposed to antimicrobials but later resumes replication, leading to the generation of infectious particles (Panzetta et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
