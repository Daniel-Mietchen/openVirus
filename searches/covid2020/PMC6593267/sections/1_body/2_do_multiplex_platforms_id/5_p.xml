<p>Finally, viruses can be detected during the incubation period without playing any role in the determination of the actual disease. The incubation period for viral respiratory infections is generally short. It has been calculated (Lessler et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) that this period lasts 5.6 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8–6.3) for ADV, 3.2 days (95% CI, 2.8–3.7) for human coronavirus, 1.4 days (95% CI, 1.3–1.5) for IV A, 0.6 days (95% CI, 0.5–0.6) for IV B, 2.6 days (95% CI, 2.1–3.1) for PIV, 4.4 days (95% CI, 3.9–4.9) for RSV, and 1.9 days (95% CI, 1.4–2.4) for RV. However, during this period, these viruses are detectable in the respiratory secretions and can lead to diagnostic mistakes.
