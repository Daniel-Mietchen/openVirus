<p>When temporary recommendations from WHO for screening measures have been issued in response to a public health event, then countries should have the capacities to implement such measures. Other factors of consideration are: the disease severity, the transmissibility (and whether the transmission takes place before or after symptom onset), the mode of transmission, the incubation period, the symptomatology of disease, and how easily the disease can be detected, the proportion of febrile patients, the temporal and spatial extent and the phase of the outbreak, any available results from modeling studies, the type of country, and point of entry, the disease epidemiology in the country, the volume of travelers and connections to affected areas (

All these factors should be considered to estimate the possible expected detection rates, and to balance this with other measures that could be implemented, and the cost and effectiveness of those. A mathematical model presented by Gostic, K.M., and colleagues, demonstrated how different factors of six disease and outbreak characteristics and human behavior can affect screening measures’ effectiveness. It showed that “for pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage. However, even in the most optimistic scenario arrival screening will miss the majority of cases” [
