<p>Very limited information is available about the cost and cost-effectiveness of screening measures. General entry screening measures at airports of Australia for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Canada for SARS, and Taiwan for Dengue fever cost about US$50,000 per case detected (airport clinic staffing cost), a total of 7.55 million Can$ investment for a period of four months, and US$ 43,000 for each set of instruments used at screening, respectively [
