<p>The research strategy of this bibliographic review did not reveal statistical data specifically for entry screening at ground crossings. Crossing land borders for sick, symptomatic persons may be easier than moving through air or sea means of transport. The density of populations crossing land borders can be very intense or not at all from place to place. The EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014/2015 spread between the affected countries in West Africa through land borders [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This fact should be considered by policy makers for preparedness planning. Countries where many official and unofficial crossing points exist or countries where border checks are not routinely conducted at ground crossings may not be well prepared to respond. Preparedness activities for potential unexpected events should include plans for implementation of screening measures at ground crossings. Screening measures at land borders require cooperation among neighboring countries and regions. However, considering the previously reported challenges and the lack of evidence on the impact of entry screening measures at ground crossings, this area may represent a gap in preparedness in the event of a high risk of exportation/introduction and spread of disease through land borders of neighboring countries.
