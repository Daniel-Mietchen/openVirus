<p>Several attempts were made by researchers to evaluate the public health impact of entry screening measures by comparing numbers of cases identified through screenings at airports with the total number of imported cases, or with cases locally acquired in the country in the same timeframe. However, the onset of symptoms was not assessed in all cases and it is not clear if the imported cases passed through screening were symptomatic or incubating. Entry screening at airports implemented on routine basis proved to be successful in Taiwan (an island) in identifying about half of the imported cases of Dengue fever [

Another study in Japan showed that only 11 confirmed cases of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were detected through entry screening, but 633 cases were diagnosed among the Japanese population and about 20% of them had passed through the entry screening [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The detection rate of Dengue fever and Chikungunya infection was higher than that of influenza. This can be attributed to the difference in the severity of symptoms and whether it can be observable or measurable when passing the entry points at airports, as well as the rate of persons who will ask for medical care in the health care system and will be captured by the routine surveillance system. Moreover, this can be attribute to the fact that entry screening for vector-borne diseases in Taiwan has been implemented on a routine basis for long periods of time and not as part of response measures to emergencies that are implemented in short periods of time.
