<p>This bibliographic review showed that most of the entry primary fever screening for SARS, Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and vector-borne diseases was conducted using thermal scanner cameras, followed when necessary by secondary screening using NCITs or contact thermometers. An ECDC technical report reviewed evidence about the accuracy of body temperature measuring devices and concluded that there are a variety of technologies available commercially; some NCITs are approved for use as diagnostic tools as happens with the contact thermometers, but thermal scanner cameras have not been evaluated for such purpose [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The report continues that NCITs are more accurate than the thermal scanner cameras. The US CDC evaluated the performance of NCITs, showing a sensitivity of 80–99% and a specificity of 75–99%. Equipment calibration and accuracy checks according to manufacturers’ instructions, and training of staff in the correct use are essential during screening measure implementation.
