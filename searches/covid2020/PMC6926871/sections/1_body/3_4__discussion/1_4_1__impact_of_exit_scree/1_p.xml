<p>Evidence from this review about prevention of international transmission of disease by detecting and prohibiting travel to exposed or ill travelers from affected countries is mainly based on the measures implemented in response to EVD in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, and Mali [

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In total, about 300,000 were screened in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, but no case was detected through exit screening measures. During the study reporting period, four confirmed cases were exported through air travel during the exit screening measure implementation, but were not symptomatic while traveling [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. EVD is a disease with high pathogenicity and a very low number of asymptomatic cases [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Consequently, it is probably unlikely that additional cases would have been exported through air or sea travel without being detected by surveillance systems in the destination non-affected countries.
