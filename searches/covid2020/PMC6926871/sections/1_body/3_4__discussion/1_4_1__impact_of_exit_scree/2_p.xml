<p>An assessment of the impact of exit screening measures at ground crossings is much more challenging than at airports and seaports. The 2014/2015 Ebola outbreak spread through the population movement in the land borders of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and was later introduced to Senegal and Mali [

Exit screening at ground crossings combined visual checks for symptomatic persons at official ground crossings, health education, and community engagement, as well as implementation of plans for isolation, communication, assessment, referral, and transportation. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published evidence meeting the inclusion/search criteria about the positive impact of screening measures at ground crossings in preventing the exportation of EVD cases from affected countries.
