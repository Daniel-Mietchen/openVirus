<p>The scoping search identified several studies reporting results of modeling that can inform decision-makers about the potential effects of entry screening measure implementation. A study modeled the number of expected Ebola infected travelers exiting affected countries, the potential effect of air travel restrictions, and the efficiency of airport-based traveler screening at international points of entry and exit [

The study concluded that exit screening measures at three airports in the affected countries would be successful in assessing all potentially exposed or Ebola-affected travelers. Another study created a model to assess the effectiveness of entry screening for the 2009 Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) in the US and concluded that it will not significantly delay arrival of influenza cases by air travel, but will reduce the rate of new US cases and subsequent deaths [
