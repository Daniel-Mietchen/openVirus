<p>Screening measures to migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers were not under the scope of this review. In case of forced migration travelers often cross borders through unofficial points (land crossings or arriving by boats at coastlines) and not the official points of entry where authorities and structures exists. In this case, the authorities that are involved in screening and the procedures are different from what is applied at the official points of entry for regular travelers. Moreover, if migrants arrive in a country at the official points of entry, each country implements its own policy in terms of targeted diseases and examinations. This review did not analyze data from screening measures to migrants. </p>
