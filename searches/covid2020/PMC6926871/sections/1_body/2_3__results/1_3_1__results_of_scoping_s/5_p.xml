<p>Screening measures as reported in the published literature were decided to be applied at the specific setting and situation, and generalizing conclusions was not considered to be appropriate [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Disease virulence, type, and severity of symptoms, length of incubation period, proportion of asymptomatic carriers, transmissibility, period of communicability, and mode of transmission were factors that determined the degree of success of screening measures depending on the disease, as well as the extent and evolution of the outbreak and the phase that measures were applied [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Finally, the country characteristics seemed to play a role such as whether the country was an island country or shared borders or had direct connections of flights or ship itineraries with affected countries [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For the previously mentioned reasons, no general conclusions about the impact of entry or exit screening for all infectious diseases could be drawn, and appraisal of impact should be done considering each specific disease and the context of screening measure implementation.
