<p>The screening methods protocol design and the robustness of application can influence the effectiveness of screening measures [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The exposure and symptom assessment methods, the tools and type of equipment used, and the number of staff involved and their training play an important role in the outcome of screening measures [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Screening protocols for symptoms and exposure assessment included questionnaires, health alert leaflets, visual checks, and body temperature measurements. Each method has its strengths and limitations [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the reviewed evidence, self-reporting of exposure and symptoms in questionnaires relies on the honesty of the responder, language barriers exist, and fever symptoms can be concealed by antipyretic drug use [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Screening cannot detect incubating or asymptomatic travelers [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Fever and other symptoms are non-specific and planning and resources are needed for possible high demand of laboratory tests [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. During the EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014/2015, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04638-f004">Figure 4</xref>) some travelers attempted to escape entry screening by presenting passports which did not show that they had traveled to an affected country [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In general, the prevalence of disease targeted by screening is very low among travelers, and the positive predictive values and the sensitivity of screening measures are expected to be very low for the diseases targeted through screening [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This is expected especially when general massive (to all travelers) rather than targeted screening measures (e.g., to travelers coming from affected countries or certain direct flights) are applied.
