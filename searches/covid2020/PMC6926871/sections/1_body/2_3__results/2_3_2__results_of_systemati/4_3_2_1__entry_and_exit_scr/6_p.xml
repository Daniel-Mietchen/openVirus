 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As reported by Cohen et al., in the land borders of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, simple exit screening measures involving visual screening for illness at designated official border crossings were applied for EVD [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Due to sparse, understaffed, and under-resourced official border points of entry, land borders were characterized as “porous” and it was not possible to apply measures similar to airports. Two articles refer to entry screening measures implemented at the Eurostar terminal/train station at London St Pancras for EVD [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-04638" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Measures included visual and fever screening.
