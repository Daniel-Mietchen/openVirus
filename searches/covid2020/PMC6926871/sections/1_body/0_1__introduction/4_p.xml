With the primary screening, an initial assessment is carried out by personnel, who may not necessarily have public health or medical training. Activities include visual observation of travelers for signs of the infectious disease, measurement of travelersâ€™ body temperature, and completion of a questionnaire by travelers asking for presence of symptoms and/or exposure to the infectious agent. Travelers who have signs or symptoms of the infectious disease, or have been potentially exposed to the infectious agent, are referred to secondary screening. Secondary screening should be carried out by personnel with public health or medical training. It includes an in-depth interview, a focused medical and laboratory examination and second temperature measurement [

Specific objectives of entry or exit screening measures can include: identification of ill travelers who may have signs and symptoms, and of travelers who may have been exposed to a hazard and their close contacts; identification of appropriate public health measures, such as treatment, isolation, quarantine and travel restrictions that are commensurate with the risks and do not unduly interfere with international travel; proper collection of information and reporting of public health risks; provision of information and education to the traveling public about health risks.
