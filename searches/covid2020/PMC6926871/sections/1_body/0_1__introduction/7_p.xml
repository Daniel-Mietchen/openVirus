<p>This paper describes the results of a scoping search and of a systematic bibliographic review aiming at giving insight on entry and exit screening referring to travelers at points of entry worldwide, with an emphasis among EU/European Economic Area (EEA) Member States (MS). Evidence from this study was used to inform EU MS in the framework of a training course conducted in 2019 about entry/exit screening structures and processes currently in place in EU MS and worldwide, as well as the strengths, limitations and lessons learnt from applying entry/exit screening at points of entry. Decision-making issues on implementing health measures that are commensurate with the risk, avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade, and considering business continuity plans are also discussed. Finally, the review explores preparedness issues and the capacities that must be in place at points of entry to implement entry/exit screening for infectious diseases. </p>
