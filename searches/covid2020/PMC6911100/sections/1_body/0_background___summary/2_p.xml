<p id="Par5">To help prevent future incidence of MERS-CoV, public health officials can focus on mitigating zoonotic transfer; however, in order to do this effectively, additional research is needed to determine where spillover could occur between mammals and humans. Previous literature reviews have looked at healthcare-associated outbreaks

 </sup>. This database seeks fill gaps in literature and build upon existing notification data by enhancing the geographic resolution of MERS-CoV data and providing occurrences of both mammal and environmental detections in addition to human cases. This information can help inform epidemiological models and targeted disease surveillance, both of which play important roles in strengthening global health security. Knowledge of the geographic extent of disease transmission allows stakeholders to develop appropriate emergency response and preparedness activities (

Additionally, targeted disease surveillance will provide healthcare workers with updated lists of at-risk countries. Patients with a history of travel to affected regions could then be rapidly isolated and treated, thus reducing risk of nosocomial transmission.
