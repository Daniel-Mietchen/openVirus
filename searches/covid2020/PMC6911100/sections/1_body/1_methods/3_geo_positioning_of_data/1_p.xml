 </sup> was used to manually extract location information at the highest resolution available from individual articles. We evaluated spatial information as either points or polygons. The geography was defined as a point if the location of transmission was reported to have occurred within a 5 × 5 km area. Point data are represented by a specific latitude and longitude. A point references an area smaller than 5 × 5 km in order to be compatible with the typical 5 × 5 km resolution of satellite imagery used for global analyses.
