<p id="Par13">We used three different types of polygons: known administrative boundaries, buffers, and custom polygons. Relevant administrative units were sourced from the Global Administrative Unit Layers curated by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup> for known administrative boundaries of governorates, districts, or regions, and paired with the occurrence record. Buffers were created to encompass areas in cities and regions without corresponding administrative units. To ensure that buffers encompassed the entirety of the area of interest, Google Maps was used to determine the required radius. In areas with unspecified boundaries (e.g. Table Mountain National Park and the border region between Saudi Arabia and UAE) ArcGIS was used to generate custom polygons, which were assigned a unique code within a defined shapefile for ease of re-identification.
