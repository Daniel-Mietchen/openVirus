<p id="Par8">We identified published reports of MERS-CoV by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus with the following terms: “Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome”, “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome”, “MERSCoV”, and “MERS”. The initial search was for all articles published about MERS-CoV prior to April 30, 2017, and was subsequently updated to February 22, 2018. These searches were conducted through the University of Washington Libraries’ institutional database subscriptions. We searched the Web of Science Web of Science Core Collection (the subscribed edition includes Science Citation Index Expanded, 1900-present; Social Sciences Citation Index, 1975-present; Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index, 1975-present; Emerging Sources Citation Index, 2015-present). We searched the standard Scopus database and the standard, freely available PubMed database; these products have a single version that is consistent across institutional subscriptions or access points.</p>
