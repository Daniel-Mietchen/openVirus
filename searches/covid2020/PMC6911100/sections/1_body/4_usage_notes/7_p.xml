<p id="Par82">A major limitation of this database is the potential for sampling bias, which stems from higher frequency of disease reporting within countries where there exists strong healthcare infrastructure and reporting systems. This database does not attempt to account for such biases, which must be addressed in subsequent modelling activities where such biases are of consequence. Similarly, another limitation is potential duplicate documentation of singular occurrences. This can happen when the same occurrence is assigned different geographies (e.g. point, polygon) in multiple publications. Even though extractors made efforts to prospectively manually identify duplicate occurrences, this was challenging because the process relied upon papers providing sufficient details for extractors to determine a duplicate occurrence (e.g. geography, patient demographics, dates of occurrence, diagnostic methods, etc.). However, the majority of papers did not report such details for each occurrence. In those instances, it was impossible for extractors to discern whether occurrences may have been duplicates from a previous artic le. Even case studies inconsistently reported patient details and demographic information. These are some examples of challenges faced by extractors when we attempted to identify duplicates. Without sufficient contextual clues, extractors lacked evidence to determine duplicity and thus likely extracted some unique occurrences more than once. Despite efforts to remove duplicate occurrences from the database, it is possible that some remain.</p>
