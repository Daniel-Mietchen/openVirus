<p id="Par80">The addition of sampling techniques and prevalence data may improve this dataset. Researchers were ultimately unable to add these data due to inconsistencies in the way literature reported sampling techniques and prevalence date by geography. An attempt to extract these data using the current approach would have led to sporadic inclusion of this information and would not have been comprehensive for the entire dataset. Moving forward, we recommend authors report sampling technique and prevalence data at the highest resolution geography possible, as seen in Miguel
