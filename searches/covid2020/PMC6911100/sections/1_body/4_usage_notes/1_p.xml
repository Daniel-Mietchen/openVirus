 </sup> and leishmaniasis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Our ability to capture occurrences in this dataset is contingent on the data contained within published literature. Therefore, this dataset does not represent a total count of all cases. Instead, this datasetâ€™s value lies within its geo-precision. Data were extracted with a focus on obtaining the highest resolution possible. These data may be merged with other datasets, such as WHO
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup> or OIE
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup> surveillance records, and are intended to complement, not replace, these resources. Together, published reports and notification data can provide a more comprehensive snapshot of current disease extent and at-risk locations.
