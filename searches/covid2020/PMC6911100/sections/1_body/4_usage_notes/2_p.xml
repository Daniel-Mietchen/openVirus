<p id="Par77">An important consideration, whether using the literature data alone, or in combination with other databases, is the potential for duplication. Various pieces of metadata can be used to evaluate where potential duplicates could lie, such as common date fields (month_start, month_end, year_start, year_end) or consistent geographic details (lat, long, poly_id, shape_type) or shared epidemiological tags (patient_type). Researchers may wish to consider further steps, such as fuzzy matching of geographic data (e.g. matching a point with an overlapping buffer) or temporal data (e.g. matching a precise month with an overlapping month interval). We acknowledge this duplicate-removal process will not catch all matching records, but it will likely catch several. We recommend this approach because it will allow researchers to remove several duplicates without erroneously deleting any two occurrences that are truly unique (i.e. not duplicates). Essentially, we recommend a sensitive approach above a more specific approach, as the latter simply risks culling too many records that arenâ€™t actually duplicates.</p>
