<p id="Par83">Geographic uncertainty is similarly problematic for analyses such as this. In some cases, polygons, as opposed to points, are utilised as a geographic frame of reference, reflecting the uncertainty in geotagging in the articles themselves. For some occurrences, there is a strong assumption that the geography listed corresponds to the site of infection. While the use of 5 km × 5 km as the minimum geographical unit allows for some leeway in this precision, it is possible that even with the point data (often corresponding to household clusters) these may not map directly with true infection sites. This must be considered in any subsequent geospatial analysis.</p>
