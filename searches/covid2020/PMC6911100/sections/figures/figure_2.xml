 <caption>
  <p>Geographic distribution of published detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Occurrences are layered from top to bottom in the following order: Index (green), Unspecified (orange), Mammal (yellow), Import (blue), Secondary (purple). Points were plotted using their assigned latitudes and longitudes, and shape files were created for polygons. Buffers were also plotted using assigned latitudes and longitudes, after which each bufferâ€™s custom radius was drawn. Higher resolution geographies (points, buffers, governorates) were plotted on top of lower resolution geographies (countries, regions).</p>
