 <caption> Geographic distribution of detections of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in mammals. Mammal populations testing positive for MERS-CoV primarily consisted of camels but also included a sheep, hamadryas baboon, Egyptian tomb bat, and an alpaca. Points were plotted using their assigned latitudes and longitudes, and shape files were created for polygons. Buffers were also plotted using assigned latitudes and longitudes, after which each bufferâ€™s custom radius was drawn. Higher resolution geographies (points, buffers, governorates) were plotted on top of lower resolution geographies (countries, regions). </caption>
