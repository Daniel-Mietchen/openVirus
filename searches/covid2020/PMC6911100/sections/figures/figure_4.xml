 <caption>
  <p>Geographic distribution of detections of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among cases tagged as Index or unspecified. Occurrences tagged as Index are coloured green, those tagged as unspecified are coloured orange. Points were plotted using their assigned latitudes and longitudes, and shape files were created for polygons. Buffers were also plotted using assigned latitudes and longitudes, after which each bufferâ€™s custom radius was drawn. Higher resolution geographies (points, buffers, governorates) were plotted on top of lower resolution geographies (countries, regions).</p>
