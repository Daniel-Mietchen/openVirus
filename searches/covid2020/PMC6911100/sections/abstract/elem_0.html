      <p id="Par1">As a World Health Organization Research and Development Blueprint priority pathogen,
         there is a need to better understand the geographic distribution of Middle East Respiratory
         Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and its potential to infect mammals and humans. This
         database documents cases of MERS-CoV globally, with specific attention paid to zoonotic
         transmission. An initial literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science,
         and Scopus; after screening articles according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria,
         a total of 208 sources were selected for extraction and geo-positioning. Each MERS-CoV
         occurrence was assigned one of the following classifications based upon published
         contextual information: index, unspecified, secondary, mammal, environmental, or imported.
         In total, this database is comprised of 861 unique geo-positioned MERS-CoV occurrences.
         The purpose of this article is to share a collated MERS-CoV database and extraction
         protocol that can be utilized in future mapping efforts for both MERS-CoV and other
         infectious diseases. More broadly, it may also provide useful data for the development
         of targeted MERS-CoV surveillance, which would prove invaluable in preventing future
         zoonotic spillover.
