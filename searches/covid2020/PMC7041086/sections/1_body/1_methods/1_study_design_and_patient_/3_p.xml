<p id="Par23">Several mPCR tests were used during the study period: the Respifinder® 19 (Pathofinder®, Maastricht, the Netherlands) from September 2009 to February 2012, Respifinder® 22 (Pathofinder®, Maastricht, the Netherlands) from March to June 2012, and Filmarray Respiratory Panel RP1.6 (Biofire, BioMérieux, Craponne, France) was used from June 2012 to September 2014. All these changes were made to decrease time to results. The various tests used have been reported to have similar performances [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], as confirmed by our internal method validations and the similar viral diversity observed over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Their reliability was also assessed throughout the study period by regular QCMD controls (Glasgow, UK).
