   <p id="Par26">Patients presenting a viral respiratory infection: viral infection group (VIG), i.e.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par27">Patients with at least one positive virological respiratory sampling, symptomatic or not. Nasopharyngeal swabs that tested positive only for rhinovirus were not considered to be positive for a significant virus, and were ignored.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par28">Patients presenting a bacterial respiratory infection with or without any respiratory virus: bacterial infection group (BIG), i.e. (i) patients with a positive bacteriological sample treated with antibiotics, with or without a positive virological sample during the study period (ii) patients with no bacteriological positive sample but treated with antibiotic therapy before the taking of the samples.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par29">Patients without any respiratory infection: Control group (CG), i.e. patients with no virological or bacteriological positive respiratory samples during the study, or those with nasopharyngeal swabs positive for rhinovirus only; or with a positive bacteriological respiratory sample not followed by antibiotic treatment (i.e. considered as a simple bacterial carriage).</p>
