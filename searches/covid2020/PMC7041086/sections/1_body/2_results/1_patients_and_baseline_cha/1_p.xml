<p id="Par39">Between September 2009 and September 2014, 154 patients received lung transplants at Bichat Hospital. Fifty-five patients were excluded from the analysis: 47 (31%) because of death within 6 months following transplantation, six (4%) due to a lack of spirometry assessment at inclusion or 6 months afterwards, and two because of pathological, proven herpetic pneumonia. Among the 99 remaining LTRs, 57 (57%) had at least one positive virological respiratory sample. Thus, patients were divided into three groups according to the criteria described above: 38 (38%) in the VIG, 25 (25%) in the BIG (6 patients mono-infected by bacteria and 19 co-infected patients) and 36 (36%) in the CG. The corresponding flow chart is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Nineteen 4 % of the respiratory samples were broncho-alveolar lavages or bronchial aspirations. General characteristics, type of immunosuppression and prior viral infections were similar across the three groups with the exception of renal dysfunction (eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m
 <sup>3</sup>), more prevalent in the VIG (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Previous AR requiring treatment in the 3 months prior to inclusion occurred for 9 (24%) patients in the VIG, 3 (12%) in the BIG, and none of the CG (
