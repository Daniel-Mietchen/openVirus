<p id="Par40">Patients were included at a median time of 303 (IQR, 213–560) days after transplantation. Both infected groups displayed similar respiratory symptoms. Likewise, the biological presentations of both infected groups were close, and inflammatory surrogates (leucocytes, C-reactive protein, platelets) did not differ statistically. BIG patients were more prone to be hospitalized (64 vs. 34%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04), and to present a more severe decrease of FEV-1 at inclusion (− 260 mL (− 410–0) vs. -50 mL (− 170–60)), compared to the VIG. Among patients examined with a thoracic tomodensitometry, seven patients (11%) presented a new infiltrate.
