<p id="Par43">Thirteen patients had a prior BOS at inclusion: 1 (2.8%) in the CG, 9 (23.7%) in the VIG and 3 (12.0%) in the BIG. There was a trend toward more viral respiratory investigation among patients with a BOS at inclusion (median of 14.0 (9.0–21.0) samples/patients) than for patients without BOS at inclusion (8.0 (4.0–15.0),
