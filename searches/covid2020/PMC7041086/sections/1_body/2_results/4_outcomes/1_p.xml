<p id="Par42">The overall rate of worsening 6-month-BOS was 13% with no significant differences between the three groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Sixteen patients (16%) died during the study period (6 BOS, 2 strokes, 2 neoplasia, 2 severe infections, 4 from unknown cause), with no significant differences between the three groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). After 6 months of observation, the FEV-1 delta was significantly different between the three groups, from a negative delta at -35 mL (IQR: − 340; + 80) in the VIG, to a median increase of + 10 mL (− 85; + 160) in the CG, and + 140 mL (+ 60; + 330) in the BIG (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). AR occurred earlier in the BIG, at a median of 6.5 (2.3–32.5) days, than in the VIG at 79.5 (5.0–111.2) days (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.07). In multivariate analyses adjusted for time between transplant and inclusion, age and sex, the association between AR and VIG remained significant although with a wide confidence interval (aOR = 5.5 [1.3–24.0], 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). (Table
