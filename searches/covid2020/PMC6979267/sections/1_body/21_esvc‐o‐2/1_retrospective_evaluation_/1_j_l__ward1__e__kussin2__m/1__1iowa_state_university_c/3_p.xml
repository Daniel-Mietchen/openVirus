<p>Average age of cats (9 +/− 4 years) did not differ between HOCM and HCM (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.12). Compared to cats with HCM, cats with HOCM were more likely to manifest CHF as pulmonary edema (44/47 versus 32/47; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003) and less likely to have pleural effusion (13/47 versus 25/47; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). Other than a higher incidence of heart murmurs in cats with HOCM (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), clinical variables did not differ between groups. Pimobendan was typically initiated on the date of CHF diagnosis (median time from diagnosis of CHF to initiation of pimobendan was 0 days). Initial dose of pimobendan was 0.25 +/− 0.07 mg/kg every 12 hours; dose (or frequency) was escalated at some point during CHF management in 31/94 (33%) of cases, with no difference between HOCM and HCM cats.
