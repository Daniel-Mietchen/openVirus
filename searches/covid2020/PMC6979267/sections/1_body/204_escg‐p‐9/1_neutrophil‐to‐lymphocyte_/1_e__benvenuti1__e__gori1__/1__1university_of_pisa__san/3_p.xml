<p>Forty‐one dogs presented to two veterinary facilities (Veterinary Teaching Hospital and Private Veterinary Center) with a final diagnosis of IRE were retrospectively included. The Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index (CCECAI) score was assessed for each dog at presentation. The diagnosis of IRE was set on histopathology performed on endoscopic biopsies and classified using the current WSAVA guidelines. Lacteal dilatation (LD) and crypts abscesses (CD) were also recorded. NLR was calculated for each dog. Serum total protein, albumin, cholesterol and C‐reactive protein (CRP) were also recorded. Kruskal‐Wallis test was performed to evaluate NLR between different CCECAI category (0‐3, 4‐5, 6‐8, 9‐11 and &gt; 12) and different histological grading. Spearman's correlation tests were performed between NLR and total protein, albumin, cholesterol and CRP. Mann‐Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>‐test was used to compare NLR in dogs with or without LD and CD. A receiving operator characteristic curve (ROC) was built to obtain an optimal cut‐off value of NLR to differentiate dogs with or without LD. A Fisher's exact test was then performed between the presence of LD and NLR groups.
