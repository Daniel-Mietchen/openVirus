<p>NLR was significantly different between CCECAI score categories (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004). NLR was negatively correlated with total protein (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.022, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.35), albumin (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.41) and cholesterol (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.33). No significant correlation between CRP and NLR was found. NLR was not different between histological grading and dogs with or without CD. Contrarily, NLR was higher in dogs with LD (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004). The cut‐off value of NLR for the detection of LD was 3.96 (sensitivity 82.4% and specificity 58.3%).
