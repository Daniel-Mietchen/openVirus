<p>So far, this is the first report evaluating the NLR in IRE dogs. Our results suggest that NLR could be an easy, feasible and economic additional tool to evaluate the disease severity in IRE dogs. Moreover, NLR seem to have a good correlation with other essential biochemistry parameters in the evaluation of dogs with protein‚Äêlosing enteropathy. Furthermore, the most interesting data was the association between NLR and histologic lymphangectasia.</p>
