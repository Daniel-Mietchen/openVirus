<p>Median DI was statistically different between HC and DM dogs (HD −5.3 vs DM ‐1,5; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0019;). A negative dysbiosis index (DI), indicative of normobiosis, was present in 82% of DM dogs. Four dogs in the DM were dysbiotic (DI index &gt;0). TLI, folate and cobalamin concentrations were normal in all dogs with DM, though two dogs had cobalamin levels &lt;350 ng/L. There was no significant difference between groups for total BAs and proportion of secondary BAs (respectively 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.1124 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.5814).
