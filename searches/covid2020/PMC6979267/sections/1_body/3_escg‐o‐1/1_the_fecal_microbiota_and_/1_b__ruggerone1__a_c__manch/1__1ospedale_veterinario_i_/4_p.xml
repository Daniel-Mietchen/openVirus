<p>The results of this preliminary study did not confirm the association between intestinal dysbiosis, fecal bile acids dysmetabolism and DM in dogs under insulin therapy. Fecal unconjugated BA profiles of DM dogs mimicked those seen in healthy dogs. Further studies are needed to evaluate the possible role of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of canine DM.</p>
