<p>To this aim, naturally‐passed fecal samples and left over serum samples obtained for diagnostic proposals from 17 adult dogs with DM were collected. Fecal samples from 16 clinically healthy dogs were used as a control population. In addition, serum folate, cobalamin and cTLI were assessed in the DM group to exclude the presence of other causes of dysbiosis; for each DM dog, the fed diet was known and the use of antibiotic within the previous 12 months was excluded. DNA was extracted from each fecal sample prior to quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. Data for 8 bacterial groups was compiled to calculate a microbiota dysbiosis index (DI). Concentrations and proportions of fecal unconjugated primary (cholic/chenodeoxycholic) and secondary (litho/deoxy/ursodeoxycholic) BAs were measured using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry platform. Unpaired
