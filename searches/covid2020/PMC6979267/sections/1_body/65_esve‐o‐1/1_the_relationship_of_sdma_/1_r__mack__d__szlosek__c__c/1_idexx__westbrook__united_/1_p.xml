<p>Iatrogenic hypothyroidism in cats is associated with reduced glomerular filtration rate, increased occurrence of azotemia, and shortened long term survival. Previous studies have supported this conclusion but were limited by small sample sizes. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) has been shown to be an earlier, more sensitive, and reliable renal biomarker of decreased glomerular filtration rate than creatinine, which has been found to be influenced by fluctuations in lean muscle mass. The purpose of this study was to utilize big data to characterize the relationship of SDMA and creatinine (Cr) to subnormal total T4 (TT4) post hyperthyroid treatment. Using the US IDEXX Reference Laboratories database 2, 395 cats were identified with samples that were tested with TT4, SDMA and Cr. From this dataset, a hyperthyroid treated group was identified, from this treated population a total of 479 subnormal TT4 cats were identified, defined as having a TT4 &lt; 0.8 μg/dL post hyperthyroid treatment. The remaining cats were euthyroid after treatment. A four‐to‐one comparative age‐matched control group of post treatment euthyroid cats to subnormal TT4 cats was used to evaluate SDMA and Cr pre‐and post‐treatment. A McNemar's paired test or Chi‐square test was used where appropriate. A significant increase in the number of subnormal TT4 cats with an SDMA concentration above the reference interval was found compared to euthyroid controls post‐treatment (39.6% (190/479) vs. 32.1% (616/1916),

Cr concentrations were also increased above the reference interval in a significantly greater number of subnormal TT4 cats as compared to controls post‐treatment (25.9% (124/479) vs. 12.8% (246/1916), P &lt; 0.001). In the subnormal TT4 group increased SDMA concentrations identified 13.7% more cats with potential decrease in GFR and reduction in renal function than Cr. This study confirms that a significant percentage of cats with subnormal TT4 attributed to overtreatment of hyperthyroidism have abnormal renal biomarkers as compared to those that are euthyroid following therapy. The big data used for this study supports the importance of avoiding iatrogenic hypothyroidism. The identified association of reduced renal function with iatrogenic hypothyroidism emphasizes the importance of avoiding overtreatment. Comprehensive renal monitoring including measurement of SDMA should be part of routine management of hyperthyroid cats.
