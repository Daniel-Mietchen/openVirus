<p>A total of 350 surveis were administrated, and 268 were returned (76.58% of adherence to the study). Twelve were discarded because incomplete.

Most of the pets presented to the department of internal medicine (43%), followed by oncology (14.8%) and emergency (10.9%); 95.7% of the sample declared to have anxiety, was concerned or demoralized for the health of their animals, and 69.7% of the subjects reported that would have appreciated to receive help from someone competent. In contrast, 30.3% declared “non‐desiring” support. The most reported motivation for their decision was the desire to live their emotions alone (50.6%). Sixty‐six % of the sample would use the service itself and/or suggest it to its family members in case of difficult decisions, poor prognosis, or emotional management particularly, those who claimed to normally feel anxiety and concern about the health of their animals (47.7%). They were among those who would most likely use the service (32%).
