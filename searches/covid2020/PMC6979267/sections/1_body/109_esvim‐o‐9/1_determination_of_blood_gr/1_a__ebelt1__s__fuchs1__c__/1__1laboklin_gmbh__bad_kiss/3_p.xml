<p>Among the 164 examined dogs, 62% were 
 <italic>DEA 1+</italic>, 100% 
 <italic>DEA 4+,</italic> 11% (card)/14% (gel) 
 <italic>DEA 5+</italic>, 97% 
 <italic>Kai 1+</italic> and 2% 
 <italic>Kai 2+</italic>. Blood from most 
 <italic>DEA 1+</italic> dogs bound strongly positive on the strips. Agglutination reactions for card and gel tests were concordant for 
 <italic>DEA 4+</italic> samples. In contrast, the reactions for 
 <italic>DEA 5</italic> were generally less in the agglutination test than in the gel column test with some discordant reactions. None of the dogs were 
 <italic>Kai 1+</italic>/
 <italic>2+</italic>, and only one was 
 <italic>Kai 1−/2‐</italic>. 
 <italic>Dal‐</italic> dogs were found in Cane Corso, Dalmatian, Doberman, Maltese, Mastiff, Shih Tzu, and Pug dogs. Various blood group patterns were observed in other breeds.
