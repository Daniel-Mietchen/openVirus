<p>Alimentary lymphoma is one of the most common forms of neoplasia in feline patients. Chemotherapy has been the main stay of therapy for decades for feline alimentary lymphoma. Overall response rates reported from 50‐92% and overall survival times range from days to &gt;3 years depending on the protocol utilized and the histologic form. For small cell lymphoma, treatment generally has involved the use of glucocorticoids in combination with chlorambucil (Leukeran). There is currently no standardized protocol for the use of these drugs with some clinicians choosing to continue the therapy for a defined period of time (6‐12 months) or indefinitely until disease progression in the patient. The aim of this study is to establish a foundation for use of low‐dose radiation therapy for feline intermediate and small cell alimentary lymphoma as an alternative to chronic chemotherapy or in patient's refractory to medical management.</p>
