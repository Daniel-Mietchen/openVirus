<p>Radiation therapy appears to be efficacious and well tolerated with no clinically relevant adverse effects reported. In addition to the favorable adverse event profile, low‐dose radiation was extremely convenient for the patients and clients as a number of these clients have to travel long distances for treatment, monitoring and follow‐up. Client compliance and satisfaction improved due to a variety of factors such as reduced number of at‐home medications, hospital visits and financial burden. Further investigation into the potential use of low‐dose radiation therapy for intermediate and small cell alimentary lymphoma as a salvage or an alternative to oral chemotherapy for feline patients is warranted.</p>
