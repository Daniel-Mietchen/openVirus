<p>Median (IQR) right and left CdTs in Group 1 were 0.30 (0.16) cm and 0.29 (0.10) cm, respectively; in Group 2 were 0.50 (0.17) cm and 0.51 (0.16) cm, respectively (p value &lt;0.0001 for both comparisons). Median (IQR) right and left CrTs in Group 1 were 0.32 (0.18) cm and 0.28 (0.10) cm, respectively; in Group 2 were 0.53 (0.12) cm and 0.49 (0.16) cm, respectively (p value &lt;0.0001 for both comparisons). Median right and left ALs in Group 1 were 1.40 (0.55) cm and 1.42 (0.76) cm, respectively; in Group 2 were 1.92 (0.75) cm and 2.08 (0.66) cm, respectively (p value &lt;0.0001 for both comparisons). From the analysis of ROC curves, global diagnostic accuracy separating Group 1 from Group 2 resulted 0.899 and 0.900 for the right and left CdT, respectively; 0.861 and 0.911 for the right and left CrT, respectively; 0.762 and 0.760 for the right and left AL, respectively.</p>
