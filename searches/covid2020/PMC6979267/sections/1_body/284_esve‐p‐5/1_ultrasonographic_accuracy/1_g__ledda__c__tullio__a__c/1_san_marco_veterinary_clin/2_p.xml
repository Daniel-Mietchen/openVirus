<p>Group 1 included 91 consecutive client‐owned dogs diagnosed with primary adrenal insufficiency on the base of signalment, history, clinicopathologic tests (CBCs, serum biochemistry, urinalyses) and ACTH stimulation test results (including basal plasma ACTH and serum aldosterone pre‐ and post‐ACTH determination). Group 2 included 91 dogs without primary adrenal insufficiency, individually matched with Group 1 dogs for breed, sex, sexual status and age (± 6 months). To reduce technological bias, Group 2 dogs selection took place in contiguous time periods with each Group 1 dog recruitment. Dogs that had received mitotane, trilostane or steroid medications and ace‐inhibitors before our clinical evaluation, were excluded from both groups.</p>
