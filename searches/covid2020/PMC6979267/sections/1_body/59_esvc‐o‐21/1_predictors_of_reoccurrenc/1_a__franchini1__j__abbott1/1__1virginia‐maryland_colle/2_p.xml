<p>Medical records of 5122 dogs enrolled in the LOOK‐Mitral registry from 1st November 2015 to 31st July 2018 were reviewed to identify dogs with stable ACVIM‐Stage C MMVD defined as dogs with CS and unchanged medical treatment for at least four weeks since the first identification of HF. The study population was composed by 186 dogs, subsequently divided into two groups: reoccurrence group (RG, n = 66) and no reoccurrence group (NRG, n = 120). Reoccurrence of CS was defined by resting respiratory rate &gt; 40 breath/minute and/or dyspnea, within the study period, that resolved after furosemide increase.</p>
