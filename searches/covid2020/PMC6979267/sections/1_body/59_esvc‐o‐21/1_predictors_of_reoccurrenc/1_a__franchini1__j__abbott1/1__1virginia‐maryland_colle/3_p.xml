<p>Baseline body weight (BW) (OR:1.11, 90%CI:1.06‐1.17), presence of cough (OR:1.98, 90%CI:1.05‐3.74), left atrial‐aortic ratio (LA/Ao)(OR: 3.08, 90%CI:1.38‐6.86), left ventricular internal diameter at end‐diastole (OR: 3.41, 90%CI:1.22‐9.50) and end‐systole (OR: 7.61, 90%CI:2.32‐24.90) indexed to body size, mitral valve peak E wave velocity (OR: 3.44, 90%CI:1.63‐7.27), and furosemide daily dosage (OR:1.32, 90%CI:1.04‐1.67) were associated with reoccurrence of CS in the univariate analysis. The BW (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0003) and LA/Ao (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0196) remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Increment of 0.1 of LA/Ao or of 1 kg in body weight were both associated with 1.1 increased odds of reoccurrence.
