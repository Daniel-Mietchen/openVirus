<p>Nine dogs with SNA and 8 healthy control dogs were in included in the retrospective arm of this study. Serum samples were obtained from these 17 dogs between 2017 and 2019 and stored at −80° C until analysis. Diagnosis of SNA was based on presence of compatible clinical signs and per‐endoscopic identification of fungal plaques with turbinate destruction and fungal culture. Treatment was deemed successful if there was resolution of clinical signs and absence of fungal plaques on follow‐up rhinoscopy. Serum 25(OH)D was measured using HPLC.</p>
