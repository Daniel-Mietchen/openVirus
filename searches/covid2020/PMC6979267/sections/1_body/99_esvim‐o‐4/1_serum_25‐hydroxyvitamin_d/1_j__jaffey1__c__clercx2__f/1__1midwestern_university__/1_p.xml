<p>Vitamin D has important roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Hypovitaminosis D in people has been associated with increased susceptibility and severity of illness with a variety of inhaled respiratory pathogens. Sinonasal aspergillosis (SNA) is a common cause of chronic nasal disease that remains a challenge to treat and is associated with substantial morbidity and non‚Äêsurvival in dogs. There is a lack of biomarkers that can predict the development of SNA and treatment outcome in dogs. Therefore, the 2 objectives of this study were 1) to compare serum 25(OH)D concentrations in dogs with SNA and healthy control dogs and 2) to determine if serum 25(OH)D concentrations can predict first time treatment outcome.</p>
