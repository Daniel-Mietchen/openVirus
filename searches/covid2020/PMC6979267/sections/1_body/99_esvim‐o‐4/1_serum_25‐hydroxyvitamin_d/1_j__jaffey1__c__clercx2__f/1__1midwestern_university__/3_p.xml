<p>Seventy‐eight percent of dogs with SNA had complete fungal debridement. Seven dogs had follow‐up available of which 57% (4/7) had first time treatment success. Dogs with SNA had significantly decreased serum 25(OH)D concentrations (mean, SD; 26.7 ng/ml, 15.3 ng/ml) compared to healthy control dogs (40.2 ng/ml, 7.4, p = 0.03), two‐tailed 
 <italic>t</italic>‐test). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations was not associated with first time treatment outcome (
