<p>P‐gp gene expression was not significantly different between ENT and the epithelial layer of the intestinal mucosa (quantitation cycle values expressed in Mean ± S.D): Organoid: PLE M = 24.5 ± 1.0; RW M = 24.7 ± 0.3; HC M = 25.7 ± 0.3; Tissue: PLE M = 25.4 ± 0.6; RW M = 26.3 ± 0.7; HC M = 24.1 ± 0.5; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.06), confirming that ENT express P‐pg in comparable amounts as reported 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tissues from the same dogs. The culture of primary canine ENT in Transwell showed apical expression of P‐gp, which is again consistent with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> observations. Co‐incubation with verapamil significantly reduced Rh123 fluorescence in the lumen of ENT at 30 min (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and 60 min (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), indicating that P‐gp‐mediated transport was successfully blocked.
