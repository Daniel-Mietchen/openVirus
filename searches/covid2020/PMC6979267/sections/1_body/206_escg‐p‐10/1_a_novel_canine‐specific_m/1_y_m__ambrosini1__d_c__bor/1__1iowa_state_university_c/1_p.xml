<p>P‐Glycoprotein (P‐gp) modulates oral absorption of therapeutic drugs in the small intestine. Many drugs serve as substrates for P ‐ gp including chemotherapeutic agents (vincristine, doxorubicin), parasiticides (macrocyclic lactones) and antidiarrheal agents (loperamide). Due to its significant influence on drug disposition and the risk of severe adverse drug reactions seen with defective P ‐ gp function, routine screening of drug candidates for P‐gp transport is common practice in human drug discovery. However, there is currently no canine‐specific 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> system for evaluating P‐gp‐mediated drug transport in veterinary medicine available. Our laboratory has recently developed an 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> 3D canine enteroid (ENT) system, which accurately mimics the cellular and molecular features of the intestinal epithelium in vivo. The aim of this research was to evaluate P‐gp functional activity and expression in canine ENT vs. intestinal tissues.
