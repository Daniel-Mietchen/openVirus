<p>P‐gp expression was assessed using qPCR of intestinal tissues and ENT from the ileum of 3 healthy and diseased dogs. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of canine ileal ENT in transwell culture was performed to assess the localization of P‐gp transporters. Functional assays were performed using 10 μM rhodamine123 (Rh123), a fluorescent dye substrate for P‐gp, with or without 20 μM verapamil (P‐gp inhibitor). An un‐paired 
 <italic>t</italic>‐tests was used to compare the mean luminal fluorescence intensity obtained with ImageJ. Kruskal‐Wallis test was used to compare the mean quantitation cycle obtained with qPCR, and 
 <italic>P = 0.05</italic> was considered as statistically significant.
