<p>Parvoviral DNA was detected using quantitative PCR (qPCR), then a minor groove binder real‐time PCR assay differentiated FPV, CPV2, CPV2a, CPV2b and CPV2c. Parvoviral DNA was detected in 25 (16.4%) faecal samples (SD1 0/47, SD2, 5/84, SD3 20/21). All positive samples from SD2 and SD3 were CPV2b, and FPV, respectively. Viral loads of CPV2b (1.85‐1.18 x 10
 <sup>5</sup>; median 4.62 x 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/μL template DNA) were lower than those of FPV (1.26 x 10
 <sup>3</sup>‐8.96 x 10
 <sup>9</sup>; median 9.7 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/μL template DNA). Quantitative PCR was more sensitive than cPCR to detect low‐level parvoviral shedding. FPV was shed by 95% asymptomatic shelter‐housed cats during an FPV outbreak. A low prevalence of CPV shedding was detected (3.3%). The potential role of cats as a reservoir of CPV infection in dogs varies between populations tested.
