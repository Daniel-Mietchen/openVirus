<p>Canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline parvovirus (FPV) cause severe, often fatal, enteritis in their hosts. A UK study reported faecal shedding of CPV, but not FPV, by 1 in 3 asymptomatic shelter cats. In contrast, an Australian study, utilizing a similar conventional PCR (cPCR) assay reported no CPV shedding and FPV shedding in 1.8% asymptomatic shelter cats.</p>
