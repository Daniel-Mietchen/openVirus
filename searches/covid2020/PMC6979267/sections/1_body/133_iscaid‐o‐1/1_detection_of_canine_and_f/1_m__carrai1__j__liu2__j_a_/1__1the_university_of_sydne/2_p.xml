<p>The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine whether low‐level parvoviral shedding, undetectable by cPCR, occurs in Australian shelter cats. Residual faecal samples from the previous Australian study (n = 152), collected from asymptomatic shelter cats on three sampling days (SD1 n = 47, SD2 n = 84, SD3 n = 21) over 12 months, were tested. SD3 occurred during an FPV outbreak.</p>
