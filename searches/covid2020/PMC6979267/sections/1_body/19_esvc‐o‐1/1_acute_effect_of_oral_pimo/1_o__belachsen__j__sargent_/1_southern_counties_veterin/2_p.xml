<p>Sixteen dogs in stage B2 MMVD were included in this prospective interventional study. Echocardiograms were performed at presentation and 3 hours following a single‐dose pimobendan. Two‐dimensional, M‐mode, and Doppler images were recorded from the right parasternal and left apical standard views. In all dogs, left atrial volume was measured using the biplane area‐length method at three time‐points: immediately before MV opening, at onset of P‐wave, and at MV closure. Reservoir, conduit and active pump functions were calculated, as previously described. In ten dogs, MV regurgitation volume was calculated by subtracting the forward stroke volume (Aortic outflow velocity time integral multiplied by the aortic cross‐sectional area) from the total left ventricular (LV) stroke volume (End‐systolic LV volume subtracted from the end‐diastolic LV volume, both measured using Simpson's method of discs). MV regurgitation fraction was calculated as the percentage of regurgitation volume from the total stroke volume. Paired Student 
 <italic>t‐</italic>test and Wilcoxon Signed‐Rank Test were used to compare the results.
