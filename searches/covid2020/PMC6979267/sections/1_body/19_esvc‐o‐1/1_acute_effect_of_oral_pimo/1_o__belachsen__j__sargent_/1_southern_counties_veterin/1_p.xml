<p>Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is associated with failure of the mitral valve (MV) apparatus. In a proportion of affected dogs, MV regurgitation is severe enough to cause an increase in left atrial (LA) volume and pressure. LA function was reported to decline with increased disease severity. Pimobendan, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor exerting positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects, was shown to decrease LA pressure, although its effect on LA function is not well established. This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the acute effect of pimobendan on LA function and mitral regurgitation fraction in dogs with stage B2â€‰MMVD.</p>
