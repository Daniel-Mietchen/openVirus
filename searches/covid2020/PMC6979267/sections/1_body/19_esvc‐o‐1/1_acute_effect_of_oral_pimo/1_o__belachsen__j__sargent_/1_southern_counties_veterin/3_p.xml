<p>Compared with baseline, LA volume was significantly lower on post‐pimobendan measurements immediately before MV opening (P &lt; 0.01), at P‐wave onset (P &lt; 0.01) and at MV closure (p = 0.02). However, LA conduit, reservoir and active pump functions did not change significantly. MV regurgitation fraction post‐pimobendan (27.7 +/− 5.3) was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01) compared with baseline (43.7 +/− 4.7), forward stroke volume was significantly increased (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.015), while total stroke volume did not change significantly.
