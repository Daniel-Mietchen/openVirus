<p>This study suggests that despite an acute reduction in LA volume, pimobendan may not exert a measurable effect on LA function. The beneficial decrease in left atrial volume appears to result from an acute reduction in MV regurgitation fraction. The mechanisms by which pimobendan reduces regurgitation fraction are thought to be associated with improved forward flow secondary to its inotropic and vasodilatory effects, in addition to reduced end‚Äêdiastolic LV dimension, minimising secondary functional mitral regurgitation.</p>
