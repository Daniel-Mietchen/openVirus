<p>Our data presents, as previous reported, an intestinal microbial dysbiosis in dogs with CE. As new finding, our results show an altered microbial metabolism in dogs with CE compared to healthy dogs, characterized by reduction of amino acid biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. Further studies including transcriptomic analysis are warranted to define the consequences of this microbiota dysfunction on dogs with CE.</p>
