<p>Fecal samples were collected from 14 healthy dogs and 20 dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE). Fecal DNA was extracted using a commercial kit (PowerSoil, QIAGEN). Functional characterization of the shotgun sequence reads in the KEGG database was performed using next generation sequencing, in order to identify the relative abundance of specific metabolic pathways. A Wilcoxon test was used for comparison of the gene abundance between groups. Significance was set at q &lt; 0.05.</p>
