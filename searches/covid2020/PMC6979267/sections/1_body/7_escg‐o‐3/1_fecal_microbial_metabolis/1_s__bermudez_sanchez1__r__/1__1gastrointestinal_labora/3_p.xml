<p>At phylum level, low abundance of Bacteroidetes was observed in dog with CE, compared to healthy control dogs (48.5 vs 1.6%; q = 0.0006). Fusobacteria was also significantly increased in healthy controls (0.25 vs 0.04%; q = 0.0111). The pathway enrichment analysis of the bacterial metagenomes showed that 130 of 360 (36.1%) total metabolic modules were differentially abundant between studied groups. Genes for carbohydrate metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids (lysine, threonine, histidine, isoleucine, tryptophan, leucine and serine) and vitamins (ascorbate, thiamine and riboflavin) were decreased in dogs with CE, while genes involved in transport of molecules and homeostasis maintenance during oxidative stress (glutathione biosynthesis) were increased in CE.</p>
