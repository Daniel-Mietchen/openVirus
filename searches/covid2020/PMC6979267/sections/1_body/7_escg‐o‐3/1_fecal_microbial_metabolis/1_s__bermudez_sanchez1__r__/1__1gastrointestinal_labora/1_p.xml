<p>Several studies have reported intestinal microbial dysbiosis in dogs with chronic enteropathy. Limited data is available about the microbiota gene function in this pathology in dogs. Determining the functional attributes of the microbiome is essential for understanding their role on host metabolism and disease. The aim of this study was to compare the functional roles of the fecal microbiota in healthy dogs and dogs with CE by fecal DNA shotgun sequencing.</p>
