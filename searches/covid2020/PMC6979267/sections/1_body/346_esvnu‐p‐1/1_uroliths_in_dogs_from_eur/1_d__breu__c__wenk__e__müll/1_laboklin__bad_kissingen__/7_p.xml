<p>In CE cohorts, cystine uroliths were present in 11/13(=84.6%) of Irish terriers, a breed reported to have a genetic predisposition to cystine calculi. Cystine uroliths were also found in American Staffordshire terriers (25/30 = 83.8%), bulldogs (39/77 = 50.6%), French bullterriers (30/71 = 42.3%), huskies (5/12 = 41.7%) and Chihuahuas (61/177 = 34.5%). In CN cohorts having no Irish terriers population, cystine uroliths were primarily found in bulldogs (9/11 = 81.8%) and French bullterriers (7/9 = 70%).</p>
