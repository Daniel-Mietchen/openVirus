<p>Thirty‐two cats were included in this study. Overall median survival time was 28 days (range: 0 to 1566 days). Plasma creatinine concentration after 2 days of hospitalization (Crea
 <sub>48</sub>) was the best predictor of survival. A Crea
 <sub>48</sub> of less than 64 mg/L best predicted survival at 7, 30 (Se = 0.87; Sp = 0.77) and 90 days. A Crea
 <sub>48</sub> of less than 38 mg/L best predicted survival at 180 days. When Crea
 <sub>48</sub> was censored from the analysis a lower CSS and a younger age were also predictive of survival up to 90 days.
