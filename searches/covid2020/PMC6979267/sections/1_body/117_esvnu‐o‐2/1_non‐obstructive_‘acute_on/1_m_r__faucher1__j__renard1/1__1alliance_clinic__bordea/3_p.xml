<p>Medical records over 4 years from azotemic cats hospitalized for at least two days with acute signs and confirmed CKD based on ultrasonographic findings and/or previously documented azotemia were retrospectively reviewed. Cats with potential toxic, neoplastic or obstructive cause of azotemia were not included. Signalment, clinical signs (combined into a clinical severity score [CSS]), selected laboratory and diagnostic imaging results and outcome were registered. A machine learning‐based classification and regression trees method was used to assess predictors of survival at 7, 30, 90 and 180 days.</p>
