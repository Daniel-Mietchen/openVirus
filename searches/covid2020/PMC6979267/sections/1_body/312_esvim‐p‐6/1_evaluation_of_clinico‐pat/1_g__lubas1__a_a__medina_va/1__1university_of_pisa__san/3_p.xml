<p>Sixty‐seven cases of IMHA, both primary and secondary, admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital between May 2010 and July 2018, were included. Signalment, history, clinical signs, clinico‐pathological parameters and survival rate were collected. Patients were divided in two groups: 44 patients (IMHAnt) treated with immunosuppressive therapy alone (primary n = 36, secondary n = 8) and 23 patients (IMHAt), which received also a blood transfusion (primarily packed RBC) (primary n = 16, secondary n = 6). For all collected parameters, both groups were statistically compared.</p>
