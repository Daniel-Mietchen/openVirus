<p>The IMHAt patients compared to IMHAnt patients (un‐regarding to primary or secondary cause) presented: worse marks according to Tokyo Score System (TSS) (Chi Squared, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003); a lower erythrocyte count (T‐test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.039), hemoglobin concentration (T‐test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.029) and platelet count (Mann‐Withney, M‐W, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.008); a higher value of band neutrophils (M‐W, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.022), band neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (M‐W, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005), (band neutrophil/neutrophil) to lymphocyte ratio (M‐W, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006) and a lower value of lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (M‐W, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.013); a higher value of C‐reactive protein (M‐W, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.011) and activated partial thromboplastin time (M‐W, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.014); and a lower survival rate at day 120 (Kaplan‐Meyer, logrank, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004) and not at 7, 15 and 30 days. Blood transfusions were performed based on the severity of clinical and clinico‐pathological signs.
