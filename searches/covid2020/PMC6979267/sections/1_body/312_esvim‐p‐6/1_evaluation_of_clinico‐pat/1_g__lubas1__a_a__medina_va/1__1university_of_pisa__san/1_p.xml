<p>Immune‐Mediated Hemolytic Anaemia (IMHA) is a common hematological disorder in dogs. It can be primary or secondary and it is characterized by anti‐RBC antibodies production. IMHA requires a detailed diagnostic pathway as well as a complex therapeutic approach that can include blood transfusion. Unfortunately, IMHA presents a high mortality rate, especially within 15 days after onset.</p>
