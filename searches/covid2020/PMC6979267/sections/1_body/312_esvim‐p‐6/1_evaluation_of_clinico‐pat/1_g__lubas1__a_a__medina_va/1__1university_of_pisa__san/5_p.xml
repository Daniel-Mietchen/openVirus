<p>IMHAt patients showed a more severe disease (according to TSS), a greater acute inflammatory condition and more coagulative defects. The high death rate among IMHAt patients at 120 days was related to their critical condition, which is probably why the desired benefit of blood transfusion wasn't reached. However, a link between blood transfusions and the related worse clinical signs in IMHAt patients could not be ruled‐out. Finally, the leukocyte ratios in dogs affected by IMHA were assessed for the first time so far and they were proven to be useful markers of acute inflammation and could have a prognostic value.</p>
