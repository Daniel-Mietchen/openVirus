<p>Median age of study population was 12 years. Recruited cats were previously overweight (71%) with weight loss (80%). The most frequent biochemical abnormalities included elevation of liver enzymes (63%), hyperproteinemia (61%), hyperbilirubinemia (47%) and hypokalemia (54%). Median survival time (MST) was 955 days. Mortality rate of cats having at least one US finding compatible with biliary tract disease was significantly higher and MST was also 2,57 times shorter (
