<p>Three small animal clinics (A‐C), one medium‐sized (D) and one small primary opinion practice (D) were included. A minimum of 500 observations in clinics A‐C (100 observations per study area: pre‐operative preparation area, intensive care unit [ICU], animal housing area, examination area, consultation area) and 130 observations in practices D‐E (consultation area and animal housing area) were obtained. The WHO five moments for HH included: before touching a patient, before clean/aseptic procedures, after body fluid exposure/risk, after touching a patient and after touching patient surroundings. Hand disinfection with alcohol‐based handrubs or hand washing with water and soap were considered successful HH procedures. Frequency of HH [95% confidence intervals] based on Jeffreys approach were estimated using the software R version 3.4.4.</p>
