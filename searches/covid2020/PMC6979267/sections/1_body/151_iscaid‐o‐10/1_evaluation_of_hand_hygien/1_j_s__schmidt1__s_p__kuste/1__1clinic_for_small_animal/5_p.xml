<p>The study indicates an overall poor adherence to HH in small animal clinics and practices in Switzerland. HH was remarkably poor in critical areas such as the pre‐operative preparation area and before clean/aseptic procedures. In contrast to observations in human hospitals, adherence to HH was lower in nursing staff than in doctors. In conclusion, the study highlights the need to promote HH in small animal medicine, with special emphasis on training of nursing staff and personnel in pre‐operative preparation areas.</p>
