<p>A total of 3420 urine samples were identified, with positive culture results in 771 (22.5%). There was no increase in the frequency of positive bacterial cultures over the study period (interval relative risk (IRR) 0.98, 95%CI 0.92‐1.0, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.565). The relative effect of developing UTI was significantly higher in females than males (RE 1.42, 95%CI 1.26‐1.61, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The most commonly isolated microorganisms were 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (52.9%), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. (12.0%), 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. (5.8%), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. (5.7%) and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. (5.6%). The overall prevalence of resistance within the Enterobacteriaceae family was 45.6% for cefazolin, 33.8% for pradofloxacin, 32.1% for trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole, 30.9% for cefuroxime, 29.3% for enrofloxacin, 26.5% for marbofloxacin, 25.8% for amoxycillin clavulanate, 18.4% for cefovecin and 11.5% for fosfomycin. The prevalence of MDR infections ranged from 2.1% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2017 which meant an increased trend of MDR bacteria of 22% (IRR 1.22 CI95% 1.06‐1.42
