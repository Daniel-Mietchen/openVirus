<p>The results of canine urine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed between January 2010 and December 2017 at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Alfonso X El Sabio University were retrieved from the laboratory database. All samples were collected by cystocentesis and cultured within 24 hours of collection. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using the Kirby‐Bauer disc diffusion method. Multidrug resistance was defined as resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent in more than three different antimicrobial categories.</p>
