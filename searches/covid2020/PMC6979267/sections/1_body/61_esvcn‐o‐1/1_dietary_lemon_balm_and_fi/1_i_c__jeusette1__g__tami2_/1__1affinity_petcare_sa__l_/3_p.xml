<p>Compared with control diet, both supplemented diets were effective to reduce urinary cortisol in almost all the tested situations (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Compared with diet U, diet US resulted in a lower urinary cortisol concentration on average and after an overnight fast (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), difference for routine being marginal (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.096). Diet US resulted also in a marginal increase in serum serotonin (0.05 &lt; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.10) compared to the two other diets (C and U). Diet U resulted in a higher average score for unfamiliar person test while diet US mainly increased the tolerance to the presence of the unfamiliar person compared to C.
