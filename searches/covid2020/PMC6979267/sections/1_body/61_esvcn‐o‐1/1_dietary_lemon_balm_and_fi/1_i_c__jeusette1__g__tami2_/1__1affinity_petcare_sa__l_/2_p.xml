<p>Ten colony cats firstly received a control adult cat diet (diet C) for five weeks and then were randomly assigned to two groups to test diets U and US for five weeks, in a cross over design, with two weeks wash‐out period. Twenty‐four‐hour naturally voided urine was obtained at the end of each period, under routine conditions and following the application of mild‐stressors (open‐field test, overnight fast and blood sampling). Urinary cortisol and serum serotonin concentrations were measured and behaviour tests were performed (open‐field test and reaction to the presence of and contact with an unfamiliar person). Mixed models for repeated measurements (SPSS) were used to analyse the data.</p>
