<p>Cut off points for Actical accelometer readings for sedentary (lying, slight movement of trunk), moderate and high (trotting at speed of 8 km/h or more) were collected with one‐minute epoch lengths for sedentary (100 epochs) and high (117 epochs) activities. The upper limit for sedentary and lower limit for high activity was defined as mean +/−2 x SD (SD) and moderate as values between these. BOAS + (n = 10) dogs, BOAS ‐ (n = 9) dogs and normocephalic (n = 11) dogs of comparable body sizes wore the Actical collar over seven consecutive days. Statistical comparisons in activity levels between groups were performed with an ANOVA method, Tukey's correction was used in comparisons.</p>
