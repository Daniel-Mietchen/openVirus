<p>The median (1st, 3rd quartiles) USG of the canine samples was 1015 (1008, 1024). The mean (±SD) USG of the feline samples was 1033 (±11). There were no significant differences between the refractometric USG values of canine or feline urine samples before and after centrifugation. The mean bias between the refractometric and weight/volume determined USG values of the feline samples was 1,8 ± 2,4. Using the generally accepted feline correction formula changed the mean bias to −3,1 ± 3,6. For comparison, the mean bias of the canine samples was −2,9 ± 5,7.</p>
