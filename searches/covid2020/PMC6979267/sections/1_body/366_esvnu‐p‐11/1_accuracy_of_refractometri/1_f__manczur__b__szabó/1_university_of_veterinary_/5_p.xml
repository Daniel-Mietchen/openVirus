<p>Based on our results we can conclude that it is unnecessary to use different scales or correction formulas during the refractometric USG determination of canine or feline urine samples. The use of the feline correction formula may result in a clinically important underestimation of the USG. The USG measurements can be performed both on native and centrifuged urine samples if the urine is clear. The inaccuracies of the refractometers irrespective of the species should be taken into consideration during the clinical decision making.</p>
