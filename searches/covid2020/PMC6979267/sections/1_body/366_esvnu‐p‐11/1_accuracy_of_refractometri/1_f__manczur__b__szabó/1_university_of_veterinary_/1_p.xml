<p>Urine‚Äêspecific gravity (USG) is used as a proxy for urine concentration or osmolality and usually determined by using a refractometer. There is a long held belief that feline urine has higher specific refractivity than human or canine urine, thus human refractometer scales may result in falsely high readings for feline samples. There are some commercially available veterinary refractometers that are calibrated with different scales for cats and a conversion formula has also been recommended if a refractometer with human scale is used in order to avoid overestimation of the USG in cats. Two recent studies questioned whether a separate scale is necessary for the correct interpretation of the refractometer readings in feline urine.</p>
