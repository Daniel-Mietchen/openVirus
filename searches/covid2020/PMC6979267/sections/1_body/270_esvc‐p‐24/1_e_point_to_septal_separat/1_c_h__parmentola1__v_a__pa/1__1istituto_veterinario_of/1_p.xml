<p>E point to septal separation (EPSS) is the distance of the maximal early diastolic motion of the septal mitral valve leaflet (E‐point) to the interventricular septum measured using the M‐mode recordings. EPSS is an important index in the diagnosis of occult and symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as recently reported in the European screening guidelines for DCM in Doberman Pinschers. EPSS can be measured from the right parasternal long axis view (RPLA) or from the right parasternal short axis view (RPSA). However, no previous studies assessed if the EPSS values are different using different echocardiographic views. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare EPSS values obtained from the RPLA and RPSA views in different canine breeds.</p>
