<p>This was a prospective observational study. Dogs were presented to the Istituto Veterinario di Novara for routine screening purposes. All dogs underwent a complete clinical and echocardiographic examination performed in right and left lateral recumbency with a simultaneous ECG tracing. The measurement of the EPSS was obtained from both the RPLA and RPSA views. All measurements were performed offline by the same operator (OD) evaluating 3 cardiac cycles, and the mean values were calculated.</p>
