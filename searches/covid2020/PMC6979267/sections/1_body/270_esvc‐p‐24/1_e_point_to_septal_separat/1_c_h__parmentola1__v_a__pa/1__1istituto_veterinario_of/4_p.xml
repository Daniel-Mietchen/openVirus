<p>The EPSS measurement obtained from the RPLA and RPSA view might not be used interchangeably. The greater lateral and torsional movements of the heart obtained from the short axis view during respiratory phases and cardiac cycle, might be the reason for the higher values of EPSS obtained from the RPSA view. This finding could be taken into account for an adequate echocardiographic evaluation and diagnosis. Further study with a larger canine population is warranted to confirm this result.</p>
