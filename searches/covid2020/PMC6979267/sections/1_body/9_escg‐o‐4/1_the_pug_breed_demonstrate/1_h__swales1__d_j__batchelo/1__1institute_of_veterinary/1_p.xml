<p>‘Protein‐losing‐enteropathy’ (PLE) is a syndrome caused by various diseases including idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, primary lymphangiectasia, lymphoma, and severe acute gastroenteritis. Certain breed predispositions, such as the soft‐coated Wheaten Terrier, are well known. Our clinical experience suggests that pugs with PLE respond poorly to treatment, but this is not described in the literature. The aim of the current study was to assess whether the pug breed demonstrates a worse response to treatment for PLE than other breeds of dog.</p>
