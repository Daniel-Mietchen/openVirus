<p>This was a retrospective study comparing the response to treatment in all pugs diagnosed with PLE between 2009 and 2018 in five referral centres in the United Kingdom. Approval for the study was granted by the University of Liverpool Research Ethics Committee. A group of non‐pug dogs, also diagnosed with PLE within the same period, was selected for comparison. PLE was defined as any gastrointestinal disease resulting in serum albumin below the laboratory reference interval that could not be explained by another cause. Factors associated with survival were assessed using simple statistics (Mann‐Whitney tests and chi‐square test as appropriate) and Cox's proportional hazards regression. Initially, factors were tested individually using simple regression; a multiple regression model was then created, subsequently refined by backwards stepwise elimination until the best model was found.</p>
