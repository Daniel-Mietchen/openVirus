<p>A total of 35 pugs were diagnosed with a PLE between 2009 and 2018 and were compared with 113 dogs from other breeds. On simple regression analysis, factors associated with survival (at P &lt; 0.1) were pug breed (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002), diet used for treatment (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.022), receiving immunosuppressive therapy (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.089), and treatment with cobalamin (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005). However, the only factors that remained in the final model were the pug breed and the diet used for treatment. In this respect, dogs of the pug breed were associated with a greater hazard of dying (compared with non‐pugs: hazards ratio [HR] 2.67 (CI 1.60‐4.47; P &lt; 0.001), whilst being fed a hydrolysed diet was associated with a lesser hazard risk of death than when fed other diets (compared with low‐fat diets: HR 0.50, 95%‐CI: 0.26‐0.97; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.042; compared with other diets including highly‐digestible diets: HR 0.35, 95%‐CI: 0.17‐0.71; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004).
