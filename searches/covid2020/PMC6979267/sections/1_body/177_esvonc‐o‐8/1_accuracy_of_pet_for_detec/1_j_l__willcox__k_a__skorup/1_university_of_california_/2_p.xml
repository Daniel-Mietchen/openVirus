<p>Client‐owned dogs with cytologically/histologically diagnosed OMM were eligible for this prospective study. A PET scan of the head/neck using 
 <sup>18</sup>Fluorine‐fluorodeoxyglucose (
 <sup>18</sup>F‐FDG) was performed followed by computed tomography. Bilateral mandibular lymphadenectomy was performed for histopathologic assessment. Scans were evaluated by two independent observers. First, observers were blinded to primary tumor laterality and graded subjectively comparing 
 <sup>18</sup>F‐FDG uptake to background. Subsequently, observers were unblinded to primary tumor information and utilized standard uptake value (SUV) quantification for evaluation. Interobserver agreement and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis were performed.
