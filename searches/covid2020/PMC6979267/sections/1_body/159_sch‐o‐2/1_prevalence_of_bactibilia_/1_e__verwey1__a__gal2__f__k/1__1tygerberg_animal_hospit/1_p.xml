<p>Bacterial cholecystitis is a debilitating disease in dogs. The presence of bacteria in bile in ill dogs would be significant if bile was considered sterile; however, the prevalence of bactibilia in healthy dogs is unknown. The primary purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of bactibilia in healthy dogs. Secondary aims were to determine if differences between bactibillic and non‚Äêbactibillic healthy dogs occur with regards to serum liver enzymes activities; and liver and gallbladder histopathology.</p>
