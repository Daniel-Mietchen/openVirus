<p>Fifty‐five healthy, abandoned dogs euthanased for non‐medical reasons were included in this cross‐sectional, prospective study. Dogs were deemed healthy based on clinical and necropsy examinations. Whole blood, bile, gallbladder wall and liver samples were collected aseptically from all dogs within 30 minutes of euthanasia and submitted for bacterial culture, cytological, biochemical (alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma‐glutamyl transferase (GGT)) and histopathological analyses. Agreement between cytology and culture was assessed with Cohen κ analysis and analysis of variance of serum liver enzymes activities between dogs with bactibilia and without was performed using the Mann‐Whitney test.</p>
