<p>Thirteen female dogs (5/13 spayed) met the inclusion criteria. Median age was 96 months (72‐168), while median body weight was 15.2 kg (10.2‐35). Main clinical signs were dysuria (11/13) and stranguria (8/13); urethral obstruction was detected in 5/13 dogs. In 7/8 dogs for which results were available, urine microbial cultures were positive. All dogs had endoscopic evidence of irregular tissue projections into urethral lumen that extended along the entire urethra in 6/13 dog (ES = 2); urethral strictures were noted in 3/13 cases (ES = 3); 4/13 dogs had UO (ES = 4). At histopathology, lymphoplasmacytic (8/13), lymphoplasmacytic and neutrophilic (3/13), and granulomatous (2/13) inflammation was detected. Medical treatment was started in all dogs after diagnosis and included antimicrobials (10/13), glucocorticoids (5/13), nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatories (9/13) and immune‐suppressive medications (2/13). Median survival time was 12 months (5‐36). Short‐term complications included relapsing of clinical signs (11/13) and recurrent UTI (11/13); 5/13 dogs required additional interventional or surgical treatments to restore urethral patency. Variables associated with survival were age (HR 1.037, 95% CI 1.0068‐1.068, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .016), body weight (HR 0.858, 95% CI 0.746‐0.987, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .03), and developing of UO within 6 months after diagnosis (HR 6.050, 95% CI 1.065‐34.481, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .04).
