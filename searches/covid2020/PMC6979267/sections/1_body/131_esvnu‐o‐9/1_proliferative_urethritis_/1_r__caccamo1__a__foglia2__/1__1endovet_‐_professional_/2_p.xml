<p>Medical records of dogs that underwent cystoscopy and were diagnosed with PU by histopathology were retrospectively reviewed (2015‐2019). Dogs with a documented follow up period of at least 12 months after diagnosis were included. Results regarding signalment, clinical, cystoscopic, microbiological and histopathological findings were collected. An endoscopic score (ES) for grading urethral lesions was used: mild localized lesions (ES = 1), complete involvement without stenosis (ES = 2), urethral stenosis (ES = 3), and urethral obstruction (UO, ES = 4). Treatments, short‐term complications (&lt;6 months), survival time after diagnosis and variables associated with survival (12 months) were investigated. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and reported as median and (range). Survival analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis (P value &lt;.05 considered significant).</p>
