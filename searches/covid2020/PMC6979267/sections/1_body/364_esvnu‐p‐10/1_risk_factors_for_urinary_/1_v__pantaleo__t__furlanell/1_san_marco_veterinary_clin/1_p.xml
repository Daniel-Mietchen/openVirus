<p>Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease. Due to the risk of dog‐to human transmission of leptospirosis and the need of monitoring urine output in dogs with acute kidney injury it is highly recommended to place an indwelling urinary catheter during hospitalization. Urinary catheterization can predispose to urinary tract infection (UTI). The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate type and frequency of UTI in dogs with leptospirosis and to identify risk factors associated with UTI in leptospirotic dogs.The electronic data‐base of the San Marco Veterinary Clinic P.O.A System‐Plus 9.0 was searched between January‐2008 and December‐2018 for dogs with diagnosis of leptospirosis (n = 78). Diagnosis of leptospirosis was consistent clinicopathologic signs, a positive microscopic agglutination test (titer ≥1:1600 in vaccinated dogs, titer ≥1:800 in non‐vaccinated dogs or ≥ 4‐fold increase in convalescent titer) and/or a positive PCR (urine and/or blood). Dogs with leptospirosis to be included in the study need to met the following criteria: negative urine sediment and urine culture at arrival, ≥ 3 days hospitalization, and a urine sample for cytologic examination and bacterial culture during hospitalization. Dogs meeting inclusion criteria were divided in 2 groups: catheterized dogs (group 1) and non‐catheterized dogs (group 2). Differences in UTI frequency between groups was evaluated (Fisher's exact test). Association between duration of catheterization and risk of developing UTI was analysed (Wilcoxon‐Mann‐Whitney test). Age, sex, diarrhoea, antecedent antibacterial and/or immunosuppressive treatment were evaluated for association with UTI (Chi‐square test). Significance level for all statistical test was set at α &lt; 0.05. A total of 76 dogs met inclusion criteria: 25 in group 1 and 51 in group 2. Overall 5/76 (7%, all in group 1) dogs developed a UTI. Identified bacteria were: 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (3 dogs), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (1 dog) and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (1 dog). All UTI were defined as multidrug‐resistant. Frequency of UTI was significantly higher in group 1 (5/25, 20%) compared to group 2 (0/51, 0%; OR = ∞; CI = 2.082 — ∞). Infected dogs had a significantly longer catheterization time (median = 6 days, IQR = 2.3) compared to non‐infected dogs (median = 2 days, IQR = 2.6; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.026). Age, sex, diarrhoea, antecedent antibacterial and/or immunosuppressive treatment were not significantly associated with UTI. Urinary catheterization and duration of urinary catheterization represented important risk factors for development of UTI in dogs with Leptospirosis.
