<p>Cross‐sectional study retrospectively evaluating client‐owned cats with heart disease presented between 2004 and 2018. All cats included underwent a full echocardiography evaluation and thoracic radiographs. Cats were divided into 3 groups: without CHF (group 1), with cardiogenic pulmonary edema (group 2) and with pleural effusion (group 3). Frequency of ATE among groups was compared by chi‐square test. The LA diameter and the LA/aorta ratio (LA:Ao) were also compared between cats with and without ATE (T‐test) and also among the 3 groups (Anova followed by Tamhane post‐hoc analysis).</p>
