<p>Aortic thromboembolism (ATE) is a frequently‚Äêseen cardiac complication in cats and left atrial (LA) enlargement is considered a risk factor. In dogs, activation of coagulation followed by fibrinolysis occurs in all types of pleural effusions and dogs with pleural effusion of any type or with ascites secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) show an enhanced systemic fibrinolysis, which may decreases clot formation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether cardiopathic cats with pleural effusion were less likely to develop aortic thromboembolism (ATE) than cats without pleural effusion.</p>
