<p>In the study were included 629 cats (group 1 = 420, group 2 = 71, and group 3 = 138). Sixty‐one cats at time of presentation had ATE, overall prevalence of 9.7%. LA in cats with ATE (20.16 ± 4.48 mm) was significantly (t = 8.90, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) bigger than in cats without ATE (15.23 ± 4.7). LA:Ao in cats with ATE (2.25 ± 0.49) was significantly (t = 8.16, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) higher than in cats without ATE (1.68 ± 0.52). Frequency of ATE was statistically (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 47.29, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) different among the 3 groups (group 1, 30/420 [7.1%]; group 2, 23/71 [32.4%]; group 3, 8/138 [5.8%]). LA was significantly (F = 79.3, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) increased in cats of group 2 (19.80 ± 5.31 mm) and group 3 (18.17 ± 3.97 mm) compared to group 1 (14.20 ± 3.38 mm), while no significant difference was present between groups 2 and 3. LA:Ao was significantly (F = 66.6, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) increased in cats of group 2 (2.24 ± 0.55) and group 3 (2.10 ± 0.51) compared to group 1 (1.53 ± 0.43), while no significant difference was present between groups 2 and 3.
