<p>Descriptive statistics revealed comparable groups apart from an overweight of small medium breed dogs (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) in the CE group. The mean ± SD [25(OH)D
 <sub>3</sub>] was 271.4 ± 95.2 nmol/L for healthy dogs, 205.9 ± 62.1 nmol/L for AE and 196.5 ± 76.7 nmol/L for CE and not statistically different between groups (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.1). A negative correlation between [25(OH)D
 <sub>3</sub>] and CRP (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in dogs with AE was observed. No significant difference in electrolytes were found between groups. There was no correlation between [25(OH)D
 <sub>3</sub>] and dietary Vitamin D
