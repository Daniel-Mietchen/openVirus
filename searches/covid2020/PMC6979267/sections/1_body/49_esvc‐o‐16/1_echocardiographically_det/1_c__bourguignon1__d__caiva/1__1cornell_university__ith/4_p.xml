<p>Our study suggests that little difference exists in estimates of LV volume from the two echocardiographic views, and that the estimates are interchangeable in dogs with a range of cardiac diseases and disease severities. Additionally, our data provide reference limits for volumes indexed to weight, which is both mathematically and physiologically more appropriate than indexing to surface area.</p>
