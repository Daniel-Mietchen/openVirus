<p>Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) volume estimates can help clinicians identify and quantify cardiomegaly and cardiac function in dogs. Cardiologists can obtain these estimates from different views and index them against body size to normalize them for comparisons between individuals and to classify them into ranges of disease severity. However, to‚Äêdate, studies comparing estimates obtained from different views have been performed by only one group of investigators examining specific breeds. Therefore, we examined the agreement between two methods of obtaining LV volume estimates in dogs with a range of diseases and disease states. We also generated reference intervals for LV volume indices.</p>
