<p>Systolic and diastolic LV volume estimates obtained by the two methods agreed, showing no fixed or proportional biases. Only 2 dogs showed markedly different LV volumes between the two methods. The 95% limits of agreement were approximately 1.0 ml/kg for diastolic LV volume index and 0.5 ml/kg for systolic LV volume index. Healthy dogs had an upper limit of 4.8 ml/kg and 2.2 ml/kg (left apical view) or 4.3 ml/kg and 2.0 ml/kg (right parasternal view) in diastole and systole, respectively. The 90% confidence intervals of each of these limits included the point estimate of the complementary method. Diastolic, but not systolic, LV volume index increased with increasing LA:Ao in dogs with mitral valve disease (
