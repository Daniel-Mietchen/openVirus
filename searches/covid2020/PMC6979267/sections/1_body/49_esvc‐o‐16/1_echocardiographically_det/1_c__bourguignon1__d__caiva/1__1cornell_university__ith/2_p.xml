<p>Five investigators contributed echocardiographic data from 199 dogs; one dog was excluded from the analyses. The LV of each dog was measured in triplicate using a Simpson's single plane method, from either the right parasternal long axis view or the left apical 4‐chamber view, in systole and diastole. The 3 measurements were averaged, and the two methods were compared using limits‐of‐agreement analyses. Volumes were indexed to bodyweight and to body surface area. Reference intervals were created from measurements obtained on 73 healthy dogs. Indexed LV dimensions were regressed against LA:Ao in 82 dogs with mitral valve disease.</p>
