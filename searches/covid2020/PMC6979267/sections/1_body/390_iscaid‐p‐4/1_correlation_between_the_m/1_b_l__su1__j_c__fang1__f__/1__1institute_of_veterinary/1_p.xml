 <italic>Babesia gibsoni</italic> and 
 <italic>Babesia vogeli</italic> have both been identified in canine babesiosis in Taiwan, where information on the epidemiology of the disease is limited. Although direct transmission of 
 <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> between fighting dogs has been reported from the USA, Korea and Romania, this mode of transmission does not occur in Taiwan. The objective of our study was to correlate the distribution of 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> with the distribution of ticks infesting dogs in Taiwan.
