<p>An average of 7.8 ticks was collected from 261 dogs in the north of Taiwan, 83 dogs in the middle and 45 dogs from the south of Taiwan. Five different species of ticks were found: 
 <italic>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic> (throughout Taiwan), 
 <italic>Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides</italic> (only in the north), 
 <italic>Haemaphysalis hystricis</italic> (only in the north and middle of Taiwan), 
 <italic>Amblyomma testidunarium</italic> and 
 <italic>Ixodes ovatus</italic> (both only in the north). The prevalence of 
 <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> and 
 <italic>B. vogeli</italic> infection was 13.4% (56/389) and 10.3% (40/389), respectively. Most positive 
 <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> dogs were found in the northern part of the country 51/56 (91%), whereas a few were found in the middle part 5/56 (9%). 
 <italic>Babesia vogeli</italic> infections were distributed as follows: 29/40 (72.5%) in the north, 3/40 (7.5%) in the middle and 8/40 (20%) in the south of the country. None of the dogs in the south were infected with 
 <italic>B gibsoni</italic>, which correlated with the absence of 
 <italic>H. hystricis</italic>, a tick recently identified as the local vector for 
 <italic>B gibsoni</italic>. 
 <italic>Babesia vogeli</italic> was more equally distributed coinciding with the occurrence of 
 <italic>R.sanguineus,</italic> which tick is present throughout Taiwan. These findings are discussed in relation to the local clinical relevance and treatment of canine babesiosis in Taiwan.
