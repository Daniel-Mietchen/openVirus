<p>A log‐rank test was performed on survival time with respect to disease type (MVD or DCM). No significance was found (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.37), although dogs with MVD (median = 452 days) had on average longer survival time than those with DCM (median = 184 days). Univariate Cox proportional‐hazards models were performed for every marker. The following markers were significantly associated with survival (HR; 95% CI; P value): WBC (1.139; 1.049, 1.237; 0.002), NEUT (1.184; 1.074, 1.305; 0.001), MONO (7.502; 2.044, 27.532; 0.002), CRP (1.000; 1‐000, 1.000; 0.008), TNF‐α (1.078; 1.018, 1.142; 0.010), Il‐6 (1.009; 1.000, 1.017; 0.039) and GPX (0.992; 0.986,0.999; 0.025). If we interpret some of the results: an increase of NEUT for 1 unit (x10
 <sup>9</sup>/L) increased the risk of death by 18.4%, while an increase of GPX (U/g of haemoglobin) for 50 units decreased the risk of death by 33%. Furthermore, Cox models were fitted, with ISACHC and an additional marker as covariates, since survival was significant with respect to ISACHC class (log‐rank test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0004). In these models, the effect of the above markers decreased; however, GPX (0.992; 0.985,0.999; 0.025) and NEUT (1.122; 1.007,1.249; 0.036) remained significantly associated with survival.
