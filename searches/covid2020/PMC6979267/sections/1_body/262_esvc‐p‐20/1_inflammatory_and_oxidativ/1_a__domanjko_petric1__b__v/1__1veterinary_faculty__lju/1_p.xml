<p>Various factors can influence survival of dogs with mitral valve disease (MVD) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In canine cardiovascular patients, inflammatory and antioxidant markers have not been investigated in terms of association with survival, yet. Thus, we investigated the association of inflammatory (white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil (NEUT) and monocyte (MONO) counts, C‐reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) and interleukin‐6 (Il‐6)) and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde), vitamin E and glutathione peroxidase (GPX)) markers with survival in dogs with MVD and DCM.</p>
