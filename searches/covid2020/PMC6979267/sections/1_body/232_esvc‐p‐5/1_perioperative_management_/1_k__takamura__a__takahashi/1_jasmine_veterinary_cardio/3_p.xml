<p>The study included 104 dogs. Five (4.8%) underwent catheter insertion into the femoral artery (group F), and 99 (95.2%), into either the dorsalis pedis (n = 96) or caudalis median (n = 3) peripheral arteries (group P). Group F required a median 8 min (range 6‐13 min) for catheter insertion and a median 18 min (range 10‐29 min) for catheter removal. Three dogs in group F bled after heparin infusion during surgery. There was no bleeding in group P, and the pulse was palpable immediately after surgery. Good pressure waveforms were obtained during all perioperative periods, and blood collection was uneventful. There were no adverse events after surgery in both groups. Operation time did not differ significantly between the two groups.</p>
