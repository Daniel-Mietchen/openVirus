<p>Lymphoma is the most common haematopoetic neoplasm in the canine population. Chemotherapy protocols, such as COP, CHOP and LOPP are used to treat lymphoma due to its chemosensitive nature. These protocols routinely involve vincristine. Current literature reports the most common vincristine induced toxicity to be gastrointestinal effects but also suggests a degree of myelosupression especially during combination protocols. Little research has focused on the myelosupressive effects of vincristine alone and after a single dose. Neutropenia leading to treatment delays or dose reductions, have been associated with longer remission times.</p>
