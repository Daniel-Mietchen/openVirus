<p>Four dogs (9%) experienced neutropenia (neutrophil count &lt;2.0 x 10^9/L) following a single administration of vincristine, two of which were borderline neutropenic at the start. Two dogs developed VCOG grade 4 neutropenia, one dog grade 3 and one grade 2. The study population had a mean neutrophil count of 9.96 x 10^9 (range 1.25‐55.22 x 10^9/L), prior to vincristine administration and a mean of 8.7 x 10^9/L (range 0.4‐35.2 x 10^9/L), one week post vincristine. 27/44 (61%) cases had a decreased neutrophil count on the second sample. Neither weight nor age influenced likelihood of developing neutropenia.</p>
