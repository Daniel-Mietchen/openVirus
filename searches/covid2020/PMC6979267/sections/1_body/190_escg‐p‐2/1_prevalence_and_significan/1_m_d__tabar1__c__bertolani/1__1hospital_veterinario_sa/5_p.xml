<p>In 38 of the 76 patients with increased TLI, cPLI was also determined (semi‐quantitative and/or quantitative analyses) with results consistent with pancreatitis in 50%(19/38). Among patients with normal cPLI results, pancreatitis was suspected in 2 based on pancreatic histology (n = 1) and abdominal ultrasound (n = 1), and non‐cirrhotic portal hypertension (n = 1) and gastrointestinal disease (n = 16) were diagnosed in the other 17 patients. Gastrointestinal disease was confirmed in 11 cases [food‐responsive enteropathy (5), IBD (4), gastrointestinal neoplasia (2)] and pressumptive in 5 patients (chronic enteropathy).</p>
