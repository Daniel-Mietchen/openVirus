<p>Results of serum TLI measurements were retrospectively reviewed from samples from animals evaluated for different diseases from two Veterinary Hospitals, performed in an outside laboratory (Idexx Barcelona) using a radioimmunoassay (feline) and chemiluminescent‐assay (canine). Clinical records from patients with elevated TLI levels (&gt;45 ng/L for dogs and &gt; 82 μg/L for cats) were reviewed.</p>
