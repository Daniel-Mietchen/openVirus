<p>In the present study 76,9% (40/52) of cases with increased TLI and without pancreatitis or azotemia had confirmed or suspected underlying gastrointestinal disease, coincident with previous feline and human findings. In fact TLI was performed in those cases to rule out exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Although cobalamin deficiency has been linked to increased feline TLI (that normalized after supplementation), this study didn't detect a significant correlation between cobalamin and TLI levels. Other yet undefined mechanisms likely explain the production of TLI in absence of pancreatic inflammation, and TLI levels must be carefully interpreted in animals with gastrointestinal disease.</p>
