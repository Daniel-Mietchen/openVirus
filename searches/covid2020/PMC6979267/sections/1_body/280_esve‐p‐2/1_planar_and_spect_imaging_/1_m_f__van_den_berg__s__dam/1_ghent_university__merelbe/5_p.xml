<p>Uptake relative to the parotid salivary glands (thyroid/salivary (T/S) ratio) was increased in 35 of 62 dogs (median T/S ratio 3.2 (1.1‐12)), decreased in 15 dogs (median T/S ratio 0.73 (0.36‐0.90)), and comparable to that of the salivary glands (median T/S ratio 0.96 (0.85‐1.0)) in 8 dogs. In 4 dogs with multiple masses, uptake extent was different at the level of the various masses. A homogeneous, uniform uptake pattern was present in 10 dogs and a heterogeneous uptake pattern in 45 dogs. In 7 dogs (all with multiple masses), various uptake patterns were present.</p>
