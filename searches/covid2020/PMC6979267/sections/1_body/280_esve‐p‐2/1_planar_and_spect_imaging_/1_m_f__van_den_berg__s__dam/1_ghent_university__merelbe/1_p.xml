<p>Thyroid scintigraphy is indispensable for the diagnosis, staging and treatment planning of thyroid carcinoma. However, literature on pertechnetate (
 <sup>99m</sup>TcO4) and iodine‐123 (
 <sup>123</sup>I) scintigram findings in dogs is scarce, and nearly absent on single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Similar to human medicine, the use of SPECT could increase the sensitivity in detection of metastases.
