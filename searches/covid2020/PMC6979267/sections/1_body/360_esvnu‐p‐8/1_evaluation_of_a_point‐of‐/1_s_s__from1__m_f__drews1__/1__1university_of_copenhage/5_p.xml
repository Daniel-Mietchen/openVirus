<p>Surplus urine samples from 79 dogs and 21 cats were included (58% by cystocentesis). Forty‐four samples yielded ≥1000 colony forming units (CFU)/ml on QBC, of which 20 yielded heavy growth (≥100 000 CFU/mL). POC sensitivity and specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 71%, 77%, 71% and 77%, respectively. Eight of the 13 false negative samples grew 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. By applying a cut‐off of ≥100 000 CFU/mL, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values changed to 80%, 65%, 36% and 93%, respectively. The intra‐assay and inter‐rater coefficients of variation were 1.4‐3.23% and 83%, respectively.
