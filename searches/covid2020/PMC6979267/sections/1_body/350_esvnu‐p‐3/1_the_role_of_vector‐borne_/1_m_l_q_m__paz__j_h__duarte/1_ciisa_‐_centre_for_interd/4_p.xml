<p>106 dogs were selected. From these, 54% were females and 46% were males, with an average of 9.5 years old (range between 0.83 and 16 years old). None had pre‐renal proteinuria, 76% had renal proteinuria, 17% had post‐renal proteinuria and 7% had a suspected mixed origin (renal+post‐renal). Detailing renal proteinuria, 46% had a presumptive diagnosis of glomerulonephritis secondary to CVBD, 27% showed chronic kidney disease, 26% had systemic diseases possibly inducing an impaired glomerular permselectivity (bronchopneumonia, enteropathies, liver disease, hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus or neoplasia) and 1% had acute kidney injury (AKI). Post‐renal proteinuria included dogs with pyometra and urinary tract infection (UTI). Mixed proteinuria was considered in dogs with systemic diseases (CVBD, CKD, AKI and hyperadrenocorticism) and a concurrent UTI and/or cystitis.</p>
