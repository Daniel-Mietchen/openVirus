<p>Of 245 dogs with proven or suspected UTI, 215 (87.8%) received antimicrobials. In only 36.3% of these, a bacterial etiology was confirmed via culture and/or sediment examination. Antimicrobial classes used were potentiated aminopenicillins (61%), fluoroquinolones (22%), NP‐aminopenicillins (11%), first‐generation cephalosporins (5%), third‐generation cephalosporins (1%), lincosamides (0.8%), amphenicols and potentiated sulfonamides (0.4% each). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed in 73/85 (86%) of the cases where bacterial culture was performed. In 20% (49/245), antimicrobial therapy was judged appropriate (JS‐1), in 16% (39/245) inappropriate (JS‐2n = 5; JS‐3 n = 30).</p>
