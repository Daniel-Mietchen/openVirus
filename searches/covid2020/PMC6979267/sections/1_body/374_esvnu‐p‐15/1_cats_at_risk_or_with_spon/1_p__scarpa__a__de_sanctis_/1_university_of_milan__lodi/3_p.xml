<p>One hundred thirty three cats, from a starting population of 472 (years 2013‐2018), were included in this study. One or more of the following criteria had to be observed during their first clinical examination: age over 9 years, serum creatinine (SCr) &gt;1.6 mg/dL, borderline (0,2‐0,4) or pathologic (&gt;0,4) urinary protein/creatinine ratio (UPC), urine specific gravity (USG) &lt;1.035. Furthermore, their “follow‐up data” have been obtained through an online questionnaire filled by the owners (beginning of 2019). The nephropathic cats were staged according to IRIS guidelines, and not nephropathic cats were included in stage 0.</p>
