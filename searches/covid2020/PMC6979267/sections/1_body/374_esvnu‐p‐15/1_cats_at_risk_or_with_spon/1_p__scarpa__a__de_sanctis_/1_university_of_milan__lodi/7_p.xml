<p>Sixty (45,1%) cats were naturally dead or euthanized at the time of the survey; 25 (18,8%) of these due to CKD. Some parameters were significantly different between the two groups: “dead by CKD” and “dead by other diseases”. Serum creatinine was higher, while USG, red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) and hematocrit (Ht) were significantly lower in “dead by CKD” cats. Survival time in nephropathic cats was related with age, IRIS staging, serum phosphorus, RBC, WBC, Ht. Cats staged as IRIS‐2 survived longer than cats staged as IRIS‐1, because other comorbidities are the reason for the consultation in stage‐1 cats. A lower survival time was observed in cats with a body condition score different than normal (higher or lower). Lower survival was observed in hypertensive conditions when the whole population of cats was considered, and not only the CKD one.</p>
