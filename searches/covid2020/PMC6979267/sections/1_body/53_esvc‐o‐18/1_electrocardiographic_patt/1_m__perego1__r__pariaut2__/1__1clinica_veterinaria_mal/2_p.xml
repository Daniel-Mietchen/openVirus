<p>Records of 26 privately‐owned dogs with documented AP were retrospectively reviewed. For all dogs 12‐lead ECG and detailed electrophysiologic mapping were analyzed. The dogs were classified in three groups according to the position of the AP: antero and mid‐septal (6/26), right posterior and right lateral (9/26) and right postero‐septal (11/26). For each ECG, measurements on 3 different beats were performed for the following parameters: P‐delta wave (d) interval and segment duration, d duration, morphology and axis (at 20 and 40 ms), d‐Q, d‐R, d‐R’ and d‐S duration, morphology and axis. Descriptive statistics were performed and on quantitative variables normal distribution of values was assessed by the Shapiro‐Wilk W‐test and mean, median, quartiles and standard deviations were calculated. Kruskal‐Wallis one‐way analysis‐of‐variance‐by‐ranks test was used to evaluate difference between position and delta wave measured on each lead.</p>
