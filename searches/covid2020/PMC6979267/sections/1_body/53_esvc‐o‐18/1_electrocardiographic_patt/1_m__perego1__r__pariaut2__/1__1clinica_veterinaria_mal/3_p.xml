<p>In 20 dogs VPE was manifest and in 6 intermittent. The most common d‐QRS complex morphology in lead II was the multiple peak QRS (rR’, rRs) found in 18/26 dogs. Right posterior and right lateral APs had a taller d‐R and d‐S respectively in lead I (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.04) and II (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) Antero and mid‐septal APs had a taller d‐R’ in lead III (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.04) and a taller d‐S in lead V
