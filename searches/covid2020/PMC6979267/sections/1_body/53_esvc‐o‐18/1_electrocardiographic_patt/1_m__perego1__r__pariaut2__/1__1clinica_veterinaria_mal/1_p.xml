<p>Ventricular pre‐excitation (VPE) describes the activation of a portion of the ventricular myocardium along an accessory pathway (AP), which occurs sooner than if an electrical impulse only conducted along the normal His‐Purkinje system. Ventricular pre‐excitation has been documented in 1/3 of the dogs with APs. The aims of our study were to explore the electrocardiographic (ECG) features of VPE and identify ECG criteria to determine AP location in this species.</p>
