<p>At EHPSS diagnosis, median sHA was 337.20 ng/mL (158.02‐790.66 ng/mL). After successful surgery (closed PSS), sHA dropped to 36.62 ng/mL (13.51‐92.24 ng/mL) whereas in dogs with persistent portosystemic shunting, sHA remained higher (median 135.70 ng/mL; 56.44‐312.04 ng/mL). Kruskal‐Wallis tests revealed a significant difference between sHA in dogs with closed versus open EHPSS (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.025 at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively, respectively). The median sHA of dogs with other liver diseases was 119.64 ng/mL (48.44‐160.00 ng/mL), which was significantly lower compared to dogs at the moment of EHPSS diagnosis (
