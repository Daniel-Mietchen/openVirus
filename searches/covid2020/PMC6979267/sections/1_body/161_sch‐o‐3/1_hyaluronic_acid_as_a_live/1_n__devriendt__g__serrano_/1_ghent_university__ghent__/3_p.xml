<p>Twenty dogs with surgically treated EHPSS and 10 dogs with other liver diseases were included. Dogs with EHPSS had a blood sample taken at diagnosis, 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. At the 3‐month control visit a transsplenic portal scintigraphy was performed to determine shunt closure status. Dogs with other liver diseases were only sampled at a single time point and comprised of: Maltese dogs with moderately increased postprandial bile acids and no liver disease based on imaging (n = 3), dogs with histologically confirmed portal vein hypoplasia (n = 4) or histologically confirmed chronic hepatitis (n = 3). All samples were analysed in batch using a commercially available ELISA kit (Hyaluronan Quantikine, R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis).</p>
