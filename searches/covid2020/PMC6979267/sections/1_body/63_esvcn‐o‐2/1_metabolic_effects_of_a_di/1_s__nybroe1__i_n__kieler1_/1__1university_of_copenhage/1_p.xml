<p>The use of probiotics is believed to have health promoting effects such as stabilising the gut microbiome, increase short‚Äêchain fatty acid (SCFA) production and lower circulating cholesterol levels. However, probiotic supplementation may also affect the vitamin B metabolism and there are indications that circulating cobalamin may be depleted to levels below reference levels in dogs. Yet, probiotic effects are highly strain specific. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a commercial complete diet containing
