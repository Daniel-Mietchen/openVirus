<p>Ten healthy client owned dogs were included in this randomized prospective double‐blinded crossover study. All dogs went through a 7 days acclimatisation period of gradual transit from their regular diet to the control diet. The acclimatisation period was followed by two study periods of each 35 days. In each study period, the dogs were randomly assigned to start being fed the control diet (CD) or probiotic diet (PD) (control diet supplemented with

 <sup>9</sup> cfu/kg). Blood samples and rectal faecal samples were collected at inclusion (I) at day 0 and at the end of each feeding period (day 42 and 77). The faecal quality was scored daily by the owner. Results are presented as mean ± SD, and a difference of
