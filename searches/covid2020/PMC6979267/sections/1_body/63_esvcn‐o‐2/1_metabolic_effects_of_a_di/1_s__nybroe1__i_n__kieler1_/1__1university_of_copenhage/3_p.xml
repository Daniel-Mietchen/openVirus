<p>A significant reduction in serum cholesterol (I: 6.5 ± 2.22 vs PD: 5.40 ± 1.71 mmol/L) and increased faecal content of butyrate was found in the PD relative to I. For both PD and CD, serum cobalamin was significantly reduced (I: 442 ± 110 vs CD: 381 ± 73 and PD: 359 ± 77 ng/L) but within the reference interval (235‐812 ng/L) and faecal concentration of acetate was significantly increased compared to I. No changes were found in serum concentration of triglycerides and folic acid or in the faecal concentration of propionate or faecal quality.</p>
