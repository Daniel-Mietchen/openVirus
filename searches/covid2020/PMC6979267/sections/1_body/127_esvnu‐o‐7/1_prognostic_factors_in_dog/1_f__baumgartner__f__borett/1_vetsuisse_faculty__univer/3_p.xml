<p>Over all dogs, increased UPC was identified as a risk factor for death (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Median time of survival was 42 days. UPC and time of survival did not differ significantly between the groups. Among dogs with glomerulopathy, identified significant risk factors for death included increased UPC (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03), increased creatinine (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), low haematocrit (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.04) and low urine specific gravity (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). In dogs with Cushing's disease, only urine specific gravity was a significant risk factor for death (p = 0.05). In dogs with leishmaniosis, increased UPC and creatinine were significant risk factors for death (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; p &lt; 0.01).
