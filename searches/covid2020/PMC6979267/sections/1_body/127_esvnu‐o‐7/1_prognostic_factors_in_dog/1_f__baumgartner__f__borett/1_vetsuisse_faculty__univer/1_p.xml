<p>Little is known about the impact of increased urine protein:creatinine ratios (UPC) on survival of dogs with different underlying diseases, and associated risk factors for death are not established. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess dogs with severe proteinuria (UPC at least once during the disease measured &gt;2.0) for their survival time, underlying diseases and possible prognostic factors like UPC at time of diagnosis, creatinine, urine specific gravity, albumin and haematocrit.</p>
