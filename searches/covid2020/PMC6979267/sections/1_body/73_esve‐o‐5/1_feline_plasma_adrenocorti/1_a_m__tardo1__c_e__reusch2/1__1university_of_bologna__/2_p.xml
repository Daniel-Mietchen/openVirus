<p>Thirty‐three healthy cats and 25 cats with OD (9 cats with diabetes mellitus; 5 with hyperthyroidism; 3 each with chronic kidney disease, or gastrointestinal disease; 2 with acute kidney injury; and 1 each with hypovolemic shock, septic shock, or hyperaldosteronism) were included prospectively in the study. Data from 11 cats with PH and 9 with HC (8 pituitary‐dependent hypercortisolism ‐ PDH ‐ and 1 adrenal‐dependent hypercortisolism ‐ ADH) were retrieved from medical records of three referral centers (University of Bologna, Zurich and Utrecht) that use the same method of measurement (Immulite 2000). Left over samples, collected for diagnostic purposes, were used. The intra‐assay coefficients of variance (CVs) ranged from 2.6 to 3.6%, and interassay CVs from 6.6 to 13.2%, for samples with high and low concentrations of ACTH, respectively. Dilution studies performed on two samples with high concentrations of ACTH, using the diluent provided by the manufacturer, showed excellent accuracy (R
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.99). The RI for plasma endogenous ACTH in healthy cats, established using the Robust Method, was 27‐390 pg/mL (median 96 pg/mL). Plasma ACTH concentrations ranged from 23.6 to 400 pg/mL, 21.6 to 355.5 pg/mL, 331 to &gt;1250 pg/mL in healthy, OD and PDH cats, respectively; the only cat with ADH showed an ACTH value of 5 pg/mL (detection limit of the assay). In all the cats with PH the concentration of ACTH was &gt;1250 pg/mL. ACTH concentrations did not show significant differences between healthy and OD groups. Cats with PDH and PH had significantly higher ACTH values than the other groups. There was only 1 PDH cat with a result in the range of healthy and OD cats.
