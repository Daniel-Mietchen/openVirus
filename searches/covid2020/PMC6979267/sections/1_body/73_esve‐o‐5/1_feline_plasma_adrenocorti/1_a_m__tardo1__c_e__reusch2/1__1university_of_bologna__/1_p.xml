<p>Naturally occurring hypercortisolism (HC) and hypoadrenocorticism are rare conditions in cats and their diagnosis can be challenging. Actually, there is a lack of validation studies for the measurement of feline plasmatic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The aims of this study were to validate a commercially available chemiluminescent assay to measure feline ACTH concentrations, determine the normal reference interval (RI) and assess plasma endogenous ACTH concentrations in cats with primary hypoadrenocorticism (PH), HC and cats with other diseases (OD).</p>
