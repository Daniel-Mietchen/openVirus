<p>Immulite chemiluminescent assay is a valid technique for measurement ACTH in feline plasma and the RI is quite wide. Due to the low overlap between healthy or OD cats and those with PH or HC, measurement of endogenous ACTH seems useful and should be included in the diagnostic workup when PH or HC are suspected.</p>
