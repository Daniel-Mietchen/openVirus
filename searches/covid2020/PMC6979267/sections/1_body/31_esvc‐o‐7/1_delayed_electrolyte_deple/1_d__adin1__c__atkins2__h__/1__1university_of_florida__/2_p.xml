<p>Ten healthy dogs were studied in a 3‐way randomized, cross‐over design. Dogs orally received either placebo, benazepril, or benazepril+spironolactone for 3 days prior to 5‐hour furosemide CRI 0.66 mg/kg/hr. Body weight (BW), renal values, serum electrolytes, packed cell volume and total protein were measured before oral medications, hour 0 and 5 of the furosemide CRI, and hour 24. Variables were compared between time‐points and treatments.</p>
