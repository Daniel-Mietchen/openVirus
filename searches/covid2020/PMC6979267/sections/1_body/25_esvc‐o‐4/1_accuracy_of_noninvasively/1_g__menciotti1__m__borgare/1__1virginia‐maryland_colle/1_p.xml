<p>Development of pulmonary hypertension is an independent predictor of poor outcome in dogs affected by myxomatous valvular degeneration (MMVD). Pulmonary arterial pressure is routinely estimated by applying the simplified Bernoulli equation to the velocity of tricuspid regurgitation (PASP_D). The accuracy of this estimation is unknown in dogs with MMVD, but experimental studies suggest that the method is imperfect. We prospectively enrolled dogs affected by ACVIM stages B2 and C MMVD for which treatment had been unchanged for at least one month. A flow‐directed thermodilution monitoring catheter was percutaneously placed in the right jugular vein and advanced to the main pulmonary artery. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was recorded (PASP_C). A second operator simultaneously acquired tricuspid regurgitant velocity spectra to calculate PASP_D. Each operator was blinded to the result of the other technique. Twenty dogs were enrolled. Technical difficulties prevented catheterization in 2 dogs. Eighteen measurement pairs were therefore used for comparison of PASP_C and PASP_D through Bland‐Altman analysis and linear regression. A statistically significant bias between PASP_C and PASP_D (mean difference = 0.5 mmHg; Confidence interval: −6.5 mmHg, +7.5 mmHg) was not detected. The limits of agreement between the techniques were wide (−27.3 mmHg, +28.2 mmHg). Regression analysis failed to identify a significant linear association between the two techniques (

In these dogs, PASP_D could under‐ or over‐estimate PASP_C by more than 20 mmHg, and therefore caution should be used when interpreting PASP_D.
