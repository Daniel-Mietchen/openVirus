<p>The following conclusions were drawn based on the obtained results: 1) the ABB analysis based on the classic model enables detection of ABB disturbances in cats with stage IV kidney disease, 2) the analysis of the AG, AG
 <sub>corr,</sub>and Cl/Na
 <sup>+</sup> values enable the diagnosis of ABB disturbances in cats with stage II, III and IV kidney disease, 3) The analysis of the changes in the ion concentrations in CKD are a more accurate tool to diagnose ABB disturbances than the classic model.
