<p>The aim of the study was to assess the possibility of using the value of the anion gap (AG), corrected anion gap (AG
 <sub>corr</sub>) and the chloride/sodium ratio (Cl
 <sup>−</sup>/Na
 <sup>+</sup>) in the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis. The study was carried out on 100 cats (both sexes, 7‐9 years old). The control (C) group consisted of 20 healthy cats, while 80 cats that were diagnosed with CKD based on their blood creatinin, SDMA and urea levels were included in the study group. The cats with CKD were divided into four groups: I, II, III and IV, depending on the IRIS stage. Arterial and venous blood was collected from all the animals. Parameters of the acid‐base balance (ABB): pH, pCO
 <sub>2</sub> and HCO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> were measured in arterial blood. The concentration of Na
 <sup>+,</sup> K
 <sup>+</sup>, Cl
 <sup>−</sup>, HCO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>, albumin were measured in venous blood. Based on the obtained results, the values of the AG, AG
 <sub>corr</sub> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup>/Na
 <sup>+</sup> were calculated using the following formulae: AG = (Na
 <sup>+</sup> + K
 <sup>+</sup>) ‐ (Cl
 <sup>−</sup> ‐ HCO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>), AG
 <sub>corr</sub> = AG + (39 g/L ‐ alb
 <sub>akt</sub> g/l)/4, where 39 g/L was the upper reference limit of serum albumin in cats, alb
 <sub>akt</sub> was the measured albumin concentration in the studied cats and Cl
 <sup>−</sup>/Na
 <sup>+</sup> = (Cl
 <sup>−</sup>): (Na
 <sup>+</sup>).
