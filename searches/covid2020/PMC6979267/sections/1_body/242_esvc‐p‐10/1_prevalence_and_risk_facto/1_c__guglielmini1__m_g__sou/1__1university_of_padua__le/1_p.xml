<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common canine supraventricular arrhythmia usually observed in large breed dogs with cardiac disease associated with left atrial enlargement. Although some epidemiologic data and risk factors for AF have been reported, no study has thoroughly examined the prevalence and risk factors for this arrhythmia in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of AF in a large population of dogs with MMVD and to identify the risk factors for AF development in these animals.</p>
