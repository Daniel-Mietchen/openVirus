<p>A total of 2194 dogs were enrolled, including 1280, 588, 290, and 36 dogs in ACVIM stage B1, B2, C, and D, respectively. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was diagnosed in 526 (23.9%) dogs. Atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in 59 dogs with a prevalence of 2.7%. Univariate analyses showed that mixed breed, male gender, decompensated ACVIM stage, left atrial diameter‐to‐aortic ratio (LA/Ao) &gt; 1.6, normalized left ventricular diastolic diameter &gt; 1.7, and presence of PH were significantly associated with the development of AF. Also the continuous variables LA, body weight (BW), fractional shortening (FS), and velocity of trans‐mitral E wave (E‐max) were significantly different (

LA/Ao (odds ratio [OR] 14.011, 7.463‐26.304), E‐max (OR 2.204, 1.192‐4.076), BW (OR 1.094, 1.058‐1.130), and FS (OR 0.899, 0.865‐0.934); and LA (OR 5.28, 3.377‐8.092), decompensated ACVIM stage (OR 4.922, 1.481‐16.353), and FS (OR 0.919, 0.881‐0.959) were significant predictors of AF for model 1 and 2, respectively. An LA &gt; 3.45 cm had sensitivity and specificity of 98.3% and 89.8% to predict development of AF.
