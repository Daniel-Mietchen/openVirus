<p>The medical databases of three Veterinary Teaching Hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of MMVD after complete cardiovascular assessment (ie., physical examination, thoracic radiography and trans‐thoracic echocardiography) and cardiac rhythm assessment via routine 2 minutes ECG and/or good quality ECG tracing during echocardiographic examination of at least 20 minutes' duration. For dogs with multiple examinations during the observing period only data of the most recent exam were considered. Selected clinical and echocardiographic parameters were compared using univariable and different multivariable logistic regression models.</p>
