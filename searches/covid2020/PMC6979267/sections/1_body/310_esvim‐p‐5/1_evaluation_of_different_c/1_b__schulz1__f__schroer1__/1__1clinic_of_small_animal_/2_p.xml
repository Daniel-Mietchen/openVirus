<p>For that purpose the chambers “RC Chamber” (RC) (Cegla Medizintechnik) (n = 10) and “AeroKat” (AK) (Trudell Medical International) (n = 5) were evaluated. Standardized bacterial contamination was performed using a 
 <italic>Pseudomonas‐aeruginosa‐</italic>suspension that was previously established by serial dilution. Aliquots of 50 mL were applied with a pipette on three pre‐defined locations of the chamber. After 24 hours chambers were cleaned/sterilized according to manufacturers` instructions. For RC this included a cleaning procedure using a special bag in the microwave for 3 minutes at 800 watt (n = 5) or placement in boiling water for 5 minutes (n = 5). AK was placed in lukewarm water with cleaning detergent for 15 minutes (n = 5). After air drying of all chambers swabs were taken from three defined areas of each chamber (mask, valve, chamber), applied on Mueller‐Hinton‐agar, and incubated for 24 hours.
