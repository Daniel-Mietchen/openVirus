<p>Targeted toxins are promising agents designed to target receptors that are uniquely or highly expressed by cancer cells, improving tumor specificity with reduced adverse events (AEs). As their name implies, bispecific ligand‐targeted toxins have dual targeting ability that confers greater binding affinity and killing ability compared to monospecific counterparts. eBAT is a bispecific epidermal growth factor (EGF) angiotoxin developed as a second generation biologic drug to specifically target tumor cells and associated vascular and inflammatory stroma for sarcoma therapy. It consists of human EGF, targeting the EGF receptor (EGFR), human amino terminal transferase (ATF) of urokinase, targeting the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and a genetically modified, de‐immunized 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> exotoxin, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis. We previously reported that eBAT was safe and improved overall survival for dogs with splenic hemangiosarcoma (HSA) in the minimal residual disease setting when added to standard of care (SOC) therapy in a single cycle of three treatments. Studies with 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> exotoxin in humans have suggested that repeat cycles of administration may prolong remissions whereas the optimal timing between administration of targeted toxins and chemotherapy is unclear. The SRCBST‐2 (sarcoma bispecific toxin trial‐2) study described herein was undertaken to prospectively determine if multiple cycles of eBAT at the biologically active dose (50 ug/kg) given intravenously, concomitant with a reduced interval between administration of the targeted toxin and doxorubicin chemotherapy would be well‐tolerated and further improve outcomes of dogs with splenic HSA. Eligibility was expanded to dogs with stage‐3 HSA, provided that macroscopic lesions could be surgically excised. Treatment included three planned cycles of eBAT, each administered on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule starting upon recovery from splenectomy, and continuing one week prior to the 1st, 2nd, and 5th doxorubicin events. The interval between first eBAT (given on day 1) and first doxorubicin was reduced compared to the previous trial using a single cycle of eBAT (with doxorubicin starting on day 8 instead of day 21). Twenty‐five dogs were enrolled; six experienced acute hypotension with two requiring hospitalization. Self‐limiting elevation of ALT was observed in one dog. A survival benefit was not seen in this study: overall survival was comparable to that of a contemporary control group of dogs with stages 1‐3 hemangiosarcoma treated with SOC alone. Repeated dosing cycles of eBAT led to greater incidence and severity of AEs and reduced efficacy as compared to a single cycle of eBAT with delayed commencement of chemotherapy.
