<p>Data from 485 cats (aURTD, n = 152; FLUTD, n = 205; abscesses, n = 128) presented in 2018 were compared with data from 2016 (469 cases). The frequency of antimicrobial prescription decreased from 72% (2016) to 61% (2018; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001); this decline was found at the university clinic (68% to 48%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003) as well as in private practices/clinics (73% to 64%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.010) and in each disease category (aURTD, 72% to 61% 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.030; FLUTD, 56% to 44%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.012; abscesses, 97% to 88%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.008). More specifically, the prescription of critically important 3rd generation cephalosporins decreased (2016, 18%; 2018, 13%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.017). Urine analyses were more frequently performed in private practice/clinic in cats with FLUTD (2016, 26%; 2018, 48%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Despite this, the number of prescriptions in accordance with the guidelines (JS1) did not significantly increase from 2016 to 2018 (aURTD, 25% and 31%; FLUTD, 21% and 28%; abscesses, 18% for both years).
