<p>Cats presented to one university clinic and eight private practices/clinics in 2018 with acute upper respiratory tract disease (aURTD), feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) and abscesses (only in private practices/clinics) were included. Signalment, clinical symptoms, diagnostic work‐up, diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy were assessed and the data compared to published data from cases belonging to the same disease categories presented to the same practice/clinic in 2016 (Schmitt et al., 2019). A justification score was applied to evaluate accordance of prescription with the guidelines (JS1 = complete accordance, JS2 = different dosage/duration, JS3 = different antimicrobial choice, JS4 = antimicrobial use/non‐use in disagreement with the guidelines, JS5 = prudent use not assessable).</p>
