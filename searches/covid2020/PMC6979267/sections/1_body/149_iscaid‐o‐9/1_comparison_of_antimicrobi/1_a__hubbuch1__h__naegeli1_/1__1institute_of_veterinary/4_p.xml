<p>The present study reports a reduction in antimicrobial prescription and use of 3rd generation cephalosporins in cats in Switzerland which coincided with antibiotic stewardship activities including the launch of antibioticscout.ch. However, the adherence to consensus guidelines was still poor. An oral preparation of a non‚Äêpotentiated aminopenicillin for cats was not available in 2018 in Switzerland and could have hampered compliance with the guidelines. Thus, although the present study indicates a trend towards less frequent prescription of antimicrobials in cats, further efforts are necessary to promote antimicrobial stewardship in small animal medicine.</p>
