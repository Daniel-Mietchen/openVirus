<p>Dogs undergoing routine staging of cutaneous/subcutaneous MCT between June 2017 and March 2019 were recruited. Routine staging included bloodwork, urinalysis, fine‐needle aspirate (FNA) of regional LN(s), thoracic radiographs, and abdominal ultrasound with FNA of liver and spleen. Regional LN assessment was completed with CEUS for identification of SLN(s). Premedication with intramuscular chlorpheniramine was administered, and 1‐2 mL of sulfure hexafluoride microbubbles (SonoVue™) was injected around the tumour, followed by a local massage. A resident in training in diagnostic imaging examined with ultrasound the anatomical regions with potential draining LNs recommended by a resident in training in oncology. The injection site was checked following the procedure and before the discharge of the dog, and the owners were recommended to monitor the site for any local reaction for the following couple of days.</p>
