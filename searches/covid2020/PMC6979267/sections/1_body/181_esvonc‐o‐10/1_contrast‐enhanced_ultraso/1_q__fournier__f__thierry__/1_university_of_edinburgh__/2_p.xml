<p>The primary objective of this prospective study was to report the SLN detection rate of CEUS in dogs diagnosed with a cutaneous/subcutaneous MCT. A secondary objective was to assess the safety of this technique. We hypothesised that CEUS will identify at least one SLN in &gt;80% of dogs, and that adverse reactions would occur in &lt;5% of cases.</p>
