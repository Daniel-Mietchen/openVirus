<p>Regional lymph node (LN) assessment is part of the routine staging of canine mast cell tumours (MCTs). However, regional LNs are often determined based on their anatomical location and the draining LN(s) may not be accurately identified. In order to overcome this issue, different techniques of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection have been reported. Contrast‚Äêenhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been described to be a sensitive and specific technique in human patients, but has not been widely used in veterinary medicine.</p>
