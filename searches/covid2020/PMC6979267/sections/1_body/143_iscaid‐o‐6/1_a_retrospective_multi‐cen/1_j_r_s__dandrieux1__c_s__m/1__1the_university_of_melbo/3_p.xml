<p>The data were analysed using survival analysis. The outcome of interest was the length of time (in days) between the date of diagnosis and the date of death or euthanasia due to DA. Factors influencing survival time post diagnosis were quantified using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Here the data were organised into counting process format which allowed us to quantify the effect of each antifungal agent on survival time.</p>
