<p>This prospective, baseline‐controlled, multi‐centre clinical field study evaluated the efficacy of SID administered ProZinc insulin in dogs diagnosed with DM in line with the ALIVE‐criteria. Seven follow‐up visits occurred over an 84‐day period. Between days 28‐42, the veterinarian was permitted to switch to twice‐daily (BID) treatment on the basis of clinical signs, maximum blood glucose (BG) or minimum BG obtained from a 9‐hour BG‐curve. Satisfactory diabetic control was defined as an improvement in ≥1 glycemic laboratory parameter and in ≥1 clinical sign.</p>
