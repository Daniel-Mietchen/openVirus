<p>Thirty dogs were enrolled; 5 withdrew early (n = 2 consent withdrawn, n = 2 compliance, n = 1 lack of improvement). Overall, 76% (19/25) of dogs showed satisfactory diabetic control at day 84; 77% (10/13) of SID treated dogs and 75% (9/12) of BID treated dogs. In treatment‐naïve dogs, satisfactory control was achieved in 91% (10/11; 7 SID, 3 BID) and in insulin pre‐treated dogs in 64% (9/14; 3 SID, 6 BID). At study conclusion, 80% (20/25) showed improvement in ≥1 one clinical sign (PU/PD, body weight). Mean BG decreased from 482 ± 125 to 295 ± 65 mg/dL, minimum BG from 437 ± 140 to 218 ± 84 mg/dL, and fructosamine from 566 ± 119 to 394 ± 83 μmol/L. Clinical hypoglycemia was observed once in two SID treated dogs, which recovered after feeding.</p>
