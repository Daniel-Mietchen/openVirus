<p>Chemotherapy‚Äêinduced diarrhoea (CID) is one of the most frequent adverse events associated with chemotherapy in dogs. Yet, there is currently no consensus regarding its management. Metronidazole is frequently prescribed, however there is no evidence supporting its use, which could actually be associated with concerning gastrointestinal dysbiosis. Diosmectite is a natural medical clay, which is widely used for the treatment of acute diarrhoea in humans. There is strong evidence, both in vivo and in vitro, and in multiple species, supporting the use of diosmectite as an antidiarrheal.</p>
