<p>Dogs diagnosed with non‐gastrointestinal neoplasia and undergoing maximum‐tolerated dose chemotherapy between June 2017 and January 2019 were randomised into 2 groups (“diosmectite” and “standard” groups), and were randomly re‐allocated if they developed another CID event. Diosmectite was administered at 0.5 g/kg/day PO divided in 2‐3 doses to be initiated at the start of CID. “Standard” management consisted of a course of metronidazole at 10‐15 mg/kg PO q12h to be initiated if the diarrhoea was not improved after 48 hours. Dogs were assessed weekly with standard quality of life (QOL) and diarrhoea diary forms filled by the owner, and physical examination performed by the clinician. The Waltham faeces scoring system was used to grade diarrhoea.</p>
