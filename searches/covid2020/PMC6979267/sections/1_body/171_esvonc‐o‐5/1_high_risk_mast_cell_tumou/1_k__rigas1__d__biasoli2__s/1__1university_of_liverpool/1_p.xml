<p>Mast cell tumour (MCT) represents the most common canine skin neoplasia and typically affects adult‐geriatric dogs (median age 9 years). MCTs are rarely reported in puppies and junior dogs, and therefore little information exists about their biologic behaviour and treatment requirements. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe clinical and histopathological features, proliferation markers, c‐kit mutations and outcome of MCTs in dogs less than 1 year‐old.</p>
