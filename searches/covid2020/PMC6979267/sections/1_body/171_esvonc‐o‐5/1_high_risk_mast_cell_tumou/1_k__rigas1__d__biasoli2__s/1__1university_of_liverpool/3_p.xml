<p>The regional lymph nodes were assessed in 13/16 cases by means of cytology or histopathology; metastases were identified in 4 dogs (2 cutaneous, 2 subcutaneous).Ki‐67 was assessed in 10 cases and it was above the cut‐off in 9 (8 cutaneous, 1 subcutaneous MCT).Of the 9 cases screened, a c‐Kit mutation was identified in 6 (all cutaneous, exons 9,11,12). Patients underwent different treatment modalities: surgery +/− corticosteroids(8), surgery + chemotherapy (5) + radiotherapy (2) and radiotherapy/chemotherapy(1). Recurrence was identified in 3 cases after a median time of 632 days (range 15‐730): one patient received only corticosteroids following recurrence (15 days after the initial surgery), achieving complete and durable clinical remission (1013 days); the other 2 dogs received surgery, which was followed by chemotherapy in one case.The median follow‐up time for this cohort of dogs was 1115 days (range 282‐2655). All patients were alive, and with no evidence of MCT at the end of the study period.</p>
