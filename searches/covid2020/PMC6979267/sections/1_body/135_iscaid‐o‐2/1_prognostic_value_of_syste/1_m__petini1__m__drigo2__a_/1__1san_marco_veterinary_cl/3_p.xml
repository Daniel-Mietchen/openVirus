<p>Seventy cats were eligible for the study, 47 (67%) survivors and 23 (33%) nonsurvivors. At presentation, nonsurvivors were significantly (U = 314.5, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005) younger than survivors, while no difference in reproductive status was found. There was a significant difference (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 8.02; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005) in the number of cats fulfilling SIRS criteria between survivors (9/47, 19%) and nonsurvivor (12/23, 52%). SAA concentrations were significantly lower (U = 749, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.009) in survivors (median = 83.3 μg/dL; range, 0.1″‘248.4 μg/dL) compared with nonsurvivors (median = 138.3 μg/dL; range, 3.2″‘235.8 μg/dL). Serum haptoglobin concentrations were significantly lower (t = −3.24, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) in survivors (mean = 136.13 ± 69.80 mg/dL) compared with nonsurvivors (mean = 190.09 ± 55.25 mg/dL), while no difference in serum cholesterol concentrations were found. Finally, serum tT4 concentrations were significantly higher (t = 3.546, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) in survivors (mean = 1.38 ± 0.66 μg/dL) compared with nonsurvivors. In the Cox proportional‐hazards regression model only serum tT4 concentration was significantly associated with survival (HR = 0.26, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.014). The Youden index identified through ROC curve analysis for serum tT4 concentration was 0.82 μg/dL (sensitivity = 73.9%, specificity = 82.9%; AUC = 0.783, 95% CI, 0.668 to 0.873; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001).
