<p>Retrospective cohort study enrolling cats with feline panleukopenia presented between January 2010 and January 2018. Definitive diagnosis of feline panleukopenia required a positive direct ELISA assay on feces and/or a positive PCR on feces and/or blood. According to their survival status at 28‐days from presentation cats were divided into survivors and nonsurvivors. The prognostic importance at presentation of the variables age, sex and reproductive status, presence of SIRS, serum concentrations of SAA, haptoglobin, cholesterol and tT4 (measured on left over serum sample) was investigated univariately and by multivariabile Cox proportional‐hazards regression model
 <bold>.</bold> Finally, ROC curve analysis was used to identify the best cutoff value (Youden index) for discriminating survivors from nonsurvivors for the prognostic variables resulted statistically significant in multivariable analysis. For all analyses the significance was set to α = 0.05.
