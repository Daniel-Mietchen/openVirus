<p>There was a weak positive correlation between height of antibody titre and mean faecal virus load (Spearman 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.3394; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0035). Antibody titres were significantly higher if cats shed FCoV more frequently (Kruskal Wallis test 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0042). Twenty‐two cats were RT‐PCR‐negative in all four faecal samples. Those cats had significantly lower antibody titres than cats shedding continuously (in all four samples) (Dunn's test; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). When analysing FCoV‐shedding cats (shedding at least once), cats that were FCoV RT‐PCR‐positive continuously in all four samples had significantly higher antibody titres (Mann‐Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0026) and significantly higher mean faecal virus loads (Mann‐Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0383) than cats that were FCoV RT‐PCR‐positive in only one, two, or three samples. Eight cats had no detectable antibodies but were shedding FCoV.
