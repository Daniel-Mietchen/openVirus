<p>Renal ET‐1 activity increases with congestive heart failure, but surprisingly, also increases in MMVD before congestion develops. Neither increase is associated with renal injury or is a consequence of a chronic disease state. Renal ET‐1 may mediate pathophysiological cardiovascular‐renal interactions in MMVD that are different to those in isolated CKD and the development of congestive heart failure.</p>
