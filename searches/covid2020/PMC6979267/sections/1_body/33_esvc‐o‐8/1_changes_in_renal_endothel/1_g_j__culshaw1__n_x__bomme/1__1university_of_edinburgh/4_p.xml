<p>There was a marked increase in UET‐1 excretion in dogs with stage C heart disease (0.69,IQR 1.61 pg/mg; n = 11) compared to healthy dogs (0.02 pg/mg, IQR 0.11; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). UET‐1 excretion was also increased in stage B2 heart disease (0.25 pg/mg, IQR 1.70; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03; n = 19) although to a lesser degree. This was predominantly due to increases in dogs with MMVD (0.38 pg/mg, IQR 1.75; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.046; n = 7) rather than those with non‐MMVD cardiac diseases (0.23 pg/mg, IQR 0.91). al increases in UET‐1 in CKD and chronic disease groups were not statistically significant.
