<p>In this pilot study, we compared UET‐1 and cystatin C (a marker of renal injury/dysfunction) concentrations in surplus urine from four groups of dogs presented to the R(D)SVS: healthy (n = 18), chronic kidney disease (CKD; IRIS stages 2‐4; serum creatinine 257 μmol/l, IQR395; n = 11) cardiac disease (ACVIM classification B1‐C; n = 39) and non‐cardiorenal chronic disease (n = 14). Urine was free‐catch and owner‐collected on the morning of appointment. Samples were excluded if they contained active sediment, and were stored at −80°C before batch analysis.</p>
