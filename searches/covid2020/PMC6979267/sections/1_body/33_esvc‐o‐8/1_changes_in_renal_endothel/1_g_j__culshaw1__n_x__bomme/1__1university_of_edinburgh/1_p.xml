<p>Pathways that disrupt the cardiovascular‐renal axis in dogs are incompletely defined. The renal endothelin (ET‐1) system may play a key role because it regulates blood pressure and sodium homeostasis in the kidney, but also mediates vascular dysfunction and pro‐fibrotic/inflammatory changes that increase cardiovascular risk in people. Urinary ET‐1 (UET‐1) is a marker of renal vascular and tubular ET‐1 activity, and so could provide insight into changes in renal ET‐1 signalling that contribute to cardiovascular‐renal interactions in dogs. We hypothesised that renal ET‐1 activity increases in advanced canine chronic cardiac and renal diseases.</p>
