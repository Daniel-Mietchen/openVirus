<p>Case control study with nested retrospective cohort study, including 3 groups of 95 dogs matched for age, breed, and sexual status: dogs with IMHA (group‐1), clinically healthy dogs (group‐2), sick dogs without IMHA (group‐3). Dogs in group‐1 had a HCT &lt; 30% (reference interval [RI], 38.6%” — 54.5%) and positive anti‐erythrocyte membrane antibodies test. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed if dogs had: amylase and lipase concentrations above RI (&gt;1101 mg/dL and &gt; 725 mg/dL, respectively), CRP concentration &gt; 3.0 mg/dL (RI, 0.01 — 0.22), and anorexia and/or vomiting. Frequency of pancreatitis was compared among the 3 groups (fisher exact test). After admission dogs with IMHA with and without pancreatitis had a 7‐day follow‐up. If some of the dogs with IMHA without pancreatitis developed pancreatitis, they switched to the IMHA with pancreatitis group and were followed‐up for 7 days after the pancreatitis event. Free plasma hemoglobin (Hb
 <sub>fp</sub>) for dogs with IMHA with pancreatitis (at the time of pancreatitis diagnosis) and without pancreatitis (at presentation) was calculated (Hb
 <sub>fp</sub> = Hb
 <sub>tot</sub> ‐[RBC x CHCM x MCV]/1000) and compared (Mann‐Whitney test). ROC curve analysis was used to identify the best Hb
 <sub>fp</sub> cutoff value (Youden index) discriminating IMHA dogs with and without pancreatitis. Relative Risk (RR) of developing pancreatitis in dogs with IMHA and Hb
 <sub>fp</sub> concentration ≥ the Youden Index, was calculated. Finally, 7‐day mortality between IMHA dogs with and without pancreatitis was evaluated (chi square test).
