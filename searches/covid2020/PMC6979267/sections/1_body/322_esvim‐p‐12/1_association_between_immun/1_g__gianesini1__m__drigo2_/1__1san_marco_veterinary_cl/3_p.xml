<p>At presentation, frequency of pancreatitis was significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0013) higher in dogs with IMHA (12/95) compared to the controls (0/95 group‐2 and 5/95 group‐3, respectively). During the 7‐day follow‐up period a further 9 dogs with IMHA developed pancreatitis. IMHA dogs with pancreatitis (n = 21) had a significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0067) higher Hb
 <sub>pf</sub> (median = 0.17 g/dL, range, 0.0 — 1.55) compared to the IMHA dogs without pancreatitis (n = 74; median = 0.0 g/dL, range, 0.0 — 2.89). The Youden index for Hb
 <sub>pf</sub> was 0.08 g/dL (sensitivity = 61.9%, specificity = 75.7%; AUC = 0.672, 95%CI, 0.569 — 0.765; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0096). In dogs with IMHA, a Hb
 <sub>pf</sub> concentration ≥ 0.08 g/dL resulted in an increased risk of pancreatitis (RR = 2.54, 95%CI, 1.51 — 4.29). There was no difference in mortality (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.211) between IMHA dogs with (8/21) and without (18/74) pancreatitis.
