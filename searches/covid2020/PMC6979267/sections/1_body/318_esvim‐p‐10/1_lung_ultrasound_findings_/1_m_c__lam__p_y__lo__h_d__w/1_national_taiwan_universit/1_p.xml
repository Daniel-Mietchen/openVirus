<p>Lung ultrasound (LUS) can be used to detect comet‐tail artifacts (B lines) in animals with trauma, pulmonary edema or alveolar‐interstitial syndrome. The scanning protocols used in previous studies include four anatomic sites on each hemithorax (Vet BLUE) and scanning for all intercostal spaces. The regionally based protocol has the advantage of quickly assessing critically ill patients in respiratory distress; however, it is unclear how the results from Vet BLUE protocol correlate with the findings from entire thorax scanning (ETS). The present study aimed to compare the frequency and numbers of B lines, as well as other parenchymal abnormalities, between the Vet BLUE and ETS protocols. We hypothesized that B lines would be more frequently detected by ETS but not significantly affect the final conclusion.</p>
