<p>Thirty‐four dogs with various clinical problems (16 with cardiac disease, 12 with cardiorespiratory comorbidities, 5 with respiratory disease, and 1 with non‐cardiorespiratory problem) were recruited in this prospective study. Dogs that were uncooperative or too critically ill to tolerate the two scanning protocols were excluded. All scans were performed by a single clinician who had completed an LUS training session. The thorax of each dog was first scanned by the Vet BLUE protocol and then by ETS without hair clipping.</p>
