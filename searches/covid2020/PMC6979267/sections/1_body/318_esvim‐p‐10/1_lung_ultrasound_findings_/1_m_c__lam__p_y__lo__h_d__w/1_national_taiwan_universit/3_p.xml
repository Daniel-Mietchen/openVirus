<p>Compared with the Vet BLUE protocol, B lines were significantly more frequent in ETS (26.5% vs. 50.0%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004). Assessment of the severity of B lines (absent, rare, numerous, or confluent) showed more severity in ETS than that of B lines by the Vet BLUE protocol (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Nevertheless, when a final conclusion was drawn based on ≥2 positive sites (&gt;3 B lines) per hemithorax as used in the previous studies, the final conclusions of the two protocols were not significantly different (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.25), and agreement between the two protocols was substantial (kappa = 0.72). The detection of other parenchymal lesions by the two protocols was not significantly different (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.5).
