<p>Dietary fat composition has been shown to modulate fecal microbiota composition and impact host health. High‐fat diets have been linked to reduced fecal microbial diversity, increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, and low‐grade systemic (LPS) inflammation. While high‐fat diets may modulate the fecal microbiota, there is no data available on the impact of high‐fat diets on the canine mucosal microbiota. The aim of the study was to investigate changes in composition of the mucosal microbiota and serum metabolome in Beagle dogs fed two rations varying in their content of dietary fat.</p>
