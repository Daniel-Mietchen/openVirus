<p>Eight healthy adult Beagle dogs were fed a control diet (13% fat), followed by low‐carbohydrate diet (1% starch) containing either 32% fat (T1) or 46.5% fat (T2) for 2 weeks each in randomized order. Endoscopic biopsies of the small and large intestines and sera were collected for analysis of mucosal microbiota and metabolomic profiles, respectively, before and during dietary intervention. Fluorescence 
 <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) using a 4‐probe array (ie, total bacteria, Firmicutes [
 <italic>Clostridium</italic> cluster XIVa], Bacteroides‐Prevotella and Enterobacteriaceae) quantified colonic mucosal bacteria into distinct compartments. Serum metabolomic profiles resulting from the different diets were quantified by a targeted approach to analyze samples using mass spectrometry and the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p400 HR Kit. Metabolite changes between diets were analyzed by PCA, PLS‐DA, HCA and univariate statistics. 
 <italic>P</italic> values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.
