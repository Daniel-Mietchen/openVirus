<p>Analysis by FISH showed that most mucosal bacteria (EUB‐338) were located within the adherent mucus. There was no difference in the total number and spatial distribution of bacteria within the mucosa of dogs fed control diet versus T1. For the different bacterial groups, sub‐populations of 
 <italic>Clostridium spp</italic>. were significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) increased in adherent mucus of dogs fed T2 versus T1. Changes in mucosal bacteria were accompanied by altered serum metabolomes of dogs fed either T1 or T2. Perturbations in lipid metabolism predominated and primarily involved different glycerophospholipids (GPL), including the phosphatidylcholines (PC) and acylcarnitines (AC). Most GPLs were significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduced in dogs fed T2 but not T1 when compared to control ration. Conversely, T2 also resulted in lower (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) concentrations of other lipid metabolites and select amino acids.
