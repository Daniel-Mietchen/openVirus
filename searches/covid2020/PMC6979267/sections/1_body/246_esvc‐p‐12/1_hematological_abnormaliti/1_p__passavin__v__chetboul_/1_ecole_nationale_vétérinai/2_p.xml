<p>The study sample consisted of 56 dogs (median age = 1.6 year [interquartile range (IQR) = 0.7‐4.0 years], male‐to‐female ratio = 1.5). The most commonly recruited breeds were French Bulldogs (n = 13), White Swiss Shepherds (n = 6), English Bulldogs (n = 4), Boxers (n = 4), Golden retriever (n = 3), Chihuahua (n = 2), and 24 other breeds (n = 1 for each). Among the study population, 44 dogs (79%) had PS and 12 (21%) had AS. The median maximal ∆P values were 161 mmHg [110‐215 mmHg] and 144 mmHg [IQR = 125‐176 mmHg] for PS and AS, respectively. Included dogs showed 1 (34/56), 2 (16/56) or 3 (6/56) obstructive lesions: subvalvular stenosis for 24/56 dogs (13/44 with PS, 11/12 with AS), valvular stenosis for 42/56 dogs (37/44 with PS, 5/12 with AS), and supravalvular stenosis for 16/56 dog (only PS).</p>
