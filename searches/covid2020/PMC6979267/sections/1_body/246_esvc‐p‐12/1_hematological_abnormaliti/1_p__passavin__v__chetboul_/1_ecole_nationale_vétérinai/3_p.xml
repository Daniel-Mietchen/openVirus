<p>Hematological abnormalities were detected in most dogs (n = 49; 88%), with schizocytes found in 28/56 (50%) dogs (median proportion = 1‰ cells [IQR = 0‐3‰]), acanthocytes in 46/56 (82%) dogs (median proportion = 45‰ cells [IQR = 10‐226‰]), and hemolytic anemia in 4 dogs with PS (hemoglobinemia &lt;12.4 g/dL). No significant association was identified between these abnormalities and the above‐mentioned echocardiographic parameters. Three out of the 4 dogs with hemolytic anemia had a maximal ∆
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 200 mmHg (242 to 412 mmHg). Interestingly, the dog with the highest maximal ∆P also had the most severe anemia and schizocytosis, and both abnormalities decreased, and then resolved, after balloon valvuloplasty.
