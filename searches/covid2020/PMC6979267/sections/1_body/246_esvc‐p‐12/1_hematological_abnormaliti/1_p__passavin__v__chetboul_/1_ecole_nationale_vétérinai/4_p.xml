<p>In conclusion, these results show that red blood cell abnormalities (acanthocytosis and schizocytosis) are very common in dogs with congenital arterial stenosis, thus suggesting that turbulent blood flows through stenotic orifices induce mechanical erythrocyte damage. Further prospective studies are needed to better document these findings and elucidate the precise mechanisms of red cell damage using other hematolytic markers (eg, lactate dehydrogenase, hemosiderinuria, etc.), as performed in human patients.</p>
