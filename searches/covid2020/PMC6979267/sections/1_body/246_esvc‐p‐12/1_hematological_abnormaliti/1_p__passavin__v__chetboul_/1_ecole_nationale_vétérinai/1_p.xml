<p>Intravascular hemolysis has been identified in human patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. The underlying mechanism implies shear stress exerted on erythrocytes by high velocity flows through the stenotic orifice. No similar data are currently available in veterinary medicine. The aim of this prospective study was therefore to 1) document hematological abnormalities in dogs with arterial stenosis (ie, aortic stenosis [AS], pulmonic stenosis [PS]) between 2017 and 2019 and 2) evaluate if maximal and mean Doppler‐derived trans‐stenotic pressure gradients (∆P), as well as features of stenotic lesions (number and location), were associated with erythrocyte abnormalities.</p>
