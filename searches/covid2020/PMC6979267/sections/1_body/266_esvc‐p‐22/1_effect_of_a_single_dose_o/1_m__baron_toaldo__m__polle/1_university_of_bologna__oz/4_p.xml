<p>Among the tested variables, some differed before and after pimobendan administration. In particular heart rate (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002), RV FS (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.011), RV fractional area change (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.010), and tissue Doppler imaging derived tricuspid annulus systolic wave velocity (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.014) increased significantly. On the other side, RV internal diameter in diastole (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.019) and systole (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002), and RA maximal (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004) and minimal (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) diameters were reduced after pimobendan administration.
