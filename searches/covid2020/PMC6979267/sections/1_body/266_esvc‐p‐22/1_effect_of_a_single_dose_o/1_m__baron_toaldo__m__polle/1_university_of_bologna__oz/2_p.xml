<p>Eleven apparently healthy cats were used for this study. Cats were deemed to be healthy on the basis of clinical examination, cardiac auscultation, non‐invasive blood pressure measurement, blood work, and conventional echocardiography (including RV wall thickness in diastole, RV internal diameters in diastole and systole from a short axis view, RV fractional shortening (FS), RV areas in diastole and systole from an apical view, fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, tissue Doppler imaging derived tricuspid annulus systolic wave velocity, RA maximal and minimal diameters, and RA FS). Cats were scanned following standard techniques while gently manually restrained. Each cat was scanned a total of eight times, at different time points in two subsequent days. The first day cats were scanned at time 0, and after 1, 3, and 6 hours. The following day, each cat received an echocardiography before (time 0), and 1, 3, and 6 hours after a single dose of 1.25 mg of pimobendan administered orally.</p>
