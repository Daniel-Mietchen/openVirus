<p>C‐reactive protein (CRP) is a well‐known acute phase protein in dogs. It has been recently shown to be particularly useful in discriminating bacterial bronchopneumonia from other pulmonary diseases and promising in guiding antibiotic therapy duration. However, in those publications, dogs infected by 
 <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic>(Bb) have not been specifically distinguished from others. In an experimental study, high elevations of CRP have been identified in dogs inoculated with Bb. Nevertheless, the amplitude of increase of CRP in naturally‐infected dogs with Bb has not been described.
