<p>Median age of dogs with Bb infection and ABP were 0.6 and 5 years respectively (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Eleven dogs with Bb infection had alveolar lesions on radiographs with only one out of 11 dogs having another bacterial coinfection. CRP value was mildly elevated in 11/11 dogs and 1/5 dogs with and without alveolar lesions, respectively (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and the median CRP value was significantly higher in dogs with alveolar lesions compared with dogs without alveolar lesions (20 mg/L, [14‐38], versus 5 mg/L, [5‐11], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Duration of clinical signs was longer than 2 weeks for all Bb dogs; duration was not different between dogs with normal or elevated value as well as between dogs with or without alveolar lesions. In dogs with Bb infection and alveolar lesions, median CRP value was significantly lower than in dogs with ABP (17 versus 118 mg/L, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and ranges of elevation of CRP did not overlap between these two groups ([15‐38 mg/L] and [55‐270 mg/L] respectively).
