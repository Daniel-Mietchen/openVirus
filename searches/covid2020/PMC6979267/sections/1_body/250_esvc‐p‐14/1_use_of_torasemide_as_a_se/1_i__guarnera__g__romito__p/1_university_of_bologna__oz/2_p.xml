<p>Medical database of our Teaching Hospital has been reviewed searching for dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease who experienced CHF and received torasemide as a second line diuretic after treatment failure with furosemide (study group: 25 dogs). Clinical, echocardiographic, radiographic and laboratory findings have been annotated. Survival time has also been reported and calculated from the first episode of CHF. A control group (23 dogs) of dogs with similar cardiac disease, that never received torasemide has also been selected. Data were collected at the time of first CHF (first examination) and in concomitance with the last examination available.</p>
