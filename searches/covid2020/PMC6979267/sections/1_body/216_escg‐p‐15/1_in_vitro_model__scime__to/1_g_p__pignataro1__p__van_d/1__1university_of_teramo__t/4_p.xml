<p>Different effects on the composition of the canine intestinal microflora during the experiment time were promoted. Among 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, the results obtained highlighted the ability to a significant increase (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0,005)in the amount of 
 <italic>Acidaminococcaceae (OTU 0022:0.8 ± 0.9% at lumen level)</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterococcaceae (P &lt; 0,0005)</italic>. The 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> displayed a decrease (P &lt; 0,05) in species that belong to the family of 
 <italic>Bacteroidaceae (OTU 0002:5.2 ± 0.2% at lumen level)</italic>. In addition, there is a significant growth (P &lt; 0,05) in the family of 
 <italic>Coriobacteriacaee</italic>. The 
 <italic>Akkermansiaceae</italic> family 
 <italic>(OTU 0010:4.2 ± 0.4% at lumen level)</italic> is absent in the inoculum but there is a little increase during the experiment
 <italic>. Enterobacteriaceae (OTU 0008:23.2% ± 0.4)</italic> recorded a significant increase (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
