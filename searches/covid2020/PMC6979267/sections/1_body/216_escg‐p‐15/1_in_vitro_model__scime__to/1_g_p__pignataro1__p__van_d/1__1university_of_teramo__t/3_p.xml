<p>Fresh faeces collected from four healthy dogs were inoculated in the SCIME system, the experiment lasted 14 days and was conducted in duplicate by giving two different types of feeds to each donor. Model validation was evaluated through analysis of microbial activity by the quantification of SCFA, lactate, and ammonium. The composition of the colonic microbiota was studied through qPCR using primers targeting the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, and Enterobacteriaceae and through 16S‐targeted Illuminates sequencing of the total bacterial population.</p>
