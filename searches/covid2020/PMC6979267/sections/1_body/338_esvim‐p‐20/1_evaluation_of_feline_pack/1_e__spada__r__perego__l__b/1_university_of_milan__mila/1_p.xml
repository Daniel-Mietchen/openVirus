<p>Component therapy involves separation of whole blood (WB) into its components (packed red blood cells ‐PRBCs‐ and plasma), for specific replacement therapy and to reduce transfusion reactions. In cats, blood for transfusion is commonly collected using an open system and administered as WB, in part because of the challenge of preparing components from a small blood volume. Feline blood has a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate; therefore, if the syringe containing collected blood is placed upright, plasma can be removed from the red cells shortly after collection for separate storage of plasma and PRBCs. The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics of feline PRBC units obtained by blood sedimentation both at collection and after storage for 42 days.</p>
