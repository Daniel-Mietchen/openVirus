<p>Blood was collected from fourteen feline blood donors into three 20 mL syringes pre‐charged with CPDA‐1:blood ratio of 1:7 using an open system. A pre‐donation CBC was performed in each donor. The three syringes were allowed to sediment for approx. 1 hour at room temperature. Then plasma was aseptically expressed into plain transfer bags and RBC expressed into another transfer bag pre‐charged with 10 mL of SAG‐M. PRBCs units were stored in a blood‐dedicated refrigerator and sampled using blood bag segments at preparation time (D0) and after 42 days storage (D42). On pre‐donation blood and on PRBC units at D0 and D42 the following parameters were evaluated: I) hematological parameters (RBC, Hb, Hct, WBC, PLT); II) percentage hemolysis; III) morphological index (only for PRBC units), scored of 0 to 3 based on echinocyte transformation of the normal discocyte; IV) aerobic and anaerobic blood culture (only for PRBC units).</p>
