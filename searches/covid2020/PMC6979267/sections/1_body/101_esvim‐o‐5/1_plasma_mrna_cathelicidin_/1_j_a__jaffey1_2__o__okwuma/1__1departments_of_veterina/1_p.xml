<p>Cathelicidin is an antimicrobial peptide essential to the innate immune system and whose circulating concentrations are well documented to have a positive association with 25‚Äêhydroxyvitamin (OH) D in people. Decreased 25(OH)D concentrations are predictive of survival in people and dogs with critical illness. Decreased production of cathelicidin has been proposed to be an important mechanism linking decreased 25(OH)D concentrations with survival in critically ill people. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between plasma cathelicidin mRNA expression and serum 25(OH)D concentration and survival in critically ill dogs.</p>
