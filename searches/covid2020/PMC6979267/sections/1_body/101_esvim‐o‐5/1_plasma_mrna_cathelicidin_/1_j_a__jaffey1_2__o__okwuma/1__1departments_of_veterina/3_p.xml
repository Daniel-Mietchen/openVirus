<p>There was not a significant difference in cathelicidin concentrations between dogs with sepsis (mean, SD; 8.29, 0.47), critically ill without sepsis (8.90, 0.82), and healthy controls (8.52, 0.62; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.32; one‐way ANOVA). There was not a significant correlation between 25(OH)D and cathelicidin expression (rs = −0.14, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.55; spearman correlation). Thirty‐three percent (4/12) of critically ill dogs did not survive to discharge. Cathelicidin concentrations were not predictive of survival to discharge (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.64; logistic regression). Dogs with sepsis (mean, SD; 26.1 ng/ml, 9.2, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), and critically ill dogs without sepsis (18.7 ng/mL, 9.4, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) had significantly decreased serum 25(OH)D compared to healthy controls (53.9 ng/ml, 15.7, one‐way ANOVA). Severity of illness defined by APPLEfast scores (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.22), serum 25(OH)D concentration (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.25), and presence of sepsis (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.42; logistic regression) were not predictive of survival.
