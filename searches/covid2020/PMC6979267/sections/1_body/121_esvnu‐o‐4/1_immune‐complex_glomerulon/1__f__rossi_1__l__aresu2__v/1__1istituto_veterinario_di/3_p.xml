<p>Sixty‐eight cats were included, 37 (54.4%) with ICGN and 31 (45.6%) with non‐ICGN. In cats affected by ICGN, 18 (48.6%) had MGN, 14 (37.8%) membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and 5 (13.5%) mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. Breed, sex, age, FIV and FeLV status, creatinine, UPC ratio and SBP were not different among morphological diagnoses. In cats with non‐ICGN, 11 (35.5%) had end‐stage CKD, 9 (29%) focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, 6 (19.4%) global mesangiosclerosis, 2 glomerular atrophy and renal dysplasia (6.5%) and 1 (3.1%) amyloidosis. Eight (25.8%) cats with non‐ICGN had grade 1 tubulointerstitial damage, 13 (41.9%) grade 2 and 10 (32.3%) grade 3; creatinine and UPC ratio were positively associated with grades (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and had higher mean UPC ratio (7 ± 3.2 vs. 3.6 ± 2.3;
