<p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has typically a non‐immune mediated origin in cats and immune‐complex glomerulonephritis (ICGN) has been scarcely described.

Therefore, aims of this study were to characterize morphological diagnoses of ICGN by light and electron microscopy in a large cohort of cats and to identify associations with clinical and laboratory findings. Additionally, comparisons were performed with cats affected by non immune‐complex glomerulonephritis (non‐ICGN).</p>
