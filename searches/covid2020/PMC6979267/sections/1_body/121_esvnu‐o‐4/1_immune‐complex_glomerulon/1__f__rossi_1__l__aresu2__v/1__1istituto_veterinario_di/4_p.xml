<p>In conclusion, MGN and MPGN were the two most common morphological diagnoses of ICGN in cats, but clinical and laboratory findings did not allow their differentiation. In cats with non‐ICGN, serum creatinine concentration and UPC ratio were associated with the degree of tubulointerstitial damage confirming previous literature. Cats with retrovirus infections, higher UPC ratio and younger age were more likely affected by ICGN than non‐ICGN.</p>
