<p>Renal biopsies of cats with ICGN and non‐ICGN examined between 2010 and 2019 were considered if both light and electron microscopy were available. Data collected for analysis included breed, sex, age, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) status, serum creatinine concentration, urine protein‐to‐creatinine (UPC) ratio and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Differences between morphological diagnoses of ICGN and non‐ICGN, including tubulointerstitial damage score, were investigated with Kruskal‐Wallis and chi‐squared tests. The likelihood of diagnosing ICGN versus non‐ICGN was explored with logistic regression.</p>
