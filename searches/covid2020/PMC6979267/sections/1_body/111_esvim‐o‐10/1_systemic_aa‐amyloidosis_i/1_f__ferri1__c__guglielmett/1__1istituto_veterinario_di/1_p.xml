<p>Systemic AA‐amyloidosis is a protein misfolding disease of humans and animals arising from the formation of amyloid fibrils from the acute phase protein serum amyloid A. In animals it is common in chickens and cheetahs kept in captivity. Latest studies showed that transmission of systemic AA‐amyloidosis occurs in cheetahs and involves fecal shedding of amyloid fibrils. Client‐owned domestic shorthair cats are rarely affected by systemic AA‐amyloidosis. Whether systemic AA‐amyloidosis is common in domestic shorthair cats living in shelters and shedding of amyloid fibrils occurs is unknown. Thus, aims of the study were to determine the frequency of systemic AA‐amyloidosis in different cat shelters and to investigate excretion of amyloid fibrils.</p>
