<p>In conclusion, the prevalence of systemic AA‐amyloidosis appears to be elevated in shelter cats and shedding of amyloid fibrils occurs in the bile. Cats with systemic AA‐amyloidosis are more likely to shed higher amounts of AA‐amyloid. Whether bile excretion of AA‐amyloid indicates that horizontal transmission is relevant to the disease in shelter cats remains undefined.</p>
