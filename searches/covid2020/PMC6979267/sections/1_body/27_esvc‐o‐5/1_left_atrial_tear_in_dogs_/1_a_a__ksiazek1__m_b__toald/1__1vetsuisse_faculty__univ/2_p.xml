<p>Data were collected from the veterinary cardiology departments' databases, selecting patients with advanced MMVD associated LAT. Signalment, clinical presentation, echocardiography, selected laboratory findings, the cause of death and survival data were evaluated. Parameters were assessed upon LAT diagnosis (time 0, T0) and at the resolution of pericardial effusion (time 1, T1). Control dogs with similarly advanced MMVD were selected based on quantitative echocardiographic parameters matching those of LAT dogs at T1.</p>
