<p>Thirty client‐owned dogs were included: 15 dogs with MMVD associated LAT and 15 control dogs without LAT. In both groups, 9 dogs were in ACVIM congestive heart failure stage C and 6 in B2 MMVD. Commonly observed clinical signs included dyspnoea, syncope and weakness. No significant differences were found in age (both groups 10 ± 2 years, 
 <italic>P = 0.89</italic>), body weight (both groups 7 ± 5 kg, 
 <italic>P &gt; 0.99</italic>), gender distribution (LAT group: 7 females, control group: 10 females, 
 <italic>P = 0.46</italic>), serum creatinine concentration (LAT group: 131 umol/L ± 72, control group: 108 umol/L ± 39, 
 <italic>P = 0.42</italic>) or echocardiographic variables between the groups. Mean left atrial to aortic diameter ratio was 2.24 ± 0.4 at T0, 2.53 ± 0.4 at T1 for dogs with LAT and 2.26 ± 0.4 for the controls. Left ventricular internal diameter normalized to body weight at end diastole was 1.15 ± 0.3 at T0, 1.29 ± 0.2 at T1 for dogs with LAT and 1.25 ± 0.3 for the controls. Pericardiocentesis was performed in 3/15 dogs
 <bold>.</bold> At study termination, all dogs in LAT and 10 in the control group had died from cardiac causes. Five dogs with LAT had died in the first week post admission as compared to 1 control dog
 <bold>.</bold> The mean survival time for LAT dogs was 53 days. When excluding the animals that died in the first week, survival times were 427 for dogs with LAT and 371 days for the control dogs (
