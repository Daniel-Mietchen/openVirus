<p>Clinical records of apparently healthy cats with dynamic right‐sided systolic heart murmurs that underwent echocardiography between 2010 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Only cats that had blood flow turbulence in the infundibular tract induced by provocative testing during image acquisition of the right parasternal short axis view at the level of the heart base and did not have functional or structural abnormalities during echocardiographic examination were included in this study (n = 61). Their median age was 8.0 (6.0 to 9.3) years and mean body weight was 4.5 ± 1.22 Kg. The median murmur grade was 2/6.</p>
