<p>The study was carried out on six dogs with a presumptive diagnosis of a focal liver lesion. A clinical examination, laboratory blood tests and abdominal ultrasound were carried out prior to MRI. The animals were examined using a 1.5‐Ingenia Philips MRI system. The imaging protocol consisted of breath triggered pre‐contrast T1, T2 and post‐contrast T1 weighted sequences performed in transverse plane. Gd‐EOB‐DTPA was administered intravenously at 0.1 mL/kg, followed by 15 mL of a 0.9% saline solution. The post‐contrast T1‐W sequences were acquired 26 minutes after contrast administration. Samples for histopathological examination were collected from all the cases (surgical resection ‐ 1 case, core‐needle biopsy ‐ 4 cases, necropsy ‐ 1 case).</p>
