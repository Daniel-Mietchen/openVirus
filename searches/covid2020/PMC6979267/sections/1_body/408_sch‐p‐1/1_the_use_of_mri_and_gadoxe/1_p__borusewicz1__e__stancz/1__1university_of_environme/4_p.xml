<p>Parenchymal liver metastasis was found in one case. The lesion was strongly hypointense compared to the surrounding liver tissue in both pre‐contrast sequences and no signal‐enhancement following contrast administration was observed. Focal nodular hyperplasia was observed in one case. It was isointense compared to the surrounding liver tissue in pre‐contrast sequences, and it showed signal‐enhancement post contrast, similar to that observed in the surrounding healthy tissue. A non‐enhancing central scar was observed within this lesion. A hepatocellular adenoma was diagnosed in two cases. The lesions were T1‐W hypointense and T2‐W hyperintense on pre‐contrast images compared with the surrounding liver tissue. In both cases, contrast enhanced MRI of the lesions were observed. In one case, a hepatic carcinoid was found in the liver parenchyma. The tumour was weakly hypointense in T1‐W pre‐contrast sequences, while it was weakly hyperintense with a strongly hyperintense centre in T2‐W images. No contrast enhancement was noted. A hepatocellular carcinoma was also diagnosed in one case. This lesion was heterogenous in pre‐contrast sequences, with moderate T1‐W hypointensity and moderate T2‐W hyperintensity. It did not show contrast enhancement and remained strongly hypointense compared to the surrounding tissue.</p>
