<p>Regional wall motion abnormalities affecting various myocardial segments (left ventricular free wall (4/11), apex (4/11) and interventricular septum (3/11)) were observed at the first exam in 8/13 or at follow‐up visits in 9/10 dogs. Abnormal segments appeared thin and hyperechoic in 7/10 dogs during follow‐up echocardiograms. Systolic dysfunction was observed in 9/13 dogs (5/13 at presentation and 4/10 at follow‐up). Three dogs did not survive to discharge. Postmortem exam was performed in 2 dogs, showing severe extensive myocardial necrosis and hemorrhage and/or replacement of myocardial tissue by fibrous tissue on histopathology.</p>
