<p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the most common cause of human ischemic heart disease. Its pathogenesis involves atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, platelet activation, thrombosis and vasospasms. Only anecdotal information on canine AMI exists. Postmortem descriptions of arteriosclerosis with myocardial ischemic injury and congestive heart failure are available, but clinical data regarding ante‚Äêmortem diagnosis of AMI is lacking. This case series describes possible predisposing factors, clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings in dogs with a presumptive diagnosis of myocardial infarction.</p>
