<p>The database of 4 veterinary clinics were retrospectively screened for dogs with a presumptive diagnosis of AMI. Suspicion was based on echocardiographic regional wall motion abnormalities (hypokinesia, akinesia or dyskinesia at initial presentation or follow‚Äêup), and/or elevated serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), without any other obvious cause. Thirteen dogs with a presumptive diagnosis of AMI were identified. History, clinical data, cTnI, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings were reviewed. Data are expressed as median and range.</p>
