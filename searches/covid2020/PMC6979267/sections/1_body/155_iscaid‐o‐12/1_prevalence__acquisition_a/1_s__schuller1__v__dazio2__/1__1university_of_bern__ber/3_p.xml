<p>The overall admission prevalence of MDRO carriage was 15.5% (95%CI 11.4‐20.4) with ESBL‐producing 
 <italic>E.coli (</italic>5.5%) and MRCoNS (8.5%) predominating. The overall discharge prevalence was 32.6% (95%CI 26‐39.8; range 17.2‐42.7%). In the institution with the highest discharge prevalence predominant hospital‐acquired isolates were: ESBL‐producing 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (13.7%) and ESBL‐producing 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> (16.7%). 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> isolates commonly displayed CP‐encoding genes 
 <italic>(bla</italic>
 <sub>oxa‐181,</sub>
 <italic>bla</italic>
 <sub>oxa‐48,</sub>
 <italic>bla</italic>
 <sub>NDM‐5</sub>) and showed clonality (ST410, 
 <italic>bla</italic>
 <sub>oxa181</sub>), suggesting transmission from a common source rather than 
 <italic>de novo</italic> selection. Persistence of ESBL‐producing or CP 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> or 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was shown in 7/34 MDRO positive animals for up to 138 days. Resistant bacteria were isolated from 10/46 owners (6/10 ESBL‐producing 
 <italic>E.coli</italic>; 3/10 MRCoNS; 2/10 MRSA); carriage persisted in one owner for 68 days. Transfer of ESBL‐producing 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> between owner and dog was suspected in one case. Further analysis is ongoing to determine the relatedness of the isolates.
