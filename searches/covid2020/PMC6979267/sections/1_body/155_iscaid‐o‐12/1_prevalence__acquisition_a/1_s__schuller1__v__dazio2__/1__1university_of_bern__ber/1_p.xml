<p>Multidrug‐resistant organisms (MDRO) represent a significant threat to human and animal health. Extended‐spectrum β‐lactamase (ESBL), extended‐spectrum cephalosporinase (3CG) and carbapenemase‐producing (CP) 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> are of particular importance as their easily transmitted resistance genes mediate resistance to many antimicrobial classes. The aims of this study were: to assess the prevalence of MDRO carriage in dogs and cats at presentation to veterinary clinics/practices, to monitor MDRO acquisition during hospitalization, to study MDRO transmission among pets and owners and to determine the duration of carriage.
