<p>For this prospective, longitudinal, observational study, rectal and nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 88 cats and 183 dogs presented to 5 veterinary care facilities and 187/271 animals were resampled at discharge. Participating owners sampled themselves (nasal swab/stool sample). Carriers were resampled for up to 8 months. Nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were analysed for the presence of methicillin‐resistant (MR) 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), MR 
 <italic>S. pseudintermedius</italic> (MRSP), MR coagulase‐negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), MR 
 <italic>Macrococcus</italic> spp. and rectal swabs/stool for ESBL‐producing and CP 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. After enrichment, isolates were selected on CHROMID ESBL, OXA‐48 and CARBA plates or MRSA selective agar. Isolates were identified via MALDI‐TOF MS. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by measurement of MICs and clonality determined using rep‐PCR, ERIC‐PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS).
