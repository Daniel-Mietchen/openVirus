<p>In this cohort, the acquisition rate of 3CG‚Äêresistant and/or CP 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> was high, but varied between institutions. MDRO carriage was observed in 22% of owners and carriage persisted for several months. These findings show that veterinary hospitals play a significant role in the selection and transmission of MDRO amongst veterinary patients, including bacteria with very problematic resistance profiles.
