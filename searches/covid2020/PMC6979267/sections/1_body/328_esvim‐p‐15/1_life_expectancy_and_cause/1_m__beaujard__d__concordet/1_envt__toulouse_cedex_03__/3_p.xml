<p>The database of the TVTH was searched for dogs recorded dead between September 2007 and 2017. Their records were screened to determine the age at death and classify its cause between neoplastic, cardiovascular, behavioral, dermatological, endocrinological, gastroenterological, hematopoietic, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurological, ophthalmological, reproductive, respiratory, trauma, age‐related and uronephrological causes. Breed and weight category (&lt; 10, 10‐25, 25‐45 and &gt; 45 kg) were recorded if specified. Results were analyzed using commercial software (R® and Excel®). Log rank test was used for life expectancy; the effect of breed, gender, reproductive status and weight category was assessed by Khi2 test and multivariate analysis.</p>
