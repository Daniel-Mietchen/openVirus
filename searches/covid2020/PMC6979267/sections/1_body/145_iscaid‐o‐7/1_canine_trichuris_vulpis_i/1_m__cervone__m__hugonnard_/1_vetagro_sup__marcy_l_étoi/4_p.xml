<p>Forty‐nine dogs were positive for 
 <italic>Tv</italic> on fecal analysis and 45 were included in the study (25 dogs in G1 and 20 dogs in G2). In G2, concurrent isolated parasites were 
 <italic>Toxocara canis</italic> (47,8%), Ankylostomatidae (43,5%), 
 <italic>Capillaria</italic> spp (13%), Tænidae (4,3%), 
 <italic>Isospora</italic> spp (34,8%) and 
 <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> (21,7%). The median age of infected dogs was 4 years. Overall, clinical signs included diarrhea (49%), weight loss (38%), hematochezia (29%), inappetence (24%), vomiting (18%) and polyphagia (13%). Intussusception was diagnosed in 2 dogs, only in G1. Two dogs showed lethargy as the only clinical sign, likely due to a moderate to severe anemia. Digestive signs were acute (less than 10 days) in 34% of dogs and chronic in the remaining dogs. Biological abnormalities included anemia (23%), eosinophilia (30%), hypoalbuminemia (60%) and Na/K ratio &lt; 24 with normal ACTH‐stimulation test (12%). Four percent of dogs had neither clinical nor biological signs. The only difference between G1 and G2 was that weight loss was more frequent in G2 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). No significant association was found between clinical signs or biological abnormalities and FE. However, a Na/K ratio &lt; 24 with normal ACTH‐stimulation test was only found among dogs with massive FE. Complete recovery after antiparasitic treatment was obtained in 94% of dogs with available follow‐up (n = 18). One dog died of intussusception.
