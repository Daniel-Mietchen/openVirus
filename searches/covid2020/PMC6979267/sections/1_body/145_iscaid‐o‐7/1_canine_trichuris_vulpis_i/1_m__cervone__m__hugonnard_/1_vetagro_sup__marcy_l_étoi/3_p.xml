<p>Our medical database was searched for cases with 
 <italic>Tv</italic> eggs identified on fecal analysis between 2002 and 2018. Dogs were classified as mono‐infected by T
 <italic>v</italic> (G1) or poly‐infected (
 <italic>Tv</italic> and other parasitic species; G2) and the intensity of 
 <italic>Tv</italic> fecal excretion (FE) was quantified (number of 
 <italic>Tv</italic> eggs/5 g of feces). Dogs diagnosed with other comorbidities potentially contributing to systemic or digestive signs, or to biological abnormalities such as anemia or hypoalbuminemia, were excluded. Clinical signs, biological abnormalities and course of the disease were recorded and compared between groups. Associations between these variables and the FE were statistically evaluated and the level of significance was set at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.
