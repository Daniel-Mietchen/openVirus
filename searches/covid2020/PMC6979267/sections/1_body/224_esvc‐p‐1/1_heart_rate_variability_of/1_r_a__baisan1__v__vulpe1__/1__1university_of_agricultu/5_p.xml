<p>This study shows that in dogs with aclinical MVD, both sympathetic and parasympathetic tones might remain unchanged until only after clinical signs have developed, despite the presence of structural remodeling. The onset of clinical signs is likely to trigger an ANS imbalance due to both sympathetic tone activation and vagal tone withdrawal. Moreover, SDNN, which is an independent marker for risk of mortality, may be the only HRV‚Äêrelated parameter able to distinguish between aclinical dogs with and without cardiomegaly.</p>
