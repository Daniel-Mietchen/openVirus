<p>A significant decrease in time domain parameters was shown in Group C when compared to Groups N, B1 and B2. These parameters included the SD of all normal intervals (SDNN) 
 <italic>(P &lt; 0.05)</italic>, the root‐mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats (rMSSD) 
 <italic>(P &lt; 0.01),</italic> and the percentage of adjacent normal intervals that differ from each other by more than 50 ms (pNN50) 
 <italic>(P &lt; 0.01)</italic>.
