<p>Seventy‐four client‐owned dogs with echocardiographically confirmed MVD were retrospectively divided into three groups according to the 2009 ACVIM Consensus Statement: B1 (n = 20), B2 (n = 20) and C (n = 34). A control group, labeled N (n = 21) included healthy normal dogs. All dogs received physical examination, five‐minute‐long six‐lead electrocardiography (ECG), complete echocardiography, thoracic radiography and bloodwork. Short‐term heart rate variability was evaluated using the time and frequency domains from the five‐minute‐long ECG recordings.</p>
