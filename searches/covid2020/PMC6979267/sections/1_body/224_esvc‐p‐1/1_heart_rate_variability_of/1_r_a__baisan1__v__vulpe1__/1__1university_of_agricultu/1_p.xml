<p>Hemodynamic changes associated with mitral valve degeneration (MVD) activate neurohumoral mechanisms, to maintain adequate cardiac output and capillary perfusion pressure. A predominant sympathetic and/or a diminished vagal tone are linked to disease progression. Only scarce information about autonomic nervous system (ANS) dynamics during MVD progression is available in the veterinary literature. To our knowledge, the ANS imbalance in dogs with MVD prior to receiving cardiac pharmacotherapy has not been evaluated. We sought to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) for assessing the ANS activity in dogs with preclinical and yet untreated clinical MVD.</p>
