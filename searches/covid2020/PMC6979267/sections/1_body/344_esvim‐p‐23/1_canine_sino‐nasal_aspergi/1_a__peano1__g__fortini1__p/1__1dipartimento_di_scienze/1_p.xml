<p>Sino‐nasal aspergillosis (SNA) is an important cause of chronic nasal disease in the dog, characterized by the formation of a superficial mucosal fungal plaque within the nasal cavity and/or frontal sinus of systemically healthy dogs. 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> is classically recognized as the most important etiological agent. Notably, this species is now considered a “group” (the Fumigati group) including several species distinguishable only via molecular exams. To date, few studies have analyzed fungal isolates involved in canine SNA cases at genetic level, showing that 
 <italic>A. fumigatus sensu stricto</italic> was the main causal species. On the opposite, other species of the Fumigati group (the so called criptic species of the viridinutans complex) have been found associated to SNA in cats (in cats SNA is more invasive and has a poor prognosis, due to the involvement of the retro‐orbital space). The aim of this study was to described the clinical and mycological features of a series of 38 cases of canine SNA in Italy. Cases were recruited by veterinarians belonging to ENDOVET (a group specialized in endoscopy). The diagnosis was achieved by a combination of exams (endoscopic visualization of fungal plaques and/or visualization of fungal elements at cytology/histology of nasal biopsies). Fungi were isolated from biopsies and identified by morphological keys and molecular analyses (sequencing of the ß‐tubulin gene). Twenty isolates chosen randomly were tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against some antifungal agents commonly used in the dog with SNA (itraconazole, clotrimazole, enilconazole) and other agents more used in human patients (voriconazole, posaconazole).
 <italic>A.fumigatus</italic> sensu stricto was identified in most of the cases (34/38, 89%), with the remaining cases due to 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium spp. and Paecilomyces spp</italic>. (for one case a definitive identification was not achieved). 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) values were within expected limits, therefore resistance was not detected. A breed predisposition was not noted. On the contrary, in agreement with some past studies, a sex predisposition could be noted, since males accounted for 66% of the sample. Clinical signs more frequently observed are those already reported in the literature (eg. nasal discharge was present in 100% of the cases, it was monolateral in 82%). Frontal sinus involvement was confirmed in 47% of cases. Although data on follow up visits were incomplete, the most effective treatment seemed to be represented by mechanical debridement of fungal plaques plus local treatment using clotrimazole cream or enilconazole solution (procedures conducted during endoscopy).
