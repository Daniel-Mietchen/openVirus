<p>We conducted a prospective multicentre study. Dogs with HC on treatment with trilostane twice daily for at least two weeks were blood sampled and categorized as unwell (sick or over‐treated dogs), well and under controlled (no dose or dose increase required dogs, respectively) based on the CS. The results of the CS were compared with: serum cortisol concentration pre‐trilostane (T0), 3 h‐post‐trilostane (T3) and 4 h‐post‐trilostane (1 h‐post‐ACTH) (T4) administration, plasma ACTH concentration pre‐trilostane administration, plasma ACTH/cortisol (T0) ratio, serum haptoglobin concentration (Hp), chemistry variables (ALP, ALT, GGT), urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio and urine specific gravity (from urine of the evaluation's day and from the morning of the day before). Plasma ACTH and serum and urinary cortisol were measured with a chemilumescent assay (Immulite 2000)., 76 re‐evaluations of 37 dogs were included. Unwell dogs were excluded for further analysis. Haptoglobin was the parameter that better correlated with the CS (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.47), followed by ALT (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.34), T0 (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.33) and the UCCR average of the 2 urinary samples(
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.33). ROC curve analysis identified a concentration of Hp of 150 mg/dl and a concentration of T0 of 4 μg/dl as useful value to discriminate well and under controlled dogs with a specificity of 91% and 78% respectively.
