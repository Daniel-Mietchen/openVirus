<p>Hp seems to be the best parameter to monitor trilostane therapy. However, Hp has likely limited capability to identify over‐treated dogs; the concurrent evaluation of cortisol pre‐trilostane may be useful in detecting an overdose of trilostane. The combined evaluation of Hp and T0 correctly categorized 85% of the cases and can be used as alternative monitoring method for dogs with HC under trilostane therapy.</p>
