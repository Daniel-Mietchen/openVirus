<p>The monitoring of trilostane treatment, the drug of choice for the medical therapy of canine hypercortisolism (HC), is currently based on the evaluation of the clinical signs and the results of the ACTH stimulation test. However, this method has many limitations and recent data have shown a lack of correlation between ACTH stimulation test results and the clinical signs of dogs with HC treated with trilostane. Over the last years, many different studies investigated possible alternative methods with conflicting results. A single study to compare all these methods in the same canine population is lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate which of the previous investigated monitoring methods better correlate with a standardized and published clinical score (CS) obtained by an owner questionnaire and could represent the best method to monitor trilostane therapy.</p>
