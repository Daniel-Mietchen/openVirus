<p>The overall percentage of cases diagnosed with ‘atypical’ hypoadrenocorticism may be higher than previous estimates. The percentage of newly diagnosed cases of hypoadrenocorticism at referral practice which have ‘atypical’ disease appears higher than the percentage of ‘atypical’ cases diagnosed at first opinion practice. In the absence of electrolyte abnormalities classically associated with ‘typical’ cases of hypoadrenocorticism, particularly a Na:K ratio &lt; 27, the index of suspicion for the disease may be low. The finding of a higher percentage of patients with ‘atypical’ disease when considering the population diagnosed at referral practice raises concern that cases may go undiagnosed at first opinion practice.</p>
