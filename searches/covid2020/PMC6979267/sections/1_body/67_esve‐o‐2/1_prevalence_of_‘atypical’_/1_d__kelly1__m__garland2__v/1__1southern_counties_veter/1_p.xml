<p>A diagnosis of ‘Atypical’ Addison's disease is typically made in patients diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism with a Na:K ratio &gt; 27 at presentation. The percentage of patients with hypoadrenocorticism which have ‘atypical’ disease remains unknown. The primary aim of this study was to determine the percentage of dogs diagnosed with atypical disease within a general population of dogs diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism and to determine if this percentage differed between a population diagnosed in first opinion practice and a population diagnosed at referral practice.</p>
