<p>The database of a commercial laboratory in the United Kingdom was searched to find dogs diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism over a four year period (2015‐2018). Dogs were included if an ACTH stimulation test was performed and post ACTH cortisol concentration was &lt;55 mmol/L. The results of serum or plasma sodium and potassium concentrations at the time of initial presentation were also required for inclusion. Dogs were excluded if they were receiving trilostane or any other medication known or expected to interfere with adrenal function testing. Dogs were diagnosed with ‘atypical’ hypoadrenocorticism if the Na:K ratio at the time of presentation was &gt;27.</p>
