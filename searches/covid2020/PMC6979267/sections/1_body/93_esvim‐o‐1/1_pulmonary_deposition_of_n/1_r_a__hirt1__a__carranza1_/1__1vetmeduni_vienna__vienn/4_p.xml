<p>On both occasions dogs inhaled a dose of nebulized 
 <sup>99m</sup>technetium‐diethylenetriamine‐pentaacetic acid (
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc‐DTPA) through an Aerochamber® Medium attached to a customized nose‐muzzle mask for 3 minutes. Immediately afterwards dogs were scanned with planar scintigraphy in right lateral, left lateral and sternal recumbency. The deposition of 
 <sup>99m</sup>Tc‐DTPA in the head region, the lungs, the stomach, as well as the whole body distribution were recorded and quantified by manual or isocontour region of interest (ROI) analysis. Deposition calculated as percentage of delivered dose in the ROI was compared. The distribution of deposition within the lungs was scored independently by 3 blinded observers for the degree of asymmetry between right and left lung (0‐2) and patchiness (0‐2) of individual images as well as possible differences in the scan image pairs (ie. before and after airway narrowing; 0‐2) in random order. For analysis, individual scores were averaged.
