<p>All cases boarded the cabin. Thirty‐five patients were able to return home (2 dogs without surgery). Two dogs developed events related to mitral valve disease (1 left atrium rupture and 1 pulmonary edema, respectively). The dog with left atrial rupture died before surgery and she did not receive cardiac medications during the flight. The dog that developed pulmonary edema post‐flight also missed a dose during the journey, but responded to medical therapy after the landing. Both of the dogs were in ACVIM classification stage D. About 20% of cases showed changes in physical condition (exercise intolerance, appetite) before and after flight. None of the changes required treatment. Two dogs showed gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea) before flight. Three patients developed diarrhea after the flight. Among patients who showed respiratory symptoms before and after flight, 38% showed respiratory distress and 19% showed worseing in coughing. There were 5 dogs with syncopal episodes before the flight; however, none of the dogs fainted after the flight. One dog had post‐flight syncope..</p>
