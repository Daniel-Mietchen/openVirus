<p>A caliper was prepared on which the length and the IBW appeared simultaneously. The ideal body weight on the caliper was the weight corresponding to either a body fat percentage of 20% or 25%. The length between the sternal process and the sciatic process was measured by clinical veterinarians using caliper. Ten dogs that visited the animal hospital were used. The veterinarians were asked to assess how the IBW determined by the callipers differed from that of the IBW based on their experience.</p>
