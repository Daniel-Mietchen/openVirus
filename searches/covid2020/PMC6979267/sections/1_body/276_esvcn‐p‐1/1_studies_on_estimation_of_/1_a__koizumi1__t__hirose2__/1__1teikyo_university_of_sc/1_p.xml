<p>Accurate clinical nutritional assessment by body condition scoring in dogs is not easy because of subjective method. Therefore, to make an objective nutritional assessment, we examined a morphometric method. As a result, a high correlation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.945) occurred between the length from the sternal process to the sciatic process and the ideal body weight (IBW). In this studies, we present a caliper that can estimate the IBW by measuring the length by applying this finding.
