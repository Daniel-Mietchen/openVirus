<p>The present study showed that TTKG, in hyperkalemic patients can be used as a diagnostic tool in the initial discrimination of dogs with Addison disease, from hyperkalemic dogs without Addison disease. In a subset of hyperkalemic dogs, TTKG may be helpful in patient management until confirmatory diagnosis with an ACTH stimulation test is available.</p>
