<p>Addison disease is characterized by a deficiency of both cortisol and aldosterone. The lack of aldosterone results in renal sodium wasting and potassium retention leading to hyponatriemia, hyperkalemia and a body volume depletion. The effect of aldosterone on serum potassium excretion can be evaluated by comparing urine and serum potassium concentrations after correcting the urine potassium concentration for reabsorption of solute‚Äêfree water by the kidney. This estimation has been called TTKG. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of TTKG in the identification of dogs affected by Addison disease among a population of hyperkalemic dogs.</p>
