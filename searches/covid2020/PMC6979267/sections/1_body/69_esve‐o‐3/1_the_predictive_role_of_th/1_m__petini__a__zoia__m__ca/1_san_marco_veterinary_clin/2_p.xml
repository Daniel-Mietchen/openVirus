<p>For this cross‐sectional study, we retrospectively search the data base for dogs with a serum potassium concentration &gt; 5.5 mmol/L (reference interval = 3.9‐5.1) presented between December 2012 and February 2019. Inclusion criteria were a urine TTKG calculated at hospital admission (which is routinely done in our laboratory) and a final diagnosis available. Based on final diagnosis dogs were divided in newly diagnosed, naturally‐occurring Addison's disease (diagnosed by an ACTH stimulation test) and other diseases. Dogs were excluded from the study if they had an history of corticosteroid administration and/or drugs having affecting potassium excretion (e.g., ace‐inhibitors, aldosterone‐receptor blockers, diuretics, fludrocortisone, IV fluids). Moreover, hyperkalemic dogs were also excluded if urine osmolality was ≤300 mOsm/Kg or urine sodium was ≤25 mmol/L, precluding these values a correct TTKG calculation. TTKG was compared by T‐test between dogs with Addison disease and sick hyperkalemic controls dogs. Finally, ROC curve analysis was used to identify the best cutoff value (Youden index) for discriminating dogs with Addison disease from sick hyperkalemic controls dogs without Addison disease. For all analyses the significance was set to α = 0.05.</p>
