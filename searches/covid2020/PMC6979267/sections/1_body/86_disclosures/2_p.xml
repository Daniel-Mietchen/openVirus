<p>All authors are members of the Canine Diabetes Genetics Partnership, which is supported by Dechra Veterinary Products (providing financial support for members' travel to CDGP meetings three times a year, and acting as the industrial partner in a PhD studentship for Alice Denyer). The CDGP is funded by the PetPlan Charitable Trust, and this funding paid for the whole genome sequencing as well as the salary of the author (not attending the congress) and bioinformatician Marsha Wallace. Brian Catchpole also receives funding for a PhD student (unrelated to this project) from MSD Animal Health. Lucy Davison (Senior Author and presenter) is funded by the UK Medical Research Council and also has funding from BSAVA PetSavers for work unrelated to this abstract. She is also already entitled to free registration to the meeting as Chair of the ECVIM exam committee and wants to disclose that she is Vice‚Äêpresident of ESVE and cannot be involved in abstract review. We would be happy to provide any further details on request. Other authors (CDGP members) are involved in a wide variety of other research projects at their respective institutions, across a large number of fields with numerous funding sources. None of their funding sources have access or potential to gain from the data presented here. No CDGP members receive any salary or consultancy fee for their role in the CDGP and none stand to make any direct financial gain from the data in this abstract. All authors have seen the information presented in this abstract and have been given the opportunity to comment on it. In the interests of full disclosure, please note that a preliminary findings abstract on Whole Genome Sequencing in canine diabetes (submitted by the Canine Diabetes Genetics Partnership) has been accepted for poster presentation at the Canine and Feline Genetics and Genomics meeting in Bern 2019. However the ECVIM abstract submitted here is based on screening variants against a larger data set, so uses data from additional dogs and breeds. It also includes bioinformatics improvements, allowing better quantification and annotation of candidate genetics variants.</p>
