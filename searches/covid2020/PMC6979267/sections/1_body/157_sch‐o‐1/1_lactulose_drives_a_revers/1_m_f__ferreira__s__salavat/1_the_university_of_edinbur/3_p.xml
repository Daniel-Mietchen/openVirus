<p>After 2â€‰weeks of lactulose treatment (week 7) significantly lower faecal microbiota richness/diversity was observed based on the alpha diversity metrics: observed operational taxonomic units, Shannon/ Chao1 indexes and Pielou's evenness. Beta diversity, based on UniFrac distances, was also significantly different in week 7 compared to weeks 1, 5 and 9. At the bacterial phylum and family levels, week 7 was associated with a significant increase of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria (
 <italic>Veillonellaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic>), and decrease of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria (
 <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusobacteriaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Alcaligenaceae</italic>), when compared to weeks 5 and 9. Finally, an extrapolated cirrhosis dysbiosis ratio (CDR) was calculated, for which lower values are associated with dysbiosis and linked with worse outcomes in humans. CDR was increased in week 7 compared to weeks 1, 5 and 9.
