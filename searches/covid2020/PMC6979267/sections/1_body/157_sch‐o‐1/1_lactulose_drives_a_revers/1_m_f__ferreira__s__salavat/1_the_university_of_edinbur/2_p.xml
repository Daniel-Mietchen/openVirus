<p>A total of 21 healthy privately owned dogs were enrolled in a prospective cohort study (12 females, 9 males, median age 5 years [range 2‐10]) with 18 completing the study fully. Faecal samples were collected weekly, while dogs were either on their usual diet (week 1), followed by a standardised commercial diet (weeks 2‐9), with added oral lactulose (0.5 mL/kg every 12 hours) in weeks 6‐7. Faecal bacterial DNA extraction was followed by PCR amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Illumina standard 16S library prep and sequencing was performed on the MiSeq platform and data analysed using the QIIME2™ pipeline.</p>
