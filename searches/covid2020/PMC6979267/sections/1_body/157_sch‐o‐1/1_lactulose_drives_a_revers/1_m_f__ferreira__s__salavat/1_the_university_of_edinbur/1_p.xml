<p>Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a syndrome of neurologic dysfunction and an important contributor to patient morbidity in dogs with liver diseases. The prebiotic lactulose, a nonabsorbable synthetic disaccharide, is a frequently employed treatment for canine HE, yet with incompletely understood mechanisms of action. In humans, HE is linked with dysbiosis, which has been associated with worsened morbidity and mortality. The impact of lactulose in ameliorating this HE‚Äêassociated dysbiosis or general modulation of the intestinal microbiota is controversial. It is unknown if dysbiosis is present in canine HE and the influence of lactulose on the intestinal microbiota has also not been assessed in dogs. The aims of this study were therefore to examine the changes in faecal microbiota composition before, during and after lactulose treatment in healthy dogs.</p>
