<p>Fifteen FB (7 BOAS, 3F/4M, 8 asymptomatic, 8F) and 10 Pugs (7 BOAS, 2F/5M, 3 asymptomatic, 3F) underwent complete echocardiographic examination of the left and right heart according to guidelines. In each breed, echocardiographic parameters of dogs with clinical signs of BOAS were compared to asymptomatic dogs. Furthermore, BOAS FBs were compared to BOAS Pugs. Weight‐depended variables were indexed (variable/weight
 <sup>1/3</sup>). Normally distributed variables were compared with independent 
 <italic>t</italic>‐test and for not normally distributed data Mann‐Whitney test was used. Statistical significance was defined as 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.1.
