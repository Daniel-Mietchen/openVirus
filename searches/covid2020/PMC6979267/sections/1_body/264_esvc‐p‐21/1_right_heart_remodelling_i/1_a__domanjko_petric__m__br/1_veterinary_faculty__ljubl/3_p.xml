<p>There were no significant differences in age and weight between BOAS FB and asymptomatic FB. BOAS FB had significantly lower vena cava collapsibility index (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.013), larger right ventricular internal diameter in mid cavity (RVIDmid) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.056), larger indexed RVIDmid (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.098), higher tricuspid valve (TV) E wave velocity (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.083), and lower peak systolic tricuspid annular velocity (St) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.037) compared to asymptomatic FB. There were no statistical differences between asymptomatic and BOAS Pugs in age, weight and echocardiographic parameters. No significant difference in weight between FB and Pugs was found; however BOAS FBs were younger (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.067). BOAS FBs comparing to BOAS Pugs showed lower collapsibility index (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002), larger indexed right ventricular longitudinal internal diameter (RVIDlong) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.084), larger indexed right ventricular area (RVA) in diastole (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.022), larger indexed RVA in systole (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.027), larger indexed right atrial area (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.023), larger indexed LVIDd (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.048), higher mitral annular plane excursion (MAPSE) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.011), higher mitral valve (MV) E velocity (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.013), higher MV A wave (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.084), higher TV A (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.099) and higher peak systolic annular velocity of left free wall Em (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.047).
