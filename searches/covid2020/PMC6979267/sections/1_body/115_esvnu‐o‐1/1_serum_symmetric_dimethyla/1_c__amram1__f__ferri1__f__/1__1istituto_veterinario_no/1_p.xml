<p>Serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) concentration has been shown to be a marker of renal dysfunction in dogs and cats. In humans, dialysis lowers SDMA but less efficiently than urea because the former has a larger distribution volume. Information concerning SDMA in animals undergoing extracorporeal renal replacement therapy is yet lacking. The aim of this study was to describe the dynamic of SDMA concentration in dogs and cats with acute kidney injury treated with intermittent hemofiltration (IHF).</p>
