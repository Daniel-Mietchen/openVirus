<p>Reports of IHF performed between October 2017 and 2018 were collected. Medical records were reviewed and cases with pre‐ and post‐IHF biochemical profiles were included. IHF was performed according to standard methods. Urea, creatinine and SDMA reduction‐ratio (URR, CreaRR, SDMARR) was calculated for each IHF. In dogs and cats separately, first sessions of IHF were included in group A, second sessions in group B and third sessions in group C. URR, CreaRR and SDMARR were compared within each group with non‐parametric tests.</p>
