<p>Overall, 39 IHF sessions were performed in 14 dogs and 8 cats; specifically, 13 dogs and 8 cats in group A, 9 dogs and 5 cats in group B, 3 dogs and 1 cat in group C. Five (35.7%) dogs and 3 (37.5%) cats survived. Median SDMA concentration pre‐IHF was 62 μg/dl in dogs (range: 15‐ &gt; 100) and 78 μg/dl in cats (range: 41‐ &gt; 100). In dogs, median values of URR, CreaRR and SDMARR were 37.1% (range: 12.0‐66.3), 35.6% (range: 12.0‐67.7) and 16.7% (range: −86.7‐42.6), respectively; in cats, their median values were 38.6% (range: 20.4‐52.4), 41.5% (range: 21.2‐54.1) and 33.8% (range: 7.1‐50.0). In 8 of 25 (32%) IHF sessions in dogs, SDMARR was either negative (n = 5) or 0 (n = 3). These 8 sessions were performed in 6 dogs: 4 had leptospirosis and 2 poisoning (grape and ethylene glycol), 4 died. The median SDMARR was lower than URR in groups A and B in dogs (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.021, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.008) and not different in cats. In group A in dogs, SDMARR was also lower than CreaRR (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007). No other differences were observed in both species.
