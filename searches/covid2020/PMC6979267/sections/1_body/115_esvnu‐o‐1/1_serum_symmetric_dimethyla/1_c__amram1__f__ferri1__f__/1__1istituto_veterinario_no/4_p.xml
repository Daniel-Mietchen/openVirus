<p>In conclusion, SDMARR did not represent an accurate marker to assess efficiency of IHF in dogs. The partial inability of IHF to clear SDMA, the large distribution volume of SDMA or other unknown conditions affecting post‚ÄêIHF SDMA concentration might have contributed to this result. Differently, SDMARR may be reliable to evaluate IHF efficiency in cats.</p>
