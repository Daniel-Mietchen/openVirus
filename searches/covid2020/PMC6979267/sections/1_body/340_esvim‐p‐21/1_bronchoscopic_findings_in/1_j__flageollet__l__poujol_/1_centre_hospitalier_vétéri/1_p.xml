<p>Vegetal foreign bodies are a frequent cause of cough in dogs during spring and summer in France. They can result in a variety of other clinical signs and endoscopic abnormalities. The aim of this study was to describe the foreign body location, rate of retrieval success, complications, and macroscopic endoscopic findings in dogs with vegetal foreign bodies. Fifty two dogs were included in this retrospective evaluation from the medical records of dogs admitted between 2010 and 2019 for a bronchial vegetal foreign body. Diagnosis was based on direct visualisation during the bronchoscopic exam or after surgical retrieval.</p>
