<p>First, reference intervals (RIs) for RETIC‐HGB and CHr were established analysing 59 healthy non‐anaemic cats. Second, 275 cats were classified as having ILE or not. Low plasma iron or low transferrin saturation (%TfS) in combination with either anaemia and/or altered red blood cell (RBC) indices was required for diagnosis of ILE. Haematologic variables, parameters of iron metabolism as well as serum amyloid A were compared between both groups and correlation between RETIC‐HGB and CHr was assessed.</p>
