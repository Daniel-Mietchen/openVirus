<p>RIs for RETIC‐HGB and CHr were 12.5‐18.0 pg and 14.0‐19.9 pg, respectively. In respect of iron and haematologic variables, 20/275 cats (7.3%) were classified as ILE cats. Compared to non‐ILE cats, ILE cats had significantly lower median values of RETIC‐HGB and CHr. Not unexpectedly, HCT, HGB, MCH, and RBC were significantly decreased in ILE cats. Additionally, ILE cats had significantly increased median SAA values. Correlation between RETIC‐HGB and CHr was moderate (r
 <sub>s</sub> = 0.59) with a small bias of −1.2 pg.
