<p>The study population consisted in 160 CKCs either healthy or affected by DMVD (median weight = 9.15 kg [interquartile range (IQR) = 7.8‐10.3], male‐to‐female ratio = 0.95). According to the ACVIM classification, 28/160 dogs (17.5%) had no identifiable DMVD lesions (stage A), 86/160 (53.8%) and 22/160 (13.8%) were in stages B1 and B2, respectively, 23/160 (14.3%) had past or current congestive heart failure (CHF, stage C), and 1/160 (0.6%) had refractory CHF (stage D). Dogs for which mitral regurgitation (MR) was adequate for quantification by the Proximal Isovelocity Surface Area method (n = 107) had a median regurgitation fraction (RF) of 38% [23‐55].</p>
