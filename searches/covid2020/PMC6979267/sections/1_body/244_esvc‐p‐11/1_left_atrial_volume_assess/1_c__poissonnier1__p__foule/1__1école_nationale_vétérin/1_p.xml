<p>Degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) is the most common acquired heart disease in small‐sized dogs with a high predisposition of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKC) breed. Echocardiographic assessment of the disease is based on the evaluation of atrial and ventricular dimensions, with left atrial (LA) diameter measurement being one of the strongest predictors of clinical outcome. The LA diameter is usually evaluated on the right parasternal transaortic short‐axis view and compared to the aortic (Ao) diameter (LA:Ao ratio). However, LA dilation can develop in medio‐lateral, cranio‐caudal, or ventro‐dorsal directions. Therefore, the LA:Ao ratio may not be reliable for the early detection of LA dilation. Measurements of LA volumes have been recently recommended in the dog using monoplane and biplane Simpson's modified methods of discs (SMOD) and area‐length methods (ALM). The objectives of this prospective study were therefore to 1) compare different echocardiographic methods in evaluating LA volume in a large population of CKCs and 2) to assess LA volume according to DMVD severity.</p>
