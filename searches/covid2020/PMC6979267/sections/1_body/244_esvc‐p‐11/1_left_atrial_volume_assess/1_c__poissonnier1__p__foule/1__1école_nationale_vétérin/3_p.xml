<p>The monoplane SMOD and ALM using the left apical 4‐chamber view overestimated LA volume by comparison with the biplane ALM (+2.6% and + 10.8%, respectively), and the monoplane ALM overestimated LA volume in comparison with the monoplane SMOD (+8.3%). Left atrial volumes significantly increased with ACVIM stages. Among B1 dogs, end‐systolic LA volume assessed by the biplane ALM was significantly lower in dogs with mild MR (RF &lt; 30%, median volume = 0.75 mL/kg [IQR = 0.59‐0.90]) than for dogs with higher MR (RF≥30%, median volume = 1.39 mL/kg [IQR = 0.96‐1.56];
