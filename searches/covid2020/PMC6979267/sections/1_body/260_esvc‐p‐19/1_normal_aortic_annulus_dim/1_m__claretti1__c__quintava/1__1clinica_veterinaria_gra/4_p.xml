<p>Cardiovascular screening conducted between 12/11/1999 and 09/03/2018 were included. Two‐dimensional, M‐Mode, spectral and color flow Doppler transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is performed following the published recommendations. Sixteen dogs were excluded from the analysis due to the lack of data on sex and 119 for the annulus less than 15 mm, remaining for the analysis a sample of 4066 dogs. These dogs have been divided into males and females and into weight quartiles. Subsequently the normal values and confidence intervals for annulus were analysed for the entire sample, by gender, by weight quartiles and by sex and weight interaction.</p>
