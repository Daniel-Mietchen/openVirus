<p>The medical databases of two Veterinary Teaching Hospitals were reviewed searching for dogs with MMVD that developed AF during the following year (study group). The last echocardiographic examination obtained during sinus rhythm was used to derive selected variables used for successive statistical comparison. For each dog with AF a control dog, matched for body weight (BW), class of heart failure, and LA dimension as expressed by the ratio between LA and aortic diameters (LA:Ao), but never developing AF over a comparable follow up period was selected. All echocardiographic exams were reviewed by a single board certified cardiologist and several variables of LV and LA dimension and function, and LA volumes were obtained. In particular LV internal diameters in diastole and systole were obtained as absolute values and indexed to BW. LA dimensions were expressed as absolute value and LA:Ao, moreover LA volumes were measured during maximal and minimal LA expansion and at the peak of the P wave, and then indexed to BW. Several indexes of LA function were then calculated from these volumes. Peak trans‚Äêmitral E and A waves velocities, E:A ratio, and A wave duration were also measured. LA speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) was carried out and peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS), peak atrial contraction strain, and contraction strain index were measured.</p>
