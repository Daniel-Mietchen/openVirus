<p>Forty‐four dogs with MMVD were included, 22 dogs developing AF and 22 dogs maintaining a sinus rhythm. There was no difference in terms of BW (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.803), sex distribution (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.393), and class of heart failure (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.550). Among the tested echocardiographic variables only LA diameter (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.034), and LV internal diameter in diastole not indexed for BW (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.031) differed significantly between groups. There was no difference in terms of LA:Ao (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.097), LV internal diameters in diastole and systole indexed for BW (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.131 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.406, respectively), and LA volumes and volume‐derived functional parameters. Among the STE‐derived variables, PALS values differed significantly between AF group (mean value 23.8 ± 8.6) and control group (mean value 30.5 ± 9.6) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.027).
