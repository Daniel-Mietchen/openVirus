<p>Methemoglobin forms when hemoglobin iron is oxidized from ferrous iron (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) to ferric iron (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>), which is incapable of binding O
 <sub>2</sub>. Hereditary methemoglobinemia in dogs is most commonly caused by cytochrome b
 <sub>5</sub> reductase (CYB5R) deficiency. We recently reported on 2 likely‚Äêcausal 
 <italic>CYB5R3</italic> variants in 1 dog. Scattered case reports show varied clinical consequences of hereditary methemoglobinemia in dogs. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the metabolic and molecular bases and characterize clinicopathological features of canine CYB5R deficiency.
