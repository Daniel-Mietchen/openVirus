<p>Twenty‐five dogs from various breeds were investigated for unexplained mild to severe non‐cardiopulmonary cyanosis. EDTA blood was used to determine methemoglobin concentrations (methb%) and CYB5R enzyme activities, and analyze 
 <italic>CYB5R3</italic> gene for disease‐causing mutations. The previously documented nonsynonymous Ile190Leu 
 <italic>CYB5R3</italic> variant was homozygous in 16 of the dogs and heterozygous in 3 dogs. The other previously identified variant was not found in any other dogs. Whole genome sequencing analysis identified 2 novel nonsynonymous 
 <italic>CYB5R3</italic> variants: Arg219Pro (homozygous in 7 dogs) and Thr202Ala (homozygous in 1 dog).
