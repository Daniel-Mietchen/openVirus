<p>In conclusion, this study reveals the clinical, metabolic, and molecular genetic variation seen in CYB5R deficiency in dogs. The Arg219Pro variant appeared to cause a more severe phenotype than the Ile190Leu variant. The 4 DNA variants identified can been readily used as genetic screening tests.</p>
