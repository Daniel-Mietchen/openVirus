<p>The rise in antibiotic resistance amongst urinary tract infections (UTIs) in both cats and dogs underscores the need for non‐antibiotic approaches to UTIs. The probiotic 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Nissle‐1917 (EcN) has many benefits including antimicrobial activity against many human pathogens including uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC). The aim of this study was to phylogenetically characterize UPEC in feline UTI cases and investigate the in vitro susceptibility of these isolates to EcN.
