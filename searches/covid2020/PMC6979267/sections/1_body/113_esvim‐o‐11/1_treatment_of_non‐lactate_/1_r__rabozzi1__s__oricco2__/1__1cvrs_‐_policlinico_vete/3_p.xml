<p>This prospective, multicenter, randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety was authorized from the Ethical Committee. Hospitalized dogs with an excess of bases ≤ −10 mEq/L were enrolled in the study if the baseline lactate level was not greater than 4 mEq/L. Patients were classified by ultrasonographic methods as hypovolemic or normovolemic and randomized with random number generation in the type of fluid to be received (Ringer's Lactate in the RL group and Hyper‐SID in the H‐SID group). Normovolemic and hypovolemic dogs received 4 hours infusion at the rate of 4 or 10 mL kg
 <sup>−1</sup> hr
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively. Blood gas analysis, before fluid infusion (T0) and after 4 hours (T4), were compared for the following parameters: Be‐ecf, pH, PCO2, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Lactate, SID
 <sup>3</sup>, SID
 <sup>4</sup>. After normality distribution analysis, variables were described and evaluated using non‐parametric statistics (significance level set to 5%).
