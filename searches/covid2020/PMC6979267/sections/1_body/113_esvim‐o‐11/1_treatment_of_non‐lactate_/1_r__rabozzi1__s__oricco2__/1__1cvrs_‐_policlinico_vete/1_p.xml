<p>The use of sodium bicarbonate‐based solutions for treating metabolic acidosis is currently debated. The alkalizing effect of solutions with elevated Strong Ion Difference (SID) has recently been described. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a chloride‐free iso‐osmolar solution with elevated SID (Hyper‐SID), compared to Ringer's lactate used for the treatment of metabolic acidosis.</p>
