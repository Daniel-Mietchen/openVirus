<p>Forty dogs were included in the analysis, median age was 110 months (12‐192) and median weight 16 kg (3‐39). Dogs classified as hypovolemic were 9/40 in the RL group and 13/40 in H‐SID group, while dogs classified as normovolemic were 8/40 in the RL group and 10/40 in the H‐SID group. The basal Be‐ecf was not different between the treatment groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). In normovolemic patients the median increase in Be‐ecf at T4 in the RL and H‐SID group was 0.8 mEq/L and 4.5 mEq/L (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004) respectively, whereas in hypovolemic patients was respectively of 1.3 mEq/L and 11,5 mEq/L (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001). Lactate value greater than 5 mEq/L was not documented in any patient during the study.
