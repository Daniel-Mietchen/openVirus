<p>Results showed that the bacterial load was higher in EB dogs (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The AMOVA results indicated differences between EB group compared with S and T groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.005). Significant differences in relative abundances at the family and the genus level were found. The genus 
 <italic>Hydrogenophilus</italic> was higher in EB and the genera 
 <italic>Brochothrix</italic>, 
 <italic>Limnohabitans</italic>, 
 <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> and 
 <italic>Curvibacter</italic> were higher in WHWT compared with other groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In each group, specific genera were found as indicators of discrimination (p &lt; 0.05). Bacterial richness was higher in WHWT than in EB, S and T groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), but there were no significant differences for the evenness and the α‐diversity between groups.
