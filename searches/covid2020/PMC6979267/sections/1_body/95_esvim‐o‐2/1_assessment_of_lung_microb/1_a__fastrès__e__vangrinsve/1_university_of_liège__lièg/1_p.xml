<p>The lung has been recognized to host a diverse, low biomass bacterial population, identified as the lung microbiota (LM). In human chronic lung diseases (CLDs), the LM is altered compared with that of healthy patients. However, whether alterations are a cause or a consequence of the disease is still unclear. In dogs, the LM has been described mostly in healthy experimental beagles. However, in a previous work from our team, an impact of the living conditions and/or of the breed was suspected between healthy beagles and West Highland white terriers (WHWTs). Recent studies in mice and horses showed modifications in the LM according to the living conditions. These modifications in the LM could predispose individuals to certain CLDs. So, we aimed to assess the breed impact and the influence of living conditions, either experimental or domestic, on the LM, in healthy dogs.</p>
