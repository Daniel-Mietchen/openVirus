<p>Healthy dogs were sampled, for a total of 48 dogs, and categorized into 5 groups: experimental Beagle (EB), Shepherd (S), Terrier (T), Brachycephalic (Br) and WHWT dogs, a breed with high susceptibility for canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CIPF). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained under anaesthesia in each dog. After DNA extraction from BALFs, a PCR targeting the V1‚ÄêV3 region of the 16S rDNA was performed. Amplicons were then sequenced on a MiSeq Illumina sequencer. Taxonomical assignation and microbiota community analysis were done with MOTHUR V1.40 with an OTU clustering distance of 0.03.</p>
