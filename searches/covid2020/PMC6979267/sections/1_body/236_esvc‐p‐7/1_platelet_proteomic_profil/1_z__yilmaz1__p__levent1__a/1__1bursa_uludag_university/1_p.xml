<p>Heart failure can cause haemostatic complications due to platelet over‚Äê activation in human and veterinary medicine, especially in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There is not enough information on the molecular relationship between hemostasis and cardiovascular diseases in dogs. Thus, in this study, it was aimed to elaborate hemostasis (coagulation) changes with the platelet proteomic profile in dogs with naturally occurred heart failure.</p>
