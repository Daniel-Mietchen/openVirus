<p>Platelet proteomes (n = 107) were matched with the previously described proteins for 
 <italic>Canis lupus familialis,</italic> and compared to the control, at least 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 level and 1.2‐fold change of proteomes (n = 10) was considered statistically significant. Compared to control group, of platelet proteomes, guanine nucleotide‐binding protein subunit alpha‐11, apolipoprotein C‐III, apolipoprotein A‐II and clusterin levels increased whereas CXC‐motif chemokine‐10, cytochrome‐C‐oxidase subunit‐2, cathepsin‐D, serine/threonine ‐ protein phosphatase PP1‐gamma catalytic subunit, creatine kinase B‐type and myotrophin levels decreased in testgroup. PT and aPTT values in the test group were longer than the control values (P &lt; 0.05).
