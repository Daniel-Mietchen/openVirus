<p>The material of this study consisted of totally 20 dogs with different breed, age, and sexes. Two different group were designed; control (n = 10) and test groups (n = 10). Based on the physical, laboratory and cardiologic examination results, dogs were included into control (healthy) group, or dogs with stage C of heart failure according to ACVIM classification were enrolled into test group. Platelet isolations were performed from each dog, and platelet pellets were stored −80 C until analysed. Platelet proteomes were identified by use of UPLC‐ ESI/QTOF/MS method. Global clotting times (PT and aPTT) were measured, as well.</p>
