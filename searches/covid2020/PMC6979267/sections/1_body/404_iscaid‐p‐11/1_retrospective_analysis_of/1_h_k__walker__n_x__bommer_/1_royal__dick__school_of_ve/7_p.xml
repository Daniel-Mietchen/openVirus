<p>In conclusion, prior vaccination or antibiotic use should not preclude testing for leptospirosis. In contrast to cases reported in mainland Europe, clinical pulmonary disease does not appear to be a feature in these cases. Leptospirosis appears to have been detected incidentally in some cases, potentially signifying a population of dogs with subclinical infection.</p>
