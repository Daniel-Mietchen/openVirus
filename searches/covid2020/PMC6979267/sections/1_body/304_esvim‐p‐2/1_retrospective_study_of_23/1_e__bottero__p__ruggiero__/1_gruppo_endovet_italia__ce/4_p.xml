<p>Twelve of the subjects underwent only medical treatment, 10 underwent medical treatment and endoscopic debulking with mixed techniques (external grasping forceps plus diode laser 5 W, continuous rhythm, 600 μm fiber), and 1 patient underwent surgical rhinotomy. In all the dogs treated only with Prednisolone, despite the clinical improvement, there were constant relapses. All of the subjects that underwent endoscopic debulking showed clinical improvement of the symptoms and absence of relapse, for 6 months in 77.8% of the cases and for 24 months in 44.5% of the cases. In conclusion, nasal polyposis is an infrequent pathology that can present serious clinical symptoms, even in young subjects, and that tends to relapse. Therapy with endoscopic debulking is a less invasive alternative than traditional surgery, even though it does not prevent relapse in the medium and long term.</p>
