<p>Twenty DD on insulin treatment were prospectively enrolled in the study. The FGMS was placed on the neck for up to 14 days. Duringthe 1st‐7th‐14
 <sup>th</sup>days, blood glucose curves (BGCs) have been performed simultaneously in the hospital with FGMS and a validated portable blood glucose meter (PBGM) (OptiumXceed, Abbott®). During the 5th‐6th and 12th‐13
 <sup>th</sup>days the owners performed a BGC using the FGMS at home. The BGCs performed with PBGM and FGMS in hospital and those performed with FGMS at home and in hospital were compared. Each BGCs has been evaluated as optimal considering: 1) 50% of the values between 90‐250 mg/dL or 2) glucose nadir between 90‐180 mg/dL. The glucose nadirs obtained from the data downloaded by the software (DDS), the FGMS scans and the PBGM were compared. Moreover, the glucose day‐time (GDTNs) and night‐time nadirs (GNTNs) were compared.
