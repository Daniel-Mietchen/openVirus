<p>This is the first study to investigate the feline metabolome, in relation to the plasma homocysteine concentration. Our results suggest that the inter‚Äêindividual variability of plasma homocysteine concentration in healthy cats may be associated with metabolic peculiarities. Several discriminating amino acids and biogenic amines are involved in pathways of methionine metabolism. Additionally, higher concentrations of plasmalogens in cats with high plasma homocysteine concentration may indicate enhanced oxidative stress or increased activity of protective mechanisms against oxidative stress.</p>
