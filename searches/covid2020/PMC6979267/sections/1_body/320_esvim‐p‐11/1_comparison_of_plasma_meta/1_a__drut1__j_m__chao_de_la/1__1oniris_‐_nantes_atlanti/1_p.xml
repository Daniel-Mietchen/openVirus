<p>Several prospective observational studies providing data on plasma homocysteine concentration in healthy cats revealed a larger‐than‐expected inter‐individual variability. Investigations conducted on healthy laboratory cats suggested impaired homocysteine metabolism in some individuals, using a methionine loading test. The aim of our study was to determine differences in the metabolomic profile of healthy cats exhibiting low or high plasma homocysteine concentration, respectively.</p>
