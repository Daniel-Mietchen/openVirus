<p>We used left‐over frozen plasma samples from client‐owned healthy adult cats previously enrolled in a prospective observational study that aimed at determining a reference interval for plasma homocysteine concentration in the feline species. We extracted 10 individuals with high plasma homocysteine concentration, and we selected 10 epidemiologically‐matched individuals with low plasma homocysteine concentration. Plasma samples were subjected to a targeted metabolomics analysis using an AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit (Biocrates Life Sciences AG), assessing six biochemical classes: acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and hexoses.</p>
