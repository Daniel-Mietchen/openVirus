<p>The orthogonal partial least‐squares discriminant analysis identified a model discriminating plasma samples from the two populations of healthy cats (R
 <sup>2</sup>X = 0.665, R
 <sup>2</sup>Y = 0.959, Q
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.715). The cross‐validation performance of the model was confirmed by analysis of variance (CV‐ANOVA P‐value = 0.013). Based on this analysis, 56 differentiating metabolites were identified. Cats with high plasma homocysteine concentration exhibited higher concentrations of 29/90 glycerophospholipids, 9/15 sphingolipids, 7/21 biogenic amines, 3/21 AMino acids, and 2/40 acylcarnitines, and showed lower concentrations of 3/21 AMino acids, 2/90 glycerophospholipids and 1/21 biogenic amine, compared to cats with low homocysteine concentration.
