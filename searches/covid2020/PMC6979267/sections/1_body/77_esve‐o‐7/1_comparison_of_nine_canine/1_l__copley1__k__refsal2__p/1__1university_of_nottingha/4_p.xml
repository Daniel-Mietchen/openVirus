<p>Total T4 methods did not agree with one another; e.g., highest pool varied between 39 and 59.5 nmol/L. Two TT4 methods (RIA and ImmKT4) demonstrated good linearity with all points agreeing with predicted concentrations. Of 5 methods that demonstrated less good internal agreement, three were linear but with results that did not match predictions across the range (DRI‐T4, TosT4, SnapT4) and two were non‐linear (ImmTT4, CataT4). ImmVF4 and FT4d were linear, although one data point by FT4d was not as predicted.</p>
