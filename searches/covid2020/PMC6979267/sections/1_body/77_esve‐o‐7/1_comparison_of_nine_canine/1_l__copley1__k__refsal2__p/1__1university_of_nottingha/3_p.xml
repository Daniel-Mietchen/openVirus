<p>Five serum pools of predictably equidistant T4 concentration covering the reference interval were created using sequential 50:50 mixing of 2 initial pools of low and high T4 concentration surplus canine serum and analysed by 7 TT4 (Radioimmunoassay (RIA); Immulite Total T4 (ImmTT4); Immulite Canine Total T4 (ImmKT4); Thermo‐Microgenics Total T4 (DRI‐T4); IDEXX Catalyst T4 (CataT4); IDEXX Snapshot T4 (SnapT4) and Tosoh AIA T4 (TosT4)) and two Free T4 methods (Antech Free T4 by dialysis (FT4d) and Immulite Veterinary Free T4 (ImmVF4)). The mixed pools approach allowed for assessment of internal agreement within each method (linearity) as well as comparison between methods. To determine the impact of T4AA, the same 5 pools were additionally analysed after mixing 50:50 with a T4AA positive canine surplus serum pool.</p>
