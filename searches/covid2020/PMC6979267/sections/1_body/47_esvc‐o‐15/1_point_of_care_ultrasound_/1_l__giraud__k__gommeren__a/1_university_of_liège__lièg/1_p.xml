<p>In human medicine, caudal vena cava (CVC) diameter (CVC
 <sub>D</sub>) and collapsibility index (CVC
 <sub>CI</sub>) evaluated via Point Of Care UltraSound (POCUS) are accepted markers of intravascular volume status. In human chronic heart failure, CVC POCUS helps identifying patients requiring hospitalization or at risk of decompensation. Degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) is the most common acquired canine cardiac disease. It is typically associated with RAAS‚Äêactivation and a subsequent hypervolemic state in advanced stages. Intravascular volume status impacts treatment and is likely correlated with prognosis. In dogs, CVC parameters obtained via POCUS are described markers of intravascular volume status. The goal of this study was to investigate CVC parameters evaluated via POCUS at different ACVIM stages of degenerative mitral valve disease in dogs.
