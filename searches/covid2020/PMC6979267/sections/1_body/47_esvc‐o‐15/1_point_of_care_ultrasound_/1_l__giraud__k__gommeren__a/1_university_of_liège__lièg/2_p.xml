<p>Echocardiographic and CVC POCUS findings of dogs with DMVD presented between January 2017 and January 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. ACVIM stage and recent administration of diuretics were recorded. Dogs with significant right sided heart disease or pericardial effusion were excluded. POCUS CVC Cineloops were obtained during the echocardiographic evaluation, using a longitudinal subxyphoid view with dogs placed in right lateral recumbency. CVC maximal and minimal diameter were measured and indexed on aortic diameter (CVC
 <sub>D‐max</sub>/Ao and CVC
 <sub>D‐min</sub>/Ao), and CVC
 <sub>CI</sub> was calculated. One single observer, unaware of disease severity or ACVIM stage, performed all measurements, and subjectively assessed the CVC as fat, flat or normal. CVC parameters were compared between ACVIM stages using Fisher exac
 <italic>t</italic> test and Kruskal‐Wallis. ANCOVA were used to assess the effect of ACVIM stage and diuretic treatment on CVC parameters. Data are expressed as median and range., 81 dogs with DMVD were included (ACVIM stage B1 (23), B2 (24), C (27), D (7)), 28 had recently received diuretics. CVC parameters were associated with ACVIM stage. CVC
 <sub>D‐min</sub>/Ao was significantly larger, whereas CVC
 <sub>CI</sub> was significantly reduced in dogs with ACVIM stage C or D compared with ACVIM stage B1 or B2 (P‐value &lt;0.01). CVC
 <sub>D‐max</sub>/Ao differed in dogs with ACVIM stage D compared with other stages (p‐value &lt;0.01). There was a significant association between a subjectively fat CVC and advanced DMVD stages (ACVIM C or D) (p‐value &lt;0.0001). ANCOVA revealed that CVC parameters were influenced by ACVIM stages and not by diuretic administration.
