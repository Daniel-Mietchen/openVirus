<p>Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation is a therapeutic approach, approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration in 2010 for human patients with failing pulmonary conduits and for failing bioprosthetic surgical pulmonary valves in 2017. We report here the first case of successful transcatheter implantation of a stented valve in a pulmonary position in a dog with congenital pulmonary valve disease. A 3‐year‐old, 10.9 kg, client‐owned Beagle dog was referred for a follow‐up visit after a percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty performed 22 months before for correcting a severe type A valvular pulmonic stenosis (Doppler‐derived peak trans‐stenotic pressure gradient, D
 <italic>P</italic> = 348 mmHg before the procedure, 66 mmHg 24 hours later). At time of presentation the dog was lethargic, and echocardiography revealed a mild pulmonic stenosis (D
 <italic>P</italic> = 43 mmHg) associated with severe pulmonary regurgitation (proximal width ratio assessed by color‐flow Doppler mode of 100%), and secondary major right ventricular and right atrial dilation. Despite medical therapy, worsening of right heart dilation was observed two months later, and a transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation using a Melody™ valve with a pre‐stenting system was decided. A contrast‐enhanced cardiac‐gated computed tomography 3D scan was performed one week before surgery, to accurately assess the pulmonary and coronary artery morphology, and perform measurements of the pulmonary annulus and the right ventricular outflow tract maximal diameters. Aneurysm of the pulmonary trunk with plications of the arterial wall was confirmed. The initial minimally invasive approach via the left jugular vein with a Seldinger technique was unsuccessful due to the size of the outer diameter of the delivery system and therefore was converted to a left 3rd intercostal thoracotomy and a trans‐ventricular delivery (the approach had been prepped at the same time as the neck area in case of conversion). The dog recovered uneventfully and was discharged 10 days after the procedure. Right heart dilation disappeared within 15 days. The dog is still doing well three months after valve implantation. This case illustrates that pulmonary transcatheter stented valve implantation is technically feasible in the dog with severe pulmonary valve disease. Stented valves as an alternative to open‐heart surgery is the source of tremendous development in human medicine and it can be foreseen that veterinary cardiology will, in some way, benefit from this revolution.
