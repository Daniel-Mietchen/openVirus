<p>In conclusion our study shows that nasal tumors are often diagnosed late, when the nasopharynx is already affected. The most common histological type is adenocarcinoma; benign neoplasia, which is rarely described in the literature, is also frequent. The good response to nasal debulking combined with metronomic therapy makes this multimode approach worthy of further evaluation, both for its reduced cost and for the high quality of life for the patients.</p>
