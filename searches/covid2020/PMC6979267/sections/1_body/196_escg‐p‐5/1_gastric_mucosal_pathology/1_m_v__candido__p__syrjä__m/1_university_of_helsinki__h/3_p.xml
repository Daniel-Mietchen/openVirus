<p>Group A included 20 dogs (median age 9 years [5.5‐11.6], mean CCECAI = 3.4 ± 2.1), and Group B included 11 dogs (median age 9.8 years [7.6‐11.3]). Logistic regression analysis detected no statistical difference in histological findings between Groups A and B concerning mucosal atrophy (A: 14/20; B: 10/11), metaplasia (A: 5/20; B: 3/11), dysplasia (A: 11/20; B: 3/11) or GC (A: 4/20; B: 2/11). Independent of grouping, numerous BSD had atrophy (25/31), followed by dysplasia (15/31), metaplasia (8/31), and GC (6/31). Out of the six dogs with GC, five had also atrophy, four metaplasia, and six dysplasia. Fisher's exact test revealed a significant association of GC with metaplasia (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.026) and dysplasia (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004), but not with atrophy (
 <italic>P</italic> = 1). All neoplasms were gastric adenocarcinomas: 1/6 tubular type and 5/6 partly or completely of the diffuse, non‐cohesive type, including four signet‐ring‐cell carcinomas and one mucinous adenocarcinoma.
