<p>After an online survey for recruitment, anamnesis and laboratory minimal database were performed. Canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index (CCECAI) and signs of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) were used to ascribe dogs in two groups: with or without signs of gastric disease (Group A: CCECAI &gt;1 and/or GER; Group B: CCECAI = 0 and no GER). Gastric inflammation, including mucosal fibrosis and glandular atrophy, was histologically assessed according to standardization guidelines by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association. Mucous metaplasia and glandular dysplasia were rated as present or absent.</p>
