<p>Belgian Shepherd dogs (BSD) are considered at increased risk for gastric carcinoma (GC), mucous metaplasia and glandular dysplasia. In humans, gastric mucosal atrophy, metaplasia and dysplasia are all linked to GC. We performed a prospective clinical trial exploring early diagnosis of such conditions. Gastroscopy with histology of mucosal biopsies was conducted to investigate possible associations of clinical signs, atrophy, metaplasia, dysplasia and GC.</p>
