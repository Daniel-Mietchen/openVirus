<p>This retrospective cohort study was conducted with client‐owned dogs with symptomatic MMVD, which have been treated with a standard protocol (Controls, n = 43) and with the addition of ARBs (Cases, n = 29; irbesartan 6~16 mg/kg/day, n = 20; telmisartan 2~4 mg/kg/day, n = 9) to the conventional treatment. For the initial analysis of homogeneity between two groups, physical examination, comprehensive blood test profile (CBC, serum biochemistry, NT‐proBNP, SDMA), radiographic, and echocardiographic data were collected. Subsequently, the same clinical indices were compared at the time points when ARBs were given for three to six months. In addition, survival analysis was also performed using Kaplan‐Meier curves.</p>
