<p>After 3~6 months treatment, the degree of increases in clinical parameters related to renal function was significantly higher in the control than the case group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01): BUN (+11.3 ± 9.9 vs. ‐3.3 ± 7.9), creatinine (+0.5 ± 0.27 vs. +0.1 ± 0.19), SDMA (+5.1 ± 2.25 vs. +2.0 ± 5.78), sodium level (+3.5 ± 3.31 vs. ‐0.8 ± 3.81). The differences of heart rate (+7.9 ± 12.2 vs. ‐1.5 ± 9.8) and blood pressure (+14.2 ± 14.6 vs. ‐3.8 ± 15.9) between baseline and follow‐up were significantly lower in the case group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the increased level of NT‐proBNP (1621.4 ± 1274.2 vs. 444.3 ± 619.5) was also greater in the controls (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). However, no statistical differences were found in thoracic radiographic and echocardiographic indices between the groups. Comparing survival curves of two groups did not reveal an overall survival advantage with ARBs treatment.
