<p>Follow‐up was available for all cats. Torasemide dosage was increased for 41% (7/17) cats due to the persistence of CHF signs (median time from treatment initiation to dosage change = 7 days [7‐32]; median dosage = 0.26 mg/kg/day [0.19‐0.34]). Additionally, furosemide was added 12 hours after torasemide intake for 29% (5/17) of cats (median time from treatment initiation to furosemide initiation = 15 days [1‐44]; median dosage = 1.13 mg/kg/day [1.09‐1.35]). Other treatments included benazepril (4/17), pimobendane (4/17), clopidogrel (12/17), aspirin (3/17) and spironolactone (3/17). Regression of clinical signs was observed in most cats (16/17), with no remarkable adverse events. Death was reported in 8/17 cats, with 6/8 euthanized as a result of CHF worsening (n = 4) or aortic thromboembolism (n = 2), and death related to CHF for 2/8 cats. Median survival time after torasemide prescription was 96 days [19‐330].</p>
