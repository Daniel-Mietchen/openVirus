<p>The case records of cats treated with torasemide were reviewed. The study population consisted of 17 cats (median age = 10.6 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 6.4‐11.0], male‐to‐female ratio = 2.4), with a majority of Domestic shorthair cats (13/17). All cats presented dyspnea related to CHF (pleural effusion [4/17], pulmonary edema [6/17]or both [7/17]), associated with ascites in 2/17 cats. The cause of CHF was determined in all cats by echocardiography: hypertrophic (8/17,47%), restrictive (3/17,18%), dilated (3/17,18%) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular (2/17,12%) cardiomyopathy, and aortic valve congenital abnormality (1/17,5%). The left atrium (LA) was dilated in all cats, with a median end‐diastolic LA‐to‐aorta‐ratio of 1.97 [IQR = 1.80‐2.11, normal values &lt;1.2]. Median torasemide dosage at initiation was 0.20 mg/kg/day [IQR = 0.17‐0.23].</p>
