<p>Torasemide is a loop diuretic whose safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF). Torasemide is characterized by a longer duration of action, a more potent diuretic action, and a higher bioavailability than furosemide. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has focused on the efficacy and safety of torasemide in cats with CHF. The objectives of this retrospective study were therefore to 1) describe the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and document the clinical outcome of cats with CHF treated with oral torasemide, and 2) identify potential adverse events related to torasemide administration in this feline population.</p>
