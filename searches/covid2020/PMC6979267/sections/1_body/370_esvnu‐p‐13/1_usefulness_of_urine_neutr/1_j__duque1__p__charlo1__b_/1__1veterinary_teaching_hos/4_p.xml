<p>The urinary uNGAL/CR (μg/g; mean ± SD) was 1082 ± 782 in group C;5210 ± 3676 for G1;38 446 ± 12 269 in G2;453 219 ± 322 898 for G3 and 4 306 983 ± 3 852 666 in G4. For uCysC/CR (μg/g; mean ± SD) the values obtained were 80 ± 54 in C; 485 ± 249 in G1; 475 ± 81 in G2; 9294 ± 7992 in G3 and 36 450 ± 22 571 in G4. For both biomarkers statistically significant differences were found between the control group and all the rest. G1 and G2 were significantly different compared to G3 and G4 for NGAL and CysC. Additionally, CysC values differed significantly between G3 and G4.</p>
