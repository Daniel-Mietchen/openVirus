<p>Across sites, 504 individual proteins were identified. Normalized spectral abundance demonstrated pancreatic proteins were increased compared to pepsin in GF. Significant differences in DA between groups was noted (P &lt; 0.0001): GF vs normal (n = 130), cough vs. normal (n = 22), reflux/vomiting vs. normal (n = 20). Marked between‐dog variation was observed for proteins with DA. Functional proteome was dissimilar between all groups (
