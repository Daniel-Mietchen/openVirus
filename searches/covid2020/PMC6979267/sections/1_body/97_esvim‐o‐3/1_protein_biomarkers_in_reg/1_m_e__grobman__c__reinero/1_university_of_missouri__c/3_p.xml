<p>Twenty‐three client‐owned dogs were prospectively enrolled. Canine GF samples (n = 5) and OP swabs in normal (n = 6), vomiting/regurgitating (n = 7), and coughing (n = 5) dogs were evaluated. Protein digests were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). Data were searched against the NCBIMus database. Differential abundance (DA) of proteins and functionality between groups was evaluated by Fisher Exact test and ANOSIM respectively. A
