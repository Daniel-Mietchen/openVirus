<p>In conclusion, our data seem to indicate that small breed dogs show a greater tolerance to congenital volume overload, and for this reason it could be possible to delay the PDA closure of a few months allowing weight gain that makes easier the interventional procedure. On the other hand, the large breed dogs should be submitted to ductal closure as soon as possible, in order to avoid an excessive LV wall stress.</p>
