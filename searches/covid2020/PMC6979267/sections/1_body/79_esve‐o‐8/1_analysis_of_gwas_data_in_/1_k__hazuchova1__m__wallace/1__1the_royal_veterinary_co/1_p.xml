<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) in cats resembles human type 2 DM, a complex disease involving a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In a previous genome‚Äêwide association study (GWAS), 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found to be associated with DM in lean Domestic Shorthair (DSH) cats, and a polymorphism in the MC4R gene was associated with DM in overweight DSH cats in a candidate gene study. Susceptibility genes in Burmese cats, a breed predisposed to DM, had not been identified in the initial GWAS study.</p>
