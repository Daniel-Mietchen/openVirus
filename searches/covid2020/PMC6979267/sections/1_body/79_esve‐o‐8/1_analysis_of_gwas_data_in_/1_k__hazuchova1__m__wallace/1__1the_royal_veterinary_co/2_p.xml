<p>In an attempt to overcome some of the limitations present in the Burmese breed due to inbreeding, data from the previous GWAS of DM in DSH and Burmese cats was combined for analysis. Genotyping was performed using Illumina Infinium 63 k iSelect DNA array, and after quality filtering, 390 diabetic and 390 non‐diabetic control DSH cats, as well as 19 diabetic and 21 control Burmese cats were included in the analysis. Controls were significantly older than diabetic cats (P &lt; 0.0001). Body condition score (BCS) was known for 718 cats, 62% of these were lean and 38% were obese. Stratified analysis using a Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel (CMH) test within strata defined in the multidimensional scaling (MDS), and logistic regression with MDS coordinates, using BCS and breed as covariates, were conducted for case:control association testing. P‐values from the CMH test were adjusted for genomic inflation (λ = 1.187), and feline standard genome‐wide significance was set at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10e‐5. Max(T) permutations were used to generate corrected empirical P‐values following logistic regression; significance was set at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. A single significant SNP (chrC1:125033967; P
 <sub>raw</sub> [adjusted for genomic inflation] = 9.58x10e‐6) was identified in the stratified analysis, and a single significant SNP (chrA2:3535683; P
 <sub>genome</sub> [100000 permutations] = 2.75x10e‐3) was identified in logistic regression. The SNP in chromosome A2 was associated with DM in the previously reported GWAS of DM in lean DSH, but the association with the SNP in chromosome C1 in both breeds is new. These SNPs are located within and close to DPP10 and DPP9 genes, respectively, which are related to DPP4, an enzyme involved in degradation of incretins. This further analysis has revealed new potential candidate genes in both breeds, highlighting the usefulness of this alternative approach to the GWAS analysis. Both DPP9 and DPP10 have been implicated in metabolic and immune functions, suggesting that further investigation of these genes in the pathogenesis of feline DM is warranted.
