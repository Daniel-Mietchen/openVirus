<p>The combined effect of setting and sequence was associated with lower systolic (SBP), mean arterial (MAP) and diastolic BP (DBP) when BP was measured by the owner with the cat in its own carrier last in sequence (all; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0039). Heart rate was higher when BP was measured with cat on examination table first in the sequence (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0006). When measurements were made with the cat on the examination table, higher coefficients of variation (CVs) were found for SBP, MAP, DBP and HR (all; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001).
