<p>Ninety‐six healthy cats were prospectively included. The health examination included physical examination, echocardiography, hematology, and biochemistry. Blood pressure was measured with a high‐definition oscillometric (HDO) device, with cuff on tail in three clinical settings; (1) cat taken out of its carrier and placed on examination table with veterinarian present, (2) cat in its own carrier with veterinarian present, or (3) cat in its own carrier without veterinarian present. The owner was present in all settings. The sequence of clinical settings was randomized and 4‐6 recordings were made in each setting.</p>
