<p>Histological diagnosis showed tubulopapilliform RC and solid high‐malignant PRCa in all cases. Most TCC were high‐malignant (55/78 ubTC, 28/28 uTC, 8/9 sTCC). BRAF‐mutation was detected in 0/10 RCa, 1/6 RPCa, 36/78 ubTCC, 16/28 uTCC, 6/9 sTCC. It was significantly (

However, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of BRAF‐mutation between the different sites of TCC in urinary bladder and/or urethra. Statistical correlation of histological degree of TCC in LUT and BRAF‐mutation was not obvious. BRAF‐mutation was identified significantly more frequent in ubTcc of terriers (20/25, 75%) than in other breeds (21/57, 35%) (
