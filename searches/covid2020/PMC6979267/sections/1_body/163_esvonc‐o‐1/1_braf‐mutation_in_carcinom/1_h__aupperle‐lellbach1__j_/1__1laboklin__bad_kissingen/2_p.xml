<p>Dogs included in this study were 23 terriers (7 Scottish, 7 Jack Russel, 3 West Highland White, 2 Airedale, 3 Fox, 2 Yorkshire, 1 Welsh, 1 Irish Soft Coated Wheaten) and 108 dogs of other breeds (eg, 40 mongrels, 6 Beagle, 5 Bearnaise Mountain Dogs, 4 Cocker Spaniel) in the age of median 11 years. Formalin fixed samples from carcinomas of the urinary tract (renal tubular carcinoma (RCa, n = 10), TCC of renal pelvis (RPCa, n = 6), TCC of urinary bladder (ubTCC, n = 78), TCC in urethra (uTCC, n = 28), and TCC simultaneously in urethra and urinary bladder (sTCC, n = 9) were histopathologically diagnosed. DNA‐isolation was performed by using a QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit. Exon 15 of chromosome 16 was examined for the presence of BRAF‐mutation c.1799 T &gt; A by TaqMan SNP assay. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.03.</p>
