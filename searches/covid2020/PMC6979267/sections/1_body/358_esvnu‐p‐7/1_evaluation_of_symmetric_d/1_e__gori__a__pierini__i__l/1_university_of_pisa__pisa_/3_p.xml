<p>Dogs with AP, presented at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of University of Pisa between 2017 and 2019, were prospectively enrolled. AP diagnosis was based on compatible clinical and laboratory parameters, abnormal SNAP cPL test (Idexx Laboratories) and positive abdominal ultrasound within 48 h from admission. Dogs with a history of renal diseases (clinical records/history, bloodwork and diagnostic imaging), urinary tract infection and/or on hemodialysis treatment were excluded, along with dogs that had received known nephrotoxic drugs (eg. non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, aminoglycosides). For each dog, data about urea, creatinine and urinary output (UO) were recorded. Acute kidney injury (AKI) grading was made based on current IRIS consensus. Canine Acute Pancreatitis Severity (CAPS) was calculated for each dog at presentation and previously described cut‐off of 11 was used to divide dog into two groups (CAPS &lt; and &gt; 11). SDMA was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The SDMA was compared between UO groups (O, NO), presence of AKI and with CAPS score groups using Mann‐Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>‐test or Welch's 
 <italic>t</italic>‐test based on normality distribution. SDMA was correlated with urea and creatinine levels using Spearman's correlation test.
