<p>Fifty‐one dogs with diagnosis of AP were enrolled with owners' informed consent. Sixteen dogs showed AKI and 11 of them were oligo‐anuric. Overall median SDMA was 13.8 mg/dL (range 0.6‐65 mg/dL). Twenty‐three dogs (45%), of which 13 in non‐AKI group, had SDMA above reference range (15 mg/dL). Median SDMA was significantly higher in AKI dogs (18.5 vs. 12.4 mg/dL; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). Both urea and creatinine concentration showed a positive correlation with SDMA level in AKI dogs (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.6 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.7, respectively) but the same correlations were not significant in non‐AKI group. No association between SDMA and UO was found. Finally, dogs with CAPS&gt;11 had higher SDMA compared to dogs with CAPS&lt;11 (26.9 ± 5 mg/dL vs. 13.8 ± 1.5 mg/dL, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). Based on our results, SDMA seems to be associated with disease severity (CAPS).
