<p>Analysis of ecological indexes showed that bacterial richness (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) and α‐diversity (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) were significantly higher in BC group compared to the two other groups. The AMOVA analysis indicated that the BC group was different compared to DC and T groups (BC vs DC 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02; BC vs T 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). There was no difference in bacterial load between groups and no effect of the living conditions.
