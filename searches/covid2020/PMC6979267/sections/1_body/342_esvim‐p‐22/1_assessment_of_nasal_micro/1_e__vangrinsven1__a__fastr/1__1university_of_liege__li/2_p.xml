<p>Fourty‐six healthy dogs were recruited, including 22 medium to large dogs from dolichocephalic breeds (DC), 12 brachycephalic dogs (BC) and 12 terrier dogs (T). All dogs were older than 14 months. Dogs were living either in rural (n = 21) or urban domestic conditions (n = 25). Nasal swabs were obtained under anesthesia and banked at −80°C until batched analysis. After DNA extraction, a PCR targeting the V1‐V3 region of the 16S rDNA was performed. Amplicons were then sequenced on a MiSeq Illumina sequencer. Taxonomical assignation and microbiota community analysis were done with MOTHUR V1.41.0 with an OTU clustering distance of 0.03.</p>
