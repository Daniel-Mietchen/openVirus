<p>Dolichocephalic breeds are predisposed to sinonasal aspergillosis while brachycephalic dogs are not affected. Since disruptions in the resident microbiome may contribute to disease pathogenesis by modulating immune responses and since microbiota dictates the type of host‚Äêfungus relationship, we hypothetized that differences in predisposition to nasal disease in dogs could be associated with differences in core nasal microbiota between breeds.</p>
