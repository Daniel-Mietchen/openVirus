<p>The nasal microbial population was predominantly composed of the phyla 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>(mainly represented by the family 
 <italic>Moraxellaceae</italic>), 
 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, in agreement with previous studies. However, within each breed group, the relative abundance in phyla was highly variable and no significant differences were found between groups while at the family level, the relative abundance in 
 <italic>Pasteurellaceae</italic> was significantly higher in the BC group. Distinct species and genera were found as indicators of discrimination (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;â€‰0.05) among which 8 species and 9 genera in the BC group and 1 species in the T group.
