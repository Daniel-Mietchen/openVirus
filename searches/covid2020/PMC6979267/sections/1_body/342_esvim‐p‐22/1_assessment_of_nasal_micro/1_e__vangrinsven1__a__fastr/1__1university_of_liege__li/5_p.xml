<p>Our study mainly demonstrated significant differences in the nasal microbiota in the BC group compared with the two other groups. Such differences might be associated to a particular facial morphology and/or breathing pattern in brachycephalic dogs. We did not identify nasal microbiota breed‚Äêdifferences that would be in favor of a breed susceptibility of dolichocephalic dogs for nasal diseases. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of nasal microbiota variations as a trigger or a perpetuating factor in nasal diseases, especially in dogs with sinonasal aspergillosis.</p>
