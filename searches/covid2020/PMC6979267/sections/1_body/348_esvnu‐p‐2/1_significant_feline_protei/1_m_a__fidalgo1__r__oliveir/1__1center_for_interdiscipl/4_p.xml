<p>Sixty‐one cats were selected, including 28 females (21 spayed, 7 intact) and 33 males (26 neutered, 7 intact), with an average of 12 years old. No cats had physiological or pre‐renal proteinuria, 46/61 (75%) presented renal proteinuria, 4/61 (7%) had post‐renal proteinuria and 11/61 (18%) had a suspected mixed origin (renal + post‐renal). In detail, the causes of renal proteinuria were CKD (39/61; 64%), CKD complicated with co‐morbidities (2/61; 3%), acute kidney injury (AKI) (2/61; 3%) and diseases capable of decreasing renal permselectivity (3/61; 5%). Post‐renal proteinuria was due to urinary tract infection (UTI) (3/61; 5%) and cystitis (1/61; 2%). Mixed‐proteinuria was attributed to CKD + cystitis (7/61; 11%) and CKD + UTI (4/61; 7%).</p>
