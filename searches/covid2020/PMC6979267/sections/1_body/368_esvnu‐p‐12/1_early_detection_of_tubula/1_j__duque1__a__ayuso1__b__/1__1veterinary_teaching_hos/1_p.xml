<p>Renal damage associated with canine leishmaniasis induces nephritis and glomerulonephritis which cannot always be detected using classical laboratorial biomarkers (creatinine, urea, protein/creatinine ratio and urine specific gravity). N‐acetyl‐β‐D‐glucosaminidase (NAG) and glutamyl

Hence, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic power of urinary NAG and GGT as early markers of renal disease in dogs affected with leishmaniasis using a modified IRIS chronic kidney disease staging.
