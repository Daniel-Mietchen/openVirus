<p>This study shows that uNAGC/CR appears to be a good biomarker for early detection of renal tubular damage at early stages of canine leishmaniasis, prior to the presence of azotaemia and proteinuria. On the contrary, uGGT/CR appears to be less useful for this purpose, as it is only consistently elevated at more advanced stages of leishmania‚Äêassociated chronic kidney disease.</p>
