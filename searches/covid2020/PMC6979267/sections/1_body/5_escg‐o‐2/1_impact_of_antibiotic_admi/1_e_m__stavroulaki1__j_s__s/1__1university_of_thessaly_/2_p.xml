<p>Naturally passed feces were collected from 17 healthy kittens that did not receive antibiotics (Group 1), 14 kittens that received amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for 20 days (Group 2), and 13 kittens that received doxycycline for 28 days (Group 3) as part for standard treatment of upper respiratory tract infection. Kittens were approximately 2 months of age, on the same diet and the same antiparasitic treatment prior to sample collection. Fecal samples were collected on days 0 (before antibiotic treatment), 20 or 28 (Group 2 and Group 3, respectively; after the end of antibiotic administration), and 60. DNA was extracted from each sample and qPCRs were performed for total bacteria,
