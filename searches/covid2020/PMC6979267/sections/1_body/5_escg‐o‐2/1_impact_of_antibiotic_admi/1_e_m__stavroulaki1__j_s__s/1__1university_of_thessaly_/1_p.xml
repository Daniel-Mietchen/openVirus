<p>In humans, antibiotic use results in long‐lasting changes of the bacterial constituents of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Antibiotic‐induced microbial shifts are associated with predisposition to certain diseases such as chronic GI diseases, obesity, and allergies. No studies exist in kittens investigating the effect of antibiotic administration on the GI microbiota and the duration of this effect. The study aim was to determine the effect of antibiotic administration in kittens on certain bacterial groups that are potentially associated with dysbiosis.</p>
