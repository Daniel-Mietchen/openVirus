<p>44 dogs (median age 11.9, interquartile range 10.0‐13.3 years) with chronic pulmonary disease and documented chronic hypoxia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO
 <sub>2</sub>] &lt;80 mmHg on at least two separate arterial blood gas measurements minimum of 1 month apart) were retrospectively identified from patient records. Dogs of sight hound breeds were excluded. The diagnosis was based on thorough clinical examinations including bronchoscopy and brochoalveolar lavage, thoracic computed tomography, lung histopathology or a combination of the aforementioned. Statistical correlation between PaO
 <sub>2</sub> and red blood cell parameters was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficients.
