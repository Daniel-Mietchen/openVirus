<p>Median duration of hypoxia was 8 months (IQR 4‐18 months) and the mean PaO
 <sub>2</sub> at the end of the period was 62.2 mmHg (SD [STD] ± 9.9 mmHg). Red blood cell parameters measured at the end of hypoxemia period were within the laboratory reference range in majority of dogs; Erythrocyte count (Erytr) was normal in 35/44 dogs (mean 7.4 ± STD 0.9 x10
 <sup>12</sup>/L, range 4.9‐9.3 x10
 <sup>12</sup>/L, laboratory reference range 5.3‐8.0 x10
 <sup>12</sup>/L), hemoglobin concentration (Hb) was normal in 42/44 dogs (mean 173 ± STD 21 g/L, range 121‐221 g/L, laboratory reference range 140‐203 g/L) and hematocrit (Hkr) was normal in 39/44 dogs (mean 51.0 ± STD 5.7%, range 35‐64%, laboratory reference range 38‐57%). Marked polycythemia (hematocrit ≥65%) was not noted in any of the dogs. Red blood cell parameters were not correlated with the severity of hypoxia (correlation to PaO
