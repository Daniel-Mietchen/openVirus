<p>The results of this study do not support an increase in urinary calcium excretion with an increase in dietary sodium at commercially relevant levels. The increase in urine volume seen with the high salt diet decreased the urinary calcium and oxalate concentrations, and could explain the decrease in CaOx RSS. An increase in dietary sodium therefore decreases the risk of CaOx urolithiasis in short‚Äêterm feeding trials. Further studies are required to assess the effect of increased dietary sodium when diets are fed for a longer period of time.</p>
