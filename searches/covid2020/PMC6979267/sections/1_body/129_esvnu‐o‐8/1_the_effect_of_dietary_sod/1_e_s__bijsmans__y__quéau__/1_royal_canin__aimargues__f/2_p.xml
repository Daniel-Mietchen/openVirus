<p>The aim of this study was to compare the effect of two dry pet foods differing only in sodium chloride content on urinary volume, urinary calcium excretion and concentration, and CaOx RSS in a cross‐over study using 8 healthy colony dogs. A base diet was produced with a sodium content of 0.3% as fed (LSD). This formula was supplemented with NaCl to achieve high‐sodium diet (HSD) (1% sodium as fed ‐ comparable to commercially available high‐salt urinary diet). The dogs were fed each diet for 7 days followed by 3 days of urine collection. Urinary minerals were measured on pooled 3‐day samples using ionic chromatography. CaOx RSS was calculated using SUPERSAT software. The impact of diet on urinary volume, calcium excretion and concentration, oxalate concentration, and CaOx RSS was evaluated using the Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum test (significance set at P &lt; 0.05). Data are presented as median[25th,75th percentile].</p>
