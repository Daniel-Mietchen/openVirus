<p>Brachycephalic morphotype quantitatively evaluated was not associated with pituitary tumor size in dogs with CD. Our results are in contrast with a previous study focusing on pituitary samples collected mainly by necropsy and embracing dog with and without CD. The sole inclusion of dogs with CD in our study may explain this discrepancy. A possible predisposition of BD to undifferentiated, rapidly growing non‚Äêfunctioning pituitary tumors remains to be assessed.</p>
