<p>Serum cobalamin concentration is frequently assessed in companion animals, especially when facing a patient with chronic gastrointestinal signs. Although the clinician's attention is mainly focused on patients with hypocobalaminaemia, recent studies in humans and cats suggest that high serum cobalamin concentration could be associated with specific conditions such as neoplasia and liver disease and, in addition, may be a marker of severity. The aims of this retrospective, cross‚Äêsectional study were therefore to identify the conditions associated with hypercobalaminaemia in dogs and to determine whether it could be used as a marker of disease severity in these patients.</p>
