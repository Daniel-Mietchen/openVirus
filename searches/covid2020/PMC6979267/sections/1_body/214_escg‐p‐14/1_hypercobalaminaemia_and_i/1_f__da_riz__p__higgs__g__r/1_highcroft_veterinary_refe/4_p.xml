<p>There were significantly more dogs with high serum folate concentration in the hypercobalaminaemia group, as compared to the other groups (
 <italic>P</italic> =â€‰0.009). Dogs with hypoalbuminaemia, anaemia, high ALT activity and/or hypocholesterolaemia were also compared between the three cobalamin groups and no statistical difference was identified. There was no association found between hypercobalaminaemia and the parameters tested for disease severity.
