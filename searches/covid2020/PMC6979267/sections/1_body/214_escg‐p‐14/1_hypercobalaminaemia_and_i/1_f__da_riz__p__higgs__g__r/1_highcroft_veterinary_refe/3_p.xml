<p>One hundred‐and‐sixty dogs were included in the study and divided into three groups: hypocobalaminaemia (39 dogs), normal serum cobalamin concentration (74 dogs) and hypercobalaminaemia (47 dogs). The age distribution was significantly different between groups (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0214), with hypercobalaminaemic dogs being significantly younger (median age 79 months, range [2‐207]). Dogs with hypercobalaminaemia presented with diarrhoea (49%), vomiting (47%), inappetence (38%), lethargy (40%) and/or weight loss (38%); this was not significantly different from the other groups. Conditions associated with hypercobalaminaemia included gastrointestinal (57%), hepatic (11%), neurological (11%), endocrine (9%), renal (4%), pancreatic (2%) and miscellaneous (6%) diseases. Among all, 11% had neoplasia. This distribution was not significantly different from hypocobalaminaemic and normocobalaminaemic dogs.
