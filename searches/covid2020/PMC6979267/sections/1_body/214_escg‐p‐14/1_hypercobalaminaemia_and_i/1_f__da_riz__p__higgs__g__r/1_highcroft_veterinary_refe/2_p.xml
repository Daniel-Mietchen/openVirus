<p>Medical records of dogs having serum cobalamin measured between November 2016 and December 2018 in 14 practices in the United Kingdom were reviewed. Dogs were excluded if they had received cobalamin supplementation at any time prior to analysis. Signalment, clinical signs, laboratory &amp; imaging findings were recorded for each case. The cases were then classified into different disease categories by consensus depending on the final diagnosis. Values were expressed as percentages and medians and variables were compared between groups using a Kruskal‐Wallis, Chi‐2 or Fischer's exact test.</p>
