<p>Twenty Holter recordings free from pathologic arrhythmias and ten recordings each of supraventricular premature complexes (SPVCs), complex supraventricular ectopy, ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), complex ventricular ectopy, atrial fibrillation (AF), high‐grade second degree atrioventricular block (AVB) and paced rhythms were retrospectively evaluated and utilized for one‐hour LP generation. Beat origin was color coded. Patterns found in each arrhythmia group were described, and arrhythmia numbers and LP shape measurements were reported.</p>
