<p>Normal Holter recordings uniformly showed a torch morphology with variable silent zones. Premature beats were associated with double and triple side lobe patterns, with variations resulting from multiple coupling intervals and variable post‚Äêectopic pauses. Complex ectopic rhythms were evidenced by a small data point concentration in the lower left corner of the LP. Recordings with AF uniformly showed a fan pattern consistent with random atrioventricular nodal conduction, and recordings with AVB showed island patterns consistent with variable atrioventricular nodal conduction. Paced rhythms were torpedo shaped when the rhythm was completely controlled by the pacemaker.</p>
