<p>24‐hours urine collection, total body water content (tBWC) using pharmacokinetic equation, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using plasma exogenous creatinine clearance, serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), complete plasma biochemistry and urinalysis (including urine protein‐to‐creatinine ratio) were obtained in 14 beagles dogs in a 2x2 blinded against placebo cross‐over design. One group received a 7‐days course of immune‐suppressive prednisolone while the second received the placebo. After a 4‐weeks wash‐out period, groups were switched. Blood and urine were collected before and after each treatment period and during wash‐out. A general linear model was used to test period, sequence, treatment, dog and weight effects. A Dunnett test was used to evaluate the effect of steroid with day 0 serving as control. Correlations were assessed using Pearson's coefficient.</p>
