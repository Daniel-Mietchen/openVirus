<p>Forty nine dogs (77.7%) had serum elevation of gamma glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubine, enlarged gallbladders, finely striated or immobile stellate bile patterns, thickened gallbladder walls, biliary sludge or hyperechogenic gallbladder masses. Older dogs and small breeds were overrepresented. Most dogs presented non‚Äêspecific clinical signs such as vomiting, anorexia and lethargy, diarrhea and/or fever. Thirty four dogs (53.9%) were diagnosed with extrahepatic biliary disease: gallbladder mucocele (n = 21 dogs), cholelitiasis (n = 8 dogs) and colecystitis (n = 5 dogs) upon ultrasound examination, histologic/macroscopic evaluation and culture and sensitivity tests. The incidence of gallbladder mucocele was found to be the highest (33,3%) followed by cholelitiasis (12.6%) and colecystitis (7.9%).</p>
