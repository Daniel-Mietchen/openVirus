<p>Erythrocyte membranes were isolated from EDTA‐treated blood and a cluster of 10 FA, that is, saturated [SFA (palmitic; stearic)], mono‐unsaturated [MUFA (palmitoleic; oleic; vaccenic)], polyunsaturated [ω‐6 (PUFA‐ω6): linoleic, dihomo‐gamma‐linolenic, arachidonic and ω‐3 (PUFA‐ω3): eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic] FA, was determined by Gas‐Chromatography. Results are referred as % of one FA in the cluster. Relevant lipid parameters (SFA/MUFA, SFA/PUFA, ω6/ω3, PUFA balance, unsaturation and peroxidation indexes) were calculated.</p>
