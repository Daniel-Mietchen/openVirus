<p>HD dogs were 30 males (6 neutered) and 38 females (12 sterilized) with a median age of 41 months (2‐156), while CE dogs were 20 males and 9 females (4 sterilized) with a median age of 43 months (10‐114). Among CE dogs 11 were diagnosed with FRE, 1 ARE, 6 IRE, while 11 are undergoing diagnostic trials or were lost to follow‐up. Diminished value of palmitic acid (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and increased value of stearic acid (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), with decreased total SFA (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) were observed in CE group. Among PUFA‐ω6, CE dogs showed increased values of dihomo‐gamma‐linolenic (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and arachidonic (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) acids, while no differences were observed in PUFA‐ω3 levels between the two groups. Unsaturation (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and peroxidation (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) indexes were found significantly increased in CE dogs. Interestingly, dogs with FRE and IRE dogs had similar erythrocyte membrane lipidome profiles; ARE was not object of statistical analysis, due to the low number of dogs in this group.
