<p>Overall, the most common presentation was respiratory distress, (10 of 44 cats), followed by lethargy (n = 9) and collapse (n = 8). Cats with AF had a slower median heart rate (220 [range 180‐260 bpm] compared to cats with SVT (300 [range 150‐380] bpm, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). All cats with AF had cardiac chamber remodelling whereas 4 cats with SVT had no structural abnormalities. Left atrial diameter was significantly larger in AF cats (23.7(16.2‐40.1) mm, compared to 19.1 (12.8‐31.4) mm in SVT cats; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.019)). Median survival was 58 days (1‐780) in cats with AF compared with 259 days (2‐2295) in cats with SVT (p = 0.112). Cats presenting with signs of CHF had worse overall survival (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001); rhythm diagnosis, ventricular arrhythmia, left atrial size and heart rate had no impact on survival status.
