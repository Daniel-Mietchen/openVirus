<p>Forty‐four client‐owned cats were included in this retrospective study; 23 cats with SVT and 21 with AF. Cats were examined between November 2004 and April 2014. Inclusion criteria were availability of a 50 mm/s 6‐lead ECG and a concurrent echocardiographic study. Continuous variables were compared between groups using a two‐sample t‐test or Mann‐Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test and categorical variables were summarised using Chi‐squared or Fisher's exact test. Kaplan‐Meier survival curves were generated to assess for impact of rhythm diagnosis, presence of ventricular arrhythmia, left atrial diameter, heart rate and congestive heart failure status on cardiac death. Differences in survival between groups were compared using Mantel‐Cox logrank comparison of Kaplan‐Meier survival curves.
