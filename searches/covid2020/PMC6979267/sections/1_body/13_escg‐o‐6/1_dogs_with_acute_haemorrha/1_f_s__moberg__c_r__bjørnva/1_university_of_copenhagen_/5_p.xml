<p>Of the 128 dogs, where an obvious cause for the diarrhoea were not found and that only received supportive treatment (intravenous fluid therapy N = 128; antiemetics N = 98; gastroprotectants N = 107), 98% survived to discharge (125/128 dogs). Two dogs were euthanized due to financial constraints and reluctance from the owner to proceed with further treatment due to advanced age and one brachycephalic dog suffered a respiratory crisis with respiratory arrest non‐responsive to resuscitation. The surviving 125 dogs were hospitalized for an average of 1.7 days (range 1‐4 days) with a mean AHDS‐score of 12 at hospitalization (range 4‐16). The mean AHDS‐score after 24 hours of hospitalization was 5.5 (range 0‐14). 29% (37/128) of the dogs met ≥2 SIRS criteria during hospitalization. None of the 128 dogs had a degenerative left‐shift.</p>
