<p>This study shows that raised cTnI concentration and ventricular arrhythmias are common following 
 <italic>vipera berus</italic> envenomation in dogs and highlights the value of prolonged ECG monitoring of these patients. Dogs that developed pathological arrhythmias could not be differentiated from those that did not, based on SS score. Normal cTnI concentrations did not rule out the development of pathological arrhythmias, in this study.
