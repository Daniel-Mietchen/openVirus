<p>Twenty‐two dogs bitten by 
 <italic>vipera berus</italic> were included in this prospective cohort study. An ambulatory ECG (AECG) was placed on each dog at presentation, for 24‐54 hours. Arrhythmia grades of 0‐3 were assigned based on frequency and severity of arrhythmia during AECG recording (modified from previously described grading systems). Serum was obtained at presentation, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 14 days post bite, for cTnI analysis. An SS score of 1‐3 was recorded upon admission using a previously described grading system.
