<p>Envenomation by the European adder (v
 <italic>ipera berus</italic>), is a common seasonal presentation in small animal practice in Norway. Cardiac arrhythmias are observed in patients but studies describing their time course and severity are limited. Cardiac auscultation and short in‚Äêhospital electrocardiograms (ECGs) are insensitive for the detection of arrhythmias and as such, many may go undetected.
