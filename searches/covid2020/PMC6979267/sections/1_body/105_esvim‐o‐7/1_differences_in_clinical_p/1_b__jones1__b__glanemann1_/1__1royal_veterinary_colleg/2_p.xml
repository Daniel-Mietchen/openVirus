<p>Electronic records of canine patients of a tertiary referral centre were searched over a 10 year period for IMHA‐related keywords. A recently‐published algorithm was used to assess the confidence of diagnosis of IMHA. Cases with sufficient features of IMHA were analysed further but were excluded if investigations revealed possible underlying disease or were incomplete. Cases were also excluded if they had received immunosuppressive or blood transfusion therapy more than 48 hours prior to presentation. For cases fulfilling inclusion criteria, the most frequent five breeds were selected for analysis, as well as ‘cross breeds’ to serve as a control group. Data were collected on the historical and clinical signs, clinicopathological findings and outcomes.</p>
