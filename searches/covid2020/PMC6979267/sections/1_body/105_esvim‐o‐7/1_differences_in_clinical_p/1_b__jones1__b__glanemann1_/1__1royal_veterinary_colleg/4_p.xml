Cocker Spaniels (n = 36), Springer Spaniels (n = 25), Labradors (n = 15), Jack Russell Terriers (n = 13) and Shih‐tzus (n = 11) were selected for final analysis, alongside crossbreeds (n = 24) as a control group. Labradors were significantly older when compared to the control group (mean 8.6 v. 5.9 years,
