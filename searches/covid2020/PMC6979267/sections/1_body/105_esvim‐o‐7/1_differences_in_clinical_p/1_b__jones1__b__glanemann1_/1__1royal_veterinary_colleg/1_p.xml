<p>Canine primary immune‐mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a common haematological emergency and the incidence differs among breeds. It is unknown whether dogs of predisposed breeds present with different degrees of disease severity, different clinical signs or differences in clinicopathological findings. This information could be used in the clinic to guide treatment and provide prognostic advice for owners. The primary aim of this retrospective study was to identify any differences in these findings and outcomes in some of the commonly‐affected breeds. We hypothesised that spaniel breeds would have findings associated with more severe disease and poorer outcomes compared to other breeds.</p>
