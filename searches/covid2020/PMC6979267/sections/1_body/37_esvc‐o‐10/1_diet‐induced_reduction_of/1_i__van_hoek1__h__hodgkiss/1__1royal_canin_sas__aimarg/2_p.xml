<p>Cats with diastolic interventricular septum (IVSd) and/or left ventricular wall (LVWd) thickness ≥ 6 mm were included after informed owner‐consent. Examination of non‐sedated, fasted cats before and after 6 and 12 months of test or control diet included auscultation, bodyweight (BW), body condition score (BCS) and echocardiography. Wall thicknesses measured by M‐ and 2D‐mode at basal, mid (LVWd, IVSd) and apical (IVSd) level were recorded as maximum (max‐), sum‐ and number of areas ≥6 mm (n‐)). Blood analysis included NT‐proBNP, ultra‐sensitive troponin‐I (c‐TnI), serum amyloid A (SAA), insulin, glucose and IGF‐1. Linear and generalized mixed models analyzed diet, time and diet‐time interactions with significance level of 5%.</p>
