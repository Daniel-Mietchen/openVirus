<p>Tumours of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses account for approximately 1% of all canine neoplasms. The treatment of choice for intranasal tumors is radiotherapy. Rhinotomy is associated with morbidity and a shorter survival than radiotherapy. The objective of this study was to retrospectively analyze the outcome of dogs with nasal tumours treated surgically. Patients with clinically low‐grade nasal tumours, defined by clinical signs persistent for more than 6 months and no signs beyond local disease, were treated with surgery.</p>
