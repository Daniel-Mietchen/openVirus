<p>Eighteen dogs were included. Twelve had carcinomas (9 adenocarcinomas, 2 transitional type carcinomas and 1 adenosquamous) and 6 sarcomas (1 chondrosarcoma, 1 peripheral nerve sheath tumour and 1 haemangiosarcoma). The main complains were sneezing, nasal discharge and epistaxis. Fifty‐five percent (n = 10) of dogs presented with epistaxis. Clinical signs were reported 2 months to 3 years (mean 8 months) prior to the surgery. Surgery was the sole treatment for 83% of dogs while 3 had radiotherapy and surgery. All dogs had blood analysis before surgery including haematology, biochemistry and coagulation times. One dog had planned auto‐transfusion after surgery. CT imaging was performed in 94% (n = 17) of dogs, one had rhinoscopy. Dorsal rhinotomy was performed in all dogs without serious complications excluding one dog that required blood transfusiion after surgery. Nasal packing was placed and left for 24 hours. Most of the dogs developed mild to moderate facial emphysema and nasal discharge which resolved within two or three weeks.</p>
