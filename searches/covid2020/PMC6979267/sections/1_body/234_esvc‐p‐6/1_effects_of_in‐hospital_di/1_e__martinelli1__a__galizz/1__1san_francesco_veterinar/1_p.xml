<p>Critically hill patients with acute congestive heart failure (CHF) may often show haemoconcentration, dysnatremia, dyskalemia and increased azotemia, due to aggressive diuretic therapy. Haemoconcentration is associated with lower risk of mortality, while dysnatremia and dyskalemia are associated with higher mortality in human medicine. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the impact of in‐hospital diuretic therapy for CHF on selected laboratory parameters and long‐term mortality.</p>
