<p>Stepwise backward regression demonstrated haemoconcentration (HR 0.33) and disnatremia (HR 2.85) influence over outcome. Statistically significant correlation (Pearson) was seen between furosemide dose and kalemia (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.32, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.014) and between BUN and sCr (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.27, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.021). No correlation was seen between furosemide dose and the variables sCr, BUN, Htc and between sCr and Htc.
