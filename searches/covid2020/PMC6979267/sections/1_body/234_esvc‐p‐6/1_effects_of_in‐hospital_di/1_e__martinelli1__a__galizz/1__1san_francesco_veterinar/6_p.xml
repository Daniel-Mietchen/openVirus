<p>In conclusion, haemoconcentration and disnatremia affected the outcome in dogs with CHF. Haemoconcentration was associated with lower risk of mortality and had to be considered a target in CHF therapy. In‚Äêhospital diuretic therapy increased electrolyte disorder due to loop diuretics inhibition of the renal Na, K, Cl cotransporter in the Henle's loop and disnatremia was a risk factor for adverse outcome. Diuretics doses and haemoconcentration didn't play a direct role in inducing renal disfunction.</p>
