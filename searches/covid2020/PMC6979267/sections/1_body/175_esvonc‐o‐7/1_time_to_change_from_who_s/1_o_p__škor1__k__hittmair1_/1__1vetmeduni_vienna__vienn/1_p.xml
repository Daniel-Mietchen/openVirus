<p>Ann Arbor system (AAS) remains the best anatomic staging of human diffuse large B‚Äêcell lymphoma (DLBCL). AAS divides patients into four stages based on localized disease (I), multiple nodal sites on one side (II), disseminated nodal disease on both sides of diaphragm (III), and in other extranodal sites (IV). In comparison to the veterinary WHO staging system (WHOS) AAS considers a splenic infiltration as nodal involvement, but not as a higher stage.</p>
