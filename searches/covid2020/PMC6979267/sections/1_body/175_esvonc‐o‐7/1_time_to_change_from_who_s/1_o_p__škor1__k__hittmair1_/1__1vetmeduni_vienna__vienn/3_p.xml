<p>There were nine stage III, 28 stage IV, and 17 stage V cases in WHOS, and 23 stage III, and 31 stage IV cases in AAS. No association between WHOS and grade, substage, B‐symptoms and treatment response were found. Higher AAS stage was associated with substage B (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03) and B‐symptoms (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and negatively with treatment response (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Higher AAS decreased progression free survival (PFS) (116 vs. 332 days, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and lymphoma specific survival (LSS) (180 vs. 489 days, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Higher WHOS showed a tendency toward shorter PFS (135 vs. 180 vs. 380 days, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.36) and LSS (194 vs. 250 vs. 396 days, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.43). In conclusion, AAS could predict more accurately prognosis in canine nodal DLBCL. Prospective studies assessing AAS in larger cohort of patients with standardized staging and in other lymphoma types are warranted.
