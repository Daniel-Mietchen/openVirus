<p>Canine diabetes mellitus (DM) can be classified as insulin resistance or insulin deficiency diabetes, with all cases requiring daily insulin injections to control hyperglycaemia. A number of pathological mechanisms are thought to lead to the development of the disease, including immune‐mediated destruction of beta cells. Disease risk differs considerably between breeds, suggesting that genetic factors are involved, but environmental triggers are also thought to play a role. In human Type 1 DM, the region of the genome containing the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) MHC class II genes confers approximately 50% of the genetic risk. Associations with dog leucocyte antigen (DLA) class II haplotypes have also been identified in diabetic dogs, but investigations to date have considered all breeds together. This study aimed to identify breed‐specific diabetes‐associated DLA haplotypes in an expanded data set. Taking the 18 most highly represented breeds in our previous study, we increased the DLA‐typing data from 294 to 736 diabetic dogs and from 501 to 1083 breed‐matched non‐diabetic controls to enable breed‐specific statistical analysis.</p>
