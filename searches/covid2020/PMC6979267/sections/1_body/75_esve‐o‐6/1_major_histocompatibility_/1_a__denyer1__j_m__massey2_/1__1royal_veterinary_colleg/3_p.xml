<p>Five breeds were identified as having one or more DLA haplotypes that were significantly different between DM cases and controls. These breeds were Bichon Frise (one risk haplotype, OR = 4.41); Labrador Retriever (one risk haplotype, OR = 1.60); Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (one risk haplotype, OR = 2.73); Cocker Spaniel (one risk haplotype, OR = 6.31 and one protective haplotype, OR = 0.30); Border Terrier (one protective haplotype, OR = 0.21). Combined analysis of all samples identified four DM‐associated haplotypes: one risk and three protective, including one protective DLA‐DQ haplotype identified in the previous study.</p>
