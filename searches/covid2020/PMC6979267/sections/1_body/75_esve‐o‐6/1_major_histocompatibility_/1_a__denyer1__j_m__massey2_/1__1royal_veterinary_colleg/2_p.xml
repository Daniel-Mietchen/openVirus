<p>Dogs were genotyped for DLA‐DRB1, −DQA1 and ‐DQB1 using sequence‐based typing of DNA (extracted from blood surplus to diagnostic requirements). The study population only included dogs from the UK. Female entire cases, expected to have dioestrus diabetes, were excluded. In all breeds, there were at least ten cases and the number of controls was equal to or greater than the number of cases. Genotypes from all three loci were combined to identify DLA class II haplotypes affecting risk of DM across each breed individually and all breeds together (
