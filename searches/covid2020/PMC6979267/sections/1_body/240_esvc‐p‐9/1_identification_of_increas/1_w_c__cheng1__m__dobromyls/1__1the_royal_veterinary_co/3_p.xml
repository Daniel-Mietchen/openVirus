<p>On immunoblotting, only one control had a recorded age (5.8 yrs), the other controls were documented as young adult. The median age of HCM cats was 8 yrs (1.7‐17). The protein level of desmin was 0.54 (0.27‐0.69) in the controls and 1.41 (0.59‐2.19) in the HCM group (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0159). The protein level of αB‐crystallin was 0.56 (0.18‐0.66) in the controls and was 1.46 (0.63‐2.39) in the HCM group (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0317). The protein expression of αB‐crystallin and desmin was highly correlated (R = 0.8788, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0016). On immunohistochemistry, the median age was 3 yrs (1.6‐5.8) in control cats and 8.5 (2‐17.9) in the HCM group (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). In controls, desmin appeared as stripes at Z‐bands and intercalated discs and a scarce amount of perinuclear aggregates were observed in the cross‐section of cardiomyocytes close to epicardium. In HCM cats, dissociation of desmin from the intercalated discs was a frequent finding and clumps of aggregates were seen in the transversely sectioned cardiomyocytes not limited to the periphery of epicardium. Averaged mean intensity of fluorescence was 95.2 (76.6‐116.3) in the HCM group and 70.7 (64.7‐81.1) in the control group (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0056).
