<p>Desmin, the intermediate filament (IF) in cardiomyocytes is critical for maintaining architecture and mechanical integrity of the contracting cell. Aggregation of desmin and impairment of protein quality control systems including heat shock proteins (HSP) which governs correct IF protein folding are reported in humans and rodent models with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Incorrect folding of desmin leads to its aberrant accumulation within cardiomyocytes. This study aimed to characterise the expression and localisation of desmin, and its chaperone the HSP αB‐crystallin in feline HCM.</p>
