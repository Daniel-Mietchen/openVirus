<p>Residual left ventricular (LV) tissues from necropsy (5 normal and 5 HCM cats) were used for immunoblotting of desmin and αB‐crystallin normalised to GAPDH. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry was performed on transverse sections of formalin‐fixed and paraffin‐embedded LV from another 4 normal and 8 HCM cats. A minimum of 10 images were captured under 40x magnification (5 longitudinal and 5 transverse) were used for fluorescence quantification and protein localisation. Diagnoses were made by histopathology ± clinical assessment. Mann‐Whitney's 
 <italic>U</italic> test, or Spearman's rho test were used and the results were expressed as median (range).
