<p>To determine how accurately and precisely insulin doses are delivered, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 U doses were dispensed 25 times from five SoloSTAR® containing insulin glargine, five FlexPen® containing insulin detemir, five KwikPen® containing insulin lispro, five JuniorSTAR® containing insulin glargine, five VetPen® 0.5‐8 U and five VetPen® 1‐16 U containing insulin Caninsulin®, and by five veterinarians using 30 U/0.3 mL and 40 U/mL insulin syringes. Each dose was weighed immediately using a precision balance (resolution of 0.00001 g), and the intended and delivered doses were compared.</p>
