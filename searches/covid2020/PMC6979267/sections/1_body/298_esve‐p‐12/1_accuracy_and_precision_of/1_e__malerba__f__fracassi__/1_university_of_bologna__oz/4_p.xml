<p>All devices, with the exception of JuniorSTAR and VetPen 0.5‐8 U, are unacceptably inaccurate when delivering 0.5, 1, and 2 U doses of insulin. The accuracy improves when higher doses are dispensed, but the delivery of 8 and 16 U doses resulted sufficiently accurate compared to intended doses only using 40 U/mL syringes. In conclusion, if pen‐injectors tend to be more accurate at lower dosages, syringes tend to be more accurate at higher dosages.</p>
