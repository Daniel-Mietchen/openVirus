<p>All pen‐injectors tended to deliver less insulin than the intended dose, underdosage being inversely proportional to dose (accuracy from −6.86% to −0.84%). The differences between intended and delivered dose were not significant only using JuniorSTAR and VetPen 0.5‐8 U at insulin dosage of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 U. Using 30 U/0.3 mL insulin syringes the intended dose was significantly overdosed when attempting to deliver 0.5, 1 and 2 U (+26.51%, +10.32% and + 3.26%, respectively), and significantly underdosed at 8 and 16 U (−3.44% and − 4.46%, respectively). Using 40 U/mL syringes the intended dose was significantly overdosed when attempting to deliver 0.5, 1 and 2 U (+30.77%, +5.63% and + 2.84%, respectively). With all six pen‐injectors and with both 30 U/0.3 mL and 40 U/mL insulin syringes, the coefficient of variation (precision) diminished with increasing doses of insulin. Precision was &lt;8% for all six pen‐injectors (from 7.67% to 0.69%). Conversely, precision using 30 U/0.3 mL and 40 U/mL syringes at insulin dosage of 0.5 U was 12.08% and 9.39%, respectively; precision improves at insulin dosages ≥1 U (from 5.80% to 0.46%).</p>
