<p>In this study, we evaluated the response of 15 dogs with a CE to a commercially available dietetic food (Hill's Prescription Diet i/d Sensitive Canine Dry). The dogs underwent a standard diagnostic evaluation, and did not receive concurrent anthelmintics, antibiotic, glucocorticoid or gastroprotectant therapies. The clinical efficacy of the dietary treatment was assessed by comparing the Canine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity Index (CIBDAI) before and a median of 13â€‰days after dietary therapy.</p>
