<p>Chronic Enteropathies (CE) are a common cause of morbidity in dogs. Chronic enteropathies are diagnosed in dogs with chronic gastrointestinal clinical signs (&gt;3 weeks), inflammatory changes on intestinal biopsies and where no other underlying cause is determined based on a thorough, standardised diagnostic workup. Based on response to therapy, CE are sub‐classified into food‐responsive, antibiotic‐responsive or steroid‐responsive enteropathies. A significant proportion of dogs with a CE are food‐responsive; however, there are limited peer‐reviewed publications describing the clinical efficacy of the commercially available food used to treat CE.</p>
