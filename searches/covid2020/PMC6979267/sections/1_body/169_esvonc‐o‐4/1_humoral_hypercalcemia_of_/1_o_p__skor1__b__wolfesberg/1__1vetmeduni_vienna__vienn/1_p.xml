<p>Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is a common paraneoplastic syndrome in canine lymphoma and has always been considered a negative prognostic factor. However, studies analyzing the role of HHM in WHO lymphoma types are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of HHM among different lymphoma types and its prognostic impact on survival. In a retrospective study data of dogs diagnosed with untreated lymphoma between 2008 and 2019 were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were availability of WHO type and serum/plasma calcium concentration.</p>
