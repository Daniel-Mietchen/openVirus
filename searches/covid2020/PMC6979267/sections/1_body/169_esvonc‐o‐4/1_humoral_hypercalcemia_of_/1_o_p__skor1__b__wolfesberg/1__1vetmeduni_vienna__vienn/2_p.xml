<p>139 cases were included. HHM was present in 14/139 (10%) patients. Most notably only patients with T‐lymphomas were affected. 9/14 (64%) suffered from peripheral T‐cell lymphoma (PTLC) and 5/14 (36%) from T‐lymphoblastic lymphoma (T‐LBL). HHM occurred in 43% (9/21) of PTLC and 38% (5/13) of T‐LBL cases. 86% of patients with HHM showed symptoms attributable to hypercalcemia, predominantly polyuria/polydipsia, neurological (somnolence, weakness), and gastrointestinal manifestation (inappetence). In dogs with HHM, median total and ionized calcium were 3.81 mmol/l (reference interval 2.4‐3.0) and 1.8 mmol/l (reference interval 1.25‐1.5), respectively. Under chemotherapy calcium concentration returned to normal in 93% of cases. No significant differences in progression free survival (150 vs. 60 days, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.29) or lymphoma specific survival (170 vs. 135 days, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.42) were observed between hypercalcemic and normocalcemic dogs of both subtypes. According to our results, HHM is not an unfavorable prognostic factor but it is associated with aggressive T‐cell lymphoma types. Prospective studies assessing the role of vitamin D3, PTHrP and PTH in HHM are warranted.
