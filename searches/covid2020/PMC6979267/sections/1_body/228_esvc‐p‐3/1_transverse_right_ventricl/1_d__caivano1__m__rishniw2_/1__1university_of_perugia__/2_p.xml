<p>We acquired 2D echocardiographic cineloops from the left apical 4‐chamber view optimized for the right ventricle and analyzed transverse RV free wall strain and strain rate in 74 dogs (40 healthy dogs and 34 dogs with pulmonary hypertension) using Xstrain® software. Dogs were classified as having pulmonary hypertension based on the TR jet velocity (&gt; 3 m/sec). We classified dogs as having moderate pulmonary hypertension if TR velocity &gt; 3.5 m/sec, and severe pulmonary hypertension if TR velocity &gt; 4.5 m/sec.</p>
