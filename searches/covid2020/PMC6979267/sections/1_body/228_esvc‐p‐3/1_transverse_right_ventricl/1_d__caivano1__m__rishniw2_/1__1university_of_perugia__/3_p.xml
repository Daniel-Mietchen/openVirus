<p>Seven dogs (3 healthy and 4 dogs with pulmonary hypertension) were excluded during the analysis for low quality images. In healthy dogs, strain and strain rate showed no relationship with heart rate, body weight or age. In dogs with pulmonary hypertension, strain and strain rate showed weak negative relationships with TR velocity (
 <italic>r2</italic> = 0.25), but no relationship with left atrial size (
 <italic>r2</italic> = 0.05). Although transverse RV strain (but not strain rate) showed a negative relationship with class of pulmonary hypertension, it was not useful in identifying dogs with pulmonary hypertension.
