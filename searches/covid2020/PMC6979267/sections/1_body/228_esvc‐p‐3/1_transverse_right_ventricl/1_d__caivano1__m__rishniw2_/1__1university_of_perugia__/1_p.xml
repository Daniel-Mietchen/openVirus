<p>Right ventricular (RV) strain analysis using 2‐dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography has focused on assessing longitudinal strain and strain rate variables in dogs. However, RV contraction is also characterized by transverse deformation; this strain component has not been investigated in dogs. Therefore, we evaluated the ability of transverse RV strain and strain rate, obtained by 2‐dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography in healthy dogs and dogs with pulmonary hypertension, to identify dogs with pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, we examined relationships of transverse strain and strain rate variables with heart rate, age and bodyweight in healthy dogs, and with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity and left atrial size in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.</p>
