<p>The binding capacity of human sera for thyroxine is such that, in the absence of conditions that would reduce thyroid binding capacity (TBC), e.g., non‐thyroidal illness (NTI), pregnancy or free fatty acids, sera may be diluted more than 100‐fold without affecting the measured result for Free T4 using an appropriate analytical technique such as equilibrium dialysis. However, in conditions associated with reduced TBC, results may decrease at dilutions as low as 1:10. Free T4 dilution profiles have been used to determine the validity of free T4 methods for humans.</p>
