<p>Percentage decreases could not be calculated for all samples because of the reporting limits of the assays. However, in all samples, there was a decrease in FT4d between 20 and 32% at the 1:10 dilution which compared to decrease of 59 to 79% by VF4 at the same dilution for samples in which percentage decrease could be calculated. The steepest decline in concentration beyond 1:10 was in the suspected feline NTI sample and the least decline in the normal cat.</p>
