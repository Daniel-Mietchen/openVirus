<p>Surplus serum samples from dogs and cats in a selection of physiological states were analysed by an equilibrium dialysis method (FT4 by equilibrium dialysis, Antech Laboratories (FT4d)) and an analogue chemiluminescent method (Immulite 2000 Veterinary Free T4, Siemens (VF4)) with and without dilution in HEPES buffer at 1:2, 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80. Samples included: normal cat (TT4 = 11.8â€‰nmoL/L), hyperthyroid cat (TT4 = 104), suspected canine NTI (TT4 = 12.8, normal TSH), suspected feline NTI (TT4 = 40, FT4d = 112), feline lipaemia (TT4 = 52).</p>
