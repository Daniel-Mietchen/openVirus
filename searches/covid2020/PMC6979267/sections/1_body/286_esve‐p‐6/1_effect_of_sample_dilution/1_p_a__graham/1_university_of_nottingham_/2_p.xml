<p>In dogs and cats, TBC is much lower and it is not clear what the equivalent dilution would be that would cause a decrease in measured Free T4. The analytical impact of physiological states including NTI have not been investigated. Analytical methods which are less resistant to the effects of sample dilution may be more susceptible to interference from lowered TBC (eg., NTI) and consequently may generate diagnostically misleading results.</p>
