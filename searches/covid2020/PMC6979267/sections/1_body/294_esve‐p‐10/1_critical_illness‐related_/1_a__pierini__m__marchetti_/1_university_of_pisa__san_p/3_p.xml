<p>A single‐center prospective study was performed between December 2016 and May 2017 (ethical approval n°63 711/2016). SIRS was diagnosed if dogs presented at least two of the following criteria at the admission in ICU: 1) rectal temperature &gt; 39.0°C or &lt; 38.0°C; 2) heart rate &gt; 120 bpm; 3) respiratory rate &gt; 20 bpm; 4) white blood cells &lt;6 x 10
 <sup>3</sup>/μL or &gt; 16 x 10
 <sup>3</sup>/μL or &gt; 3% of band neutrophils. Dogs were excluded if they have a history of or suspected adrenal illness or if they received glucocorticoids within the previous 72 hours or long acting formulations within the previous month or other drugs known to affect the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis.
