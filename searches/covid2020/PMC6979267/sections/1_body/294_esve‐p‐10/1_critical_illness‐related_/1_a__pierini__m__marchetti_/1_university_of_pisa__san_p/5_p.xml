<p>Twenty‐one dogs met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. CIRCI and hypotension was detected in 10/21 (48%) and 7/21 (33%) dogs, respectively. Age, MAP, basal cortisol and hypotension were similar between dogs with or without CIRCI. 14/21 dogs (67%) died within 28 days from admission. As independent factor, hypotension and basal hypercortisolemia were associated with higher risk of death (
