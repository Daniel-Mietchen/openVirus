<p>ACTH stimulation test was performed in all dogs immediately after inclusion in the study and dogs with a Δ cortisol (difference between post‐ACTH stimulation and basal cortisol) ≤3 μg/dL supported diagnosis of CIRCI. Non‐invasive blood pressure (petMAP™graphic II, Ramsey Medical) was measured in all dogs and hypotension was defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt;60 mmHg. Information about survival at 28 days after admission were collected. Dogs were divided into survivors and non‐survivors. Dogs that were euthanized for financial reasons were excluded. D'Agostino‐Pearson's test tested data for normality. Age, basal cortisol and MAP were compared between dogs with or without CIRCI. Δ cortisol, basal cortisol and MAP were compared between survivors and non‐survivors using 
 <italic>t</italic>‐test. Association between CIRCI, hypotension and mortality were evaluated with Fisher's exact test. For all analyses, a P‐value ≤0.05 was considered significant.
