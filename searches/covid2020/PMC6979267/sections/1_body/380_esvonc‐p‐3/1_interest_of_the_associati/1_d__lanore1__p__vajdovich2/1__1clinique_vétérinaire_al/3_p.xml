<p>A complete clinical staging was prospectively performed in 76 dogs (examined in 9 oncology referral centers) with a confirmed diagnosis of a nodal DLBCL. Liver ultrasound, cytology and plasma ALT measurements were performed for each dog. The ultrasonographic patterns characteristic for canine lymphoma in liver included coarse parenchyma, ill‐defined hypoechoic areas, hypoechoic nodules, diffuse hypoechogenicity, and diffuse hyperechogenicity with or without hepatomegaly (Nyland 1984, Crabtree 2010). ALT analysis was performed in‐house, and results were interpreted against each laboratory‐specific reference ranges and classified as normal vs elevated. Ethics approval was granted by Royal Canin's Ethical Committee.</p>
