<p>Twenty‐nine cats (46%) showed anemia which was more frequently mild (Hct &lt; 26%; 62.1%) or moderate (13% &lt; Hct &lt; 19%; 31%), normocytic‐normochromic (72.4%), and non‐regenerative (86.2%). Microcytosis was an infrequent finding (6.3%), and only two cats had microcytosis, anemia and hypoferremia concurrently. Hypoferremia (serum iron &lt;90 mcg/dL) was present in 34 cats and concurrent anemia was observed in 15 cats (without any association between these two parameters). Both hypoferremia and anemia were more severe in group A (median serum iron 60 mcg/dL; mean RBC 6.06 M/μL; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0321) than group B (median serum iron 90.5 mcg/dL; mean RBC 7.00 M/μL). Moreover, anemia was more frequently present in group A (63%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0321). A ROC curve was used to determine the optimal cut‐off of serum iron to identify cats with hepato‐pancreatic and intestinal involvement. Cats with serum iron lower than 61.5 mcg/dL were more frequently belonging to group A (sensitivity 82.2%; specificity 52.6%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0048).
