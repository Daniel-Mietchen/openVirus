<p>In conclusion, the GLP‐1 analogue EER leads to a reduction in GV and better glycemic control in cats with DM. Furthermore, lower GV is associated with higher remission rates in cats treated with EER. The results of this study therefore suggest that adding a GLP‐1 analogue to the conventional therapy may be advantageous in the treatment of cats with DM.</p>
