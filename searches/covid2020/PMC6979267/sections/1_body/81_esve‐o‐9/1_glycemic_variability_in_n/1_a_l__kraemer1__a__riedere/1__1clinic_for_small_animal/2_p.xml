<p>In humans with diabetes mellitus (DM), adding a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) analogue to the conventional therapy results in significant reduction in GV. In cats knowledge on GV is scarce and the influence of different treatment modalities has not been studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate GV in cats receiving the GLP‐1 analogue exenatide extended‐release (EER) additionally to insulin therapy. Blood glucose curves from a recent prospective placebo‐controlled clinical trial were evaluated for GV 1, 3, 6, 10 and 16 weeks after starting therapy. Cats were treated with EER (200 μg/kg) or 0.9% saline, administered subcutaneously, once weekly. Both groups received insulin glargine twice daily and a low‐carbohydrate diet.</p>
