<p>Tissue samples of follicular type (n = 1) and compact type (n = 1) FTCs derived from two euthyroid dogs were frozen in DMSO‐containing freezing medium within 24 h of thyroidectomy and stored at −150°C until processing. After thawing, the tissue was digested with collagenase IV and dissociated mechanically. Cells were subsequently seeded in Cultrex® Basement Membrane Extract and cultured to organoids in Advanced DMEM supplemented with N‐acetylcysteine, B‐27 supplement, EGF, Noggin, Rspondin‐1 and Rock‐inhibitor. Organoids were split and passaged every 9 to 14 days. After 15 to 24 days, organoids were formalin‐fixed, pelleted in 2.5% agarose, paraffin‐embedded and processed for hematoxylin‐eosin staining. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for thyroid transcription factor‐1 (TTF‐1), thyroglobulin (Tg), calcitonin, vimentin and Ki‐67 was performed on sections of the primary tumors and organoids.</p>
