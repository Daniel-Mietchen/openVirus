<p>Nuclear expression of TTF‐1 in both organoid lines confirmed thyroid origin. The organoids derived from the compact FTC, which had approximately 30% of cells positive to Tg, showed no Tg expression while the organoids derived from the follicular FTC, which had Tg expression in &gt;95% of cells, showed Tg expression in about 50% of the organoids. Vimentin expression was observed in both organoid lines (30‐60% of cells) and was higher than in the primary tumors, where only up to 10% of tumor cells were positive. IHC for calcitonin and Ki‐67 was negative in both organoid lines.</p>
