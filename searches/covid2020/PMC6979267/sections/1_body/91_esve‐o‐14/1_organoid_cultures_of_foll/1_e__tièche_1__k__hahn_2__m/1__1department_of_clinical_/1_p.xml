<p>Growing patient‐derived tissue in 3‐dimensional cell culture systems (organoids) has revolutionized 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cancer research. In contrast to 2‐D cell lines, organoids can be grown more efficiently and conserve important features of the original tumor, such as tissue architecture and cellular heterogeneity. In human medicine, organoid cultures provide a unique platform for personalized cancer therapy. In this study, we aimed to culture and characterize organoids derived from follicular‐cell thyroid carcinoma (FTC) in dogs.
