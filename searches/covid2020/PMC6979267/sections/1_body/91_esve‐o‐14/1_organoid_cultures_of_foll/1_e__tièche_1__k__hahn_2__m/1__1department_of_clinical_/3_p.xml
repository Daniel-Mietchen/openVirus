<p>Organoids of FTC were cultured efficiently using our protocol. Organoids of both tumors formed follicle‚Äêlike structures composed of a single epithelial cell layer. These epithelial cells were round to cuboidal, had variably distinct cell borders and abundant eosinophilic to foamy cytoplasm. Anisocytosis and anisokaryosis were not observed in either of the organoid lines but were present in the FTC of compact type.</p>
