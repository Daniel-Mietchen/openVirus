<p>Leishmaniasis a zoonosis caused by 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp., is a chronic and often fatal disease for humans and dogs if left untreated. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small, single‐stranded non‐coding RNAs able to regulate gene expression have been shown to play a critical role in the development and function of immune responses. While in circulation, free‐serum miRNAs are highly degradable, when transported in mycelial vesicles (exosomes) they become stable (protected from RNAse degradation) and reliable diagnostic biomarker in diseased patients. In 2013, using murine animal the role played by exosomes and miRNAs was explored during Leishmania infection; a reduction in the activity of miR‐122, the most abundant miRNA present in the liver tissue, was obtained. Very little is known about the role of exosomal miRNA in canine leishmaniasis (CL); in particular, the interaction between exosomal miR‐122 and lipid alterations. The aim of this study was 3fold: 1) isolate/characterize exosomes in canine serum obtained from 6 healthy dogs; 2) evaluate their quality/quantity of exosomal miRNAs and proteins; 3) evaluate the expression of serum exosomal miR‐122 in 10 healthy dogs and 10 leishmaniotic dogs.
