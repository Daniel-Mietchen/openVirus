<p>This is the first study showing the detection of circulating serum exosomes content of miR122 in in dogs affected by CL. Serum exosomes of 30‐130 nm in diameter containing miR‐122 and RNU6‐2 miRNAs were isolated. A concentration of 12 ng/μL of miRNAs and 10 μg/μL of proteins were recovered. Albumin and HDL were decreased whereas total proteins and LDL were significantly increased in affected compared to healthy dogs. As shown in an experimental study performed in mice, a significant decreased expression of miR‐122‐5p was seen in leishmania infected dogs compared with healthy ones.</p>
