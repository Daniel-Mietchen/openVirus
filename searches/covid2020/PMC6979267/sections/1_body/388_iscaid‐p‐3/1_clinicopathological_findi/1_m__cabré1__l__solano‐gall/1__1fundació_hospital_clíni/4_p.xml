<p>Most dogs studied were classified as moderate clinical stage of canine leishmaniosis (70.2%). Young dogs have less tendency to develop systemic signs (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0059), renal (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0015) and hematologic (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0267) abnormalities, while dermatologic signs appear to be more common in young dogs compared with old ones (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0451). Young dogs showed proteinuria less often than older dogs (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0029). Dogs younger than 3 years did not present renal azotemia, while older dogs showed occasionally renal azotemia (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0284). Younger dogs were mainly classified as Stage I or II‐mild‐moderate disease, and very rarely as Stage III or IV‐ severe or very severe disease, compared with dogs older than 3 years old (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0153). Pure breed dogs seem to have significantly more tendency to develop ulcerative dermatitis compared to mixed breed dogs (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0460).
