<p>Re‐irradiation is getting a more recognized treatment option in patients with recurrent neoplastic disease. However, information about efficacy and risk for chronic side effects is limited in veterinary medicine. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcome and reported late side effects in dogs and cats receiving re‐irradiation because of progressive tumor recurrence. Small animal cancer patients treated with re‐irradiation between 2006‐2017 were included into this retrospective study. Patient characteristics, tumor type and localization, pretreatment, time interval between initial radiotherapy and re‐irradiation, radiation protocols, late side effects, cause of death and survival times were analyzed. Forty‐nine patients (27 dogs, 22 cats) were included into this study and the majority of them suffered from head‐and neck tumors (61%). Re‐irradiation protocols were ‐ with one exception ‐palliative and five animals received a second course of re‐irradiation. Fifteen patients were initially radiated definitively and 34 animals with palliative intent. Mean time interval between initial radiotherapy and first re‐irradiation was 264 days and between first and second re‐irradiation 207 days. Mean total biologic‐effective‐dose for late responding tissue (BED
 <sub>3</sub>) was 126 Gy for initial radiotherapy and re‐irradiation. Late side effects were most commonly observed in skin/hair but always scored as mild (score 1, VRTOG). Chronic ocular side effects were reported in seven patients (score 1‐3). Median tumor‐specific survival time of all patients was 529 days. In conclusion, this study demonstrate that palliative re‐irradiation can be offered as treatment option for incurable recurrent tumors. Late side effects were mostly mild and not life‐threatening.
