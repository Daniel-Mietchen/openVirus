<p>The present study described the successful treatment of ISPS and DCRV in 4 dogs by CB dilation with a PGmax reduction of 51.06% and reverse right atrioventricular remodelling at T1. The procedure could not be completed in 1 dog and 2 cats probably because of their small body size and/or their severe RA remodelling which impeded us to advace the stiff CB on the softer guide. These preliminary results indicate a possible application of CB dilation in the treatment of ISIP and DCRV.</p>
