<p>Subvalvular pulmonic stenosis (SPS) is classified into two subtypes: infundibular (ISPS) and sub‐infundibular (SISPS). ISPS can be primary, due to fixed obstruction of the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract, or secondary to right ventricular concentric hypertrophy caused by pulmonic stenosis. Furthermore, SISPS is also defined as double chambered right ventricle (DCRV), a high‐pressure superior chamber and a low‐pressure inferior chamber. The aim of the study was to describe the treatment of ISPS and DCRV in dogs and cats with a the cutting balloon (CB) technique.</p>
