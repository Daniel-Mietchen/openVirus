<p>The mean diameter of the stenosis was 6,4 (±1,54) mm for the dogs and 2,1 (±0,14) mm for the cats. At T0 mean Vmax was 5.3 ± 0.9 m/s, mean PGmax was 117.07 ± 40.3 mmHg, mean TRV max was 5.23 ± 0,63 m/s, mean RA area was 599 ± 1225.5 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, mean TAPSE was 11.54 ± 4.39 mm, mean TDI was 0.11 ± 0.007 m/s and mean FAC was 42.16 ± 16.1%. Mean pressure values measured by catheterisation before the procedure were: RA pressure 7.3 ± 1.8 mmHg, RV superior chamber 92.66 ± 40.45 mmHg; RV inferior chamber 34.33 ± 12.09 mmHg. CB dilation could not be completed in 1/5 dogs and 2/2 cats. During the dilation mean RV superior chamber pressure was 60.33 ± 13.42 mmHg. Follow‐up at T1 was available for 4/4 treated dogs and at T2 was available for 3/4 treated dogs. Following CB dilation mean RV superior chamber pressure was reduced by 31,5%, whilst mean PGmax was reduced by 51.06%.
