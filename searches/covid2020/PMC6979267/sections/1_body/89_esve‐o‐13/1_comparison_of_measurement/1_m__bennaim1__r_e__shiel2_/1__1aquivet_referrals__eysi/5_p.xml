<p>Considering the lack of agreement observed, fT4a and fT4d cannot be used interchangeably. As opposed to fT4d, fT4a provided no more diagnostic information than that gained by measurement of total T4 in dogs with NTI. Based on these results, fT4a cannot be recommended to differentiate NTI from hypothyroidism in dogs with a low total T4 concentration. This represents the population in which measurement of free T4 concentration is most commonly recommended.</p>
