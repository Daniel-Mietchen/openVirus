<p>Initially fT4a concentrations were measured in surplus serum samples from 150 dogs with various NTIs in which hypothyroidism was not suspected. Total T4 concentration (Immulite Canine Total T4, Siemens) and fT4d (Free T4 by Equilibrium Dialysis, Antech Laboratories) were subsequently measured in a subpopulation of 75 dogs selected with a range of fT4a concentrations. Reference intervals were 7.7 to 47.6 PMol/L, 7.0 to 40.0 PMol/L and 15.0 to 50.0 nmol/L for fT4a, fT4d and total T4, respectively. The Kruskal Wallis or chi‐squared tests were used for statistical analysis, as appropriate.</p>
