<p>Twenty dogs diagnosed with CE were included in this study; all showed persistent gastrointestinal signs, no response to conventional treatment (diet, antibiotics and/or immunosupressors/immunomodulators administration) and histopathological evidence of intestinal inflammation. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Extremadura. A single dose of canine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of allogeneic adipose origin at 2‐4 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per kilogram of weight was parenterally administered. A blood sample was obtained prior MSCs administration and subsequent cobalamin checkups were performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months; blood samples were submitted to a reference laboratory (Laboklin, Madrid, Spain). Clinical improvement was assessed at the same time points by the Clinical Activity Index (CIBDAI; clinically normal &lt;3). The data were analyzed using a Saphiro‐Wilk test and a repeated measures One‐Way ANOVA followed by a Dunns or a Holm Sidak post‐hoc test; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered as significant and results are expressed as mean ± SE of the mean. At the beginning of the study, 75% of dogs (15/20) presented hypocobalaminaemia (&lt;300 pg/ml; laboratorial reference value). Statistically significant differences were observed between pre‐treatment cobalamin values (225.3 ± 26 pg/ml) and those analyzed at 3 (360.7 ± 33.5 pg/ml), 6 (423 ± 55.7 pg/ml) and 12 (602.6 ± 54 pg/ml) months of treatment (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were observed between pretreatment values and those obtained after one month of MSCs administration (299.2 ± 41 pg/ml). The CIBDAI significantly improved at all the checkups ranging from 8.2 ± 0.6 (pre‐treatment) to 0.7 ± 0.3 (twelve months). CIBDAI was &lt;3 for all groups treated with MSCs.
