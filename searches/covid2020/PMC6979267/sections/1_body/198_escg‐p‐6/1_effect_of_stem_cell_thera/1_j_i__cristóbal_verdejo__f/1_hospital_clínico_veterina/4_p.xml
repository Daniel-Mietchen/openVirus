<p>Our results demonstrate that administration of MSCs leads to an increase in serum cobalamin in dogs diagnosed with CE. This increase is associated with an improvement of their clinical status and therefore, MSCs therapy should be considered for the treatment of dogs affected with CE due to their positive impact on the long‚Äêterm prognosis.
