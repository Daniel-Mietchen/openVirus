<p>Our results show that a majority of cell lines are not radiosensitized 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that the tumor microenvironment is responsible for the major effect of hyperthermia. Interestingly, we discovered a heat‚Äêinduced suppression of BRCA2 transcription, potentially inhibiting the homologous recombination repair pathway. This is promising in the light of future combination of hyperthermia with PARP inhibitors.
