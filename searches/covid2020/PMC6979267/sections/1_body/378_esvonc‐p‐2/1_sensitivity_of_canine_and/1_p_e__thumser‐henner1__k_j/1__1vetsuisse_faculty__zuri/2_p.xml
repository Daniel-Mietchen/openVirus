<p>Survival curves after treatment were determined in a panel of human and canine cancer cell lines using a clonogenic survival assay. We analyzed the effect of HT‐RT on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Further, we tested the influence of the HT‐RT time gap, different temperatures and order of the treatment, using A549 cells that are sensitized by hyperthermia as positive controls. Levels of HSP70 and the DNA repair protein RAD51 were analyzed in HT‐sensitive and ‐resistant cell lines by Western‐Blot. Knockdown of HSP70 was performed in A549 cells using siRNA against HSP70. Additionally, we evaluated mRNA levels of BRCA2 in an 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> canine tumor model (soft tissue sarcomas, carcinomas, mast cell tumors), and whether they were affected by hyperthermia. Out of eight cell lines tested, only A549 and Abrams cells showed significant decrease in clonogenic cell survival when pre‐treated with hyperthermia at 42°C. A549 showed high baseline levels of HSP70, which was further induced upon treatment. All other cell lines had low or non‐detectable baseline expression levels, but showed strong induction upon treatment. Levels of RAD51 were not affected. Additionally, HSP70 knockdown did not affect clonogenicity after HT‐RT. However, BRCA2 mRNA levels were lowered by heat, notably in 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> treated canine soft tissue sarcomas.
