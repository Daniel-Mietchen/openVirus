<p>Hyperthermia (41°C to 43°C) combined with radiotherapy (HT‐RT), or thermoradiotherapy, is used clinically in particular cases of human and canine cancer. Hyperthermia provokes changes at different levels: in the tumor microenvironment by increasing perfusion and oxygenation and inducing an immune response, in the tumor cells by induction of cell death and inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms. These changes increase the efficacy of radiation treatment towards a better tumor response. However, the molecular mechanisms of this cellular sensitization have not been fully elucidated. The aims of our study were firstly to screen human and canine cancer cell lines for their sensitivity towards hyperthermia‐radiotherapy treatment, and investigate the role of heat‐shock protein HSP70, and DNA repair proteins in the radiosensitization mechanism.</p>
