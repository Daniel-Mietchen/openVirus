<p>LB was discovered accidentally in three cases, presented to veterinarians for wellness exams and vaccinations. Clinical signs were apparent to the examining veterinarians but not to the owners. Orthopedic disorders were reported for 20/29 cases (69%). Four dogs (14%) showed only general signs of disease. Kidney failure occurred in four cases (14%); one dog (3%) died of a dilated cardiomyopathy and one suspicious dog presented barking troubles that responded well to doxycycline. Specific antibody levels against 
 <italic>Bb</italic> did not correlate with clinical signs and severity of the disease but were useful for the follow‐up checks. Furthermore, concurrent specific antibodies against 
 <italic>Bb</italic> and 
 <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> were detected in 5/29 cases (17%). Borrelial DNA was found in synovial fluid of four dogs with orthopedic disorders and from one heart sample. Recovery after antibiotic treatment was observed in all dogs with orthopedic or general disorders. Dogs with renal and cardiac manifestations showed a poor prognosis as the dog with cardiac presentation and 3/4 cases with kidney failure died. Application of parasiticides was not always recorded; 6/29 dogs (21%) did not receive regular treatment, 7/29 were treated regularly with isoxazoline systemic products (24%), 2/29 with fipronil‐based spot‐ons (7%) and 2/29 (7%) with collars (one flumethrin‐based and one unrecorded brand).
