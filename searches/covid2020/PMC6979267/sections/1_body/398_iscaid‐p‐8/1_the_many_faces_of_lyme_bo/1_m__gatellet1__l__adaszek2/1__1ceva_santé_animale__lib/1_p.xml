<p>Canine Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a disease common and well‐documented in the northeastern and midwestern parts of the USA, while in Europe the clinical presentation and the existence of the disease are controversially discussed. Fever and arthritis are clinical manifestations most often associated with LB; other presentations such as renal, cardiac, neurological, and muscular disorders are suspected to be sequelae of

 <italic>Bb</italic>) infection, but were not reproduced experimentally. The aim of this study was to document various presentations of canine LB in North America and Europe. Twenty‐nine dogs were included in this retrospective study based on clinical signs consistent with LB and at least positive antibody detection. Nineteen dogs lived in endemic areas in the USA, while 10 dogs resided in Europe. Medical records were available for 28 cases, and a phone contact with the owner and the attending veterinarian was established for the 29th case.
