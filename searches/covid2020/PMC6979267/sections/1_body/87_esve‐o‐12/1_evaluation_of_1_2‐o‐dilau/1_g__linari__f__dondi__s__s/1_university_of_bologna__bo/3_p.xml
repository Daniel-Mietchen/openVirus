<p>Left over samples used for diagnostic proposals and stored at −20°C were selected retrospectively, following stability period recommendations, and analyzed from 19, 21 and 23 dogs with hypercortisolism, AP and HD, respectively.

Diagnosis of hypercortisolism was performed combining more than 2 typical clinical signs with a positive specific endocrine test (ACTH stimulation test and/or LDDS test). Dogs with hypercortisolism were included only if they had absence of clinical and ultrasonographic signs suggestive of AP.

Data were expressed as median and (range) and compared using nonparametric statistics (P &lt; 0.05 considered significant).</p>
