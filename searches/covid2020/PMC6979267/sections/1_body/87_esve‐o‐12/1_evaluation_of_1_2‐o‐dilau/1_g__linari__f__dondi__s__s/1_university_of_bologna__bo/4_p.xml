<p>Median DGGRL concentration (U/L) was 234 (55‐874), 263 (37‐1768) and 44 (19‐209) in dogs with hypercortisolism, AP and in HD, respectively. Median TL concentration (U/L) was 416 (144‐1932), 469 (84‐3472) and 270 (58‐544) in dogs with hypercortisolism, AP and in HD, respectively. DGGRL and TL concentrations were significantly different among HD and the other two groups, but resulted not different between dogs with hypercortisolism and AP (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.58; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.74). DGGRL concentrations were above the reference interval (10‐130 U/L) in 63.2%, 66.6% and 8.7% dogs with hypercortisolism, AP and HD, respectively. TL concentrations were above the reference interval (70‐700 U/L) in 26.3%, 33.3% and 0% dogs with hypercortisolism, AP and in HD, respectively.
