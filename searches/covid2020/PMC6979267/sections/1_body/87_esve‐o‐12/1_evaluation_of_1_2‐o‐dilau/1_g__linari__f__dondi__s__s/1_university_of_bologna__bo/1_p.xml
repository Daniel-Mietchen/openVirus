<p>Canine pancreatic‐specific lipase (ScPL) is considered the most sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in dogs. However, relatively high costs and long turnaround times can limit everyday clinical use. Other more accessible serum assays are available for daily usage like 1,2diglyceride lipase assay (total lipase; TL) and 1,2‐o‐dilauryl‐rac‐glycero glutaric acid‐(6′‐methylresorufin) ester (DGGR) lipase assay (DGGRL). Recently a study compared ScPL to DGGRL obtaining a high agreement. For this reason DGGRL is actually widely used. A recent study observed that in 35% of dogs with hypercortisolism, ScPL concentrations were elevated (≥400 μg/L) resulting in false positive results for pancreatitis.</p>
