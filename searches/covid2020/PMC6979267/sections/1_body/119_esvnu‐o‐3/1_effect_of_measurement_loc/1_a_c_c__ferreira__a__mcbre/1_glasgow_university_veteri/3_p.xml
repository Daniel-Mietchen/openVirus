<p>Each dog had their BP measured using high definition oscillometry in 2 locations consecutively; for the 25 out‐patients, in the consult room with the owner and in a quiet room and for the 25 in‐patients, in their kennel and in a quiet room. The measurement location order was randomized. Blood pressure measurement methods were standardized and based on the ACVIM consensus statement and instrument manufacturer recommendations. The BP cuff was placed on the tail. All measurements were taken by a single veterinary surgeon using the same cuff and body position for each dog in both locations. The pulse waveform was visualized during measurement and 5 valid readings were collected and averaged in each location. Descriptive statistics were performed and the number of dogs with &gt;20% difference between locations was calculated. In addition, SBP was classified using ACVIM consensus statement hypertension categories.</p>
