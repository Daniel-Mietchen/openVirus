<p>Third degree atrioventricular block (AVB) is characterised by complete atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, causing independent atrial and ventricular rhythms. Persistent third degree AVB (PAVB) is most commonly described. Another form of AVB, where AV dissociation is intermittent (IAVB) is also recognised. In cats, AVB can be associated with underlying cardiac or systemic diseases. When present, clinical signs associated with these forms of AVB can include weakness, lethargy and syncope. If clinical signs and in particular syncope are present, epicardial pacemaker implantation represents an effective treatment. The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess presentation, echocardiographic data, comorbidities and outcome from cats diagnosed with AVB (PAVB or IAVB) in a single referral hospital, including those that underwent pacemaker implantation. Non parametric testing and Kaplan Meier curves with log rank testing were performed. Sixty‐four cats were included over a 12‐year period. Forty‐three cats had PAVB, 21 had IAVB. Median age of presentation was 13 years, with no difference between AVB type (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.752). Thirty‐five cats were male and 29 female. Forty‐four cats were referred for cardiac complaints (syncope, arrhythmia or dyspnoea), 8 cats had non‐specific signs (lethargy) and in 12 cats AVB was an incidental finding. Cats with IAVB were more likely to present with syncopal events (p = 0.005). The median duration of clinical signs prior to presentation was 21 days (1‐1138). Twenty‐nine cats had echocardiographic changes, left ventricular hypertrophy (17), chamber dilation (12); 13 cats presented with congestive heart failure (CHF). Forty‐five cats had one or more comorbidities, the most common were hyperthyroidism (16), diabetes mellitus (9), azotaemia (8). Fifteen cats underwent epicardial pacemaker implantation, mainly cats with IAVB (9/15). Five cats had minor complications (lead dislodgement, pacemaker undersensing, exit block) and 12 cats showed no further clinical signs since implantation. Forty‐seven cats died; all‐cause mortality median survival time was 799 days (0‐2965) and no difference in survival was observed in cats that presented with CHF (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.052), IAVB (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.082), had comorbidities (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.683) or pacemaker placement (p = 0.089). Death due to cardiac cause occurred in fewer cats (17/47), with shorter survival than all‐cause mortality (65 days, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003). CHF on presentation was associated with cardiac death (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The results of this study showed a variable outcome in cats with AVB. Cardiac death occurred in the minority of cat and was associated with CHF at presentation. Most cats have comorbidities, which did not affect all‐cause mortality. Pacemaker implant controlled clinical signs in the majority of cats.
