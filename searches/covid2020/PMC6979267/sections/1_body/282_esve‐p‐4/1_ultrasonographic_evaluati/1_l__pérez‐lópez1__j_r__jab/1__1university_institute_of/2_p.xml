<p>A total of 86 clinically healthy dogs were prospectively included. Adrenal thickness in a sagittal plane were measured in dogs using the following weight categories: 21 dogs ≥2.5‐5 kg, 22 dogs &gt;5‐10 kg, 22 dogs &gt;10‐20 kg, and 21 dogs &gt;20‐40 kg. Reference ranges (5‐95th percentile) for left adrenal gland maximum thickness were as follows: 3.4‐4.8 mm (dogs ≥2.5‐5 kg), 3.4‐5.6 mm (dogs &gt;5‐10 kg), 3.9‐6.2 mm (dogs &gt;10‐20 kg), and 5.2‐7.4 mm (dogs &gt;20‐40 kg); whereas for right adrenal gland maximum thickness were as follows: 3.2‐5.5 mm (dogs ≥2.5‐5 kg), 3.8‐6.0 mm (dogs &gt;5‐10 kg), 4.2‐7.7 mm (dogs &gt;10‐20 kg), and 5.4‐9.4 mm (dogs &gt;20‐40 kg).</p>
