<p>Ultrasonography is commonly used in the diagnostic workup of dogs with hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) to support its diagnosis, to rule out non‚Äêadrenal diseases and to help differentiate the type of HAC. Some studies have established reference ranges for ultrasonographic adrenal gland thickness based on weight categories. However, the use of those ranges in dogs with HAC, have not been evaluated. Therefore, four weight categories were used in order to avoid large variations of weight within each group. The aims of this study were to establish new reference ranges for adrenal gland thickness in healthy dogs, to evaluate the sensitivity of those ranges to detect adrenomegaly in dogs with HAC and to describe ultrasonographic adrenal findings in dogs with HAC.</p>
