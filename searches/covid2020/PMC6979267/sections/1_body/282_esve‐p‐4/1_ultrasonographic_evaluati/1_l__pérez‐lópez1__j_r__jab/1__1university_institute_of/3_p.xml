<p>In addition, other 85 dogs with HAC were retrospectively included. These dogs were classified into the same weight categories used for healthy dogs: 23 dogs ≥2.5‐5 kg; 37 dogs &gt;5‐10 kg; 17 dogs &gt;10‐20 kg, and 8 dogs &gt;20‐40 kg. The overall sensitivity for detection of unilateral or bilateral adrenomegaly on ultrasound examination was 97% (82/85 dogs). Dogs with HAC were ultrasonographically classified as: 41 (48%) dogs with symmetrical adrenomegaly (consistent with pituitary‐dependent HAC), 11 (13%) dogs with unilateral adrenomegaly and atrophy of the contralateral adrenal gland or unilateral or bilateral adrenomegaly with malignancy features on the ultrasound examination (consistent with adrenal‐dependent HAC), 30 (35%) dogs with equivocal adrenal asymmetry, and 3 (4%) dogs with normal adrenal gland thickness.</p>
