<p>Six healthy mixed breed dogs were included in this study. Experimental endotoxemia was induced by injecting healthy dogs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 2 ug/kg, IV, once). Vital signs were monitored and serial blood samples were collected for measurement of serum PCT for 72â€‰hours following LPS injection. Difference in mean serum PCT between serial time points was assessed using a mixed effects model.</p>
