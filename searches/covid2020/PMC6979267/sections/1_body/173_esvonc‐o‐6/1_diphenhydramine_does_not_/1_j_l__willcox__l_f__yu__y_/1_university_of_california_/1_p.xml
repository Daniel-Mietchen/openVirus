<p>Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutics for canine high‐grade lymphoma. Besides dose‐dependent chronic cardiotoxicity, DOX can trigger acute cardiac arrhythmias during drug infusion. Diphenhydramine premedication is commonly used, as histamine release is a proposed mechanism for DOX‐associated arrhythmogenesis. The study objectives were to evaluate the incidence and severity of DOX infusion‐related cardiac arrhythmias in dogs with high‐grade lymphoma, and the effect of diphenhydramine premedication on arrhythmia number and severity during and after DOX infusion.</p>
