<p>Dogs with cytologically/histopathologically confirmed high‐grade lymphoma were screened with an echocardiogram and concurrent electrocardiogram for this randomized prospective cross‐over study. Group‐A received no premedication for DOX#1 and was premedicated with diphenhydramine for DOX#2; Group‐B received diphenhydramine with DOX#1 and no premedication for DOX#2. For both visits, Holter monitor data was collected 1 hour before DOX and 3 hours post‐administration and analyzed by Burdick Holter Analysis Software. Commercially available software (Prism7.0) was used for normality testing and paired‐sample analysis with each individual acting as its own control.</p>
