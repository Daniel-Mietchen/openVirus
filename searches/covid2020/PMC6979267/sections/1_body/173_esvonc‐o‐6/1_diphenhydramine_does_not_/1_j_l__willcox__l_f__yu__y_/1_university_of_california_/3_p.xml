<p>Seventeen dogs were enrolled and 10 dogs [Group‐A(6), Group‐B(4)] completed the protocol. There was no statistical difference between groups A and B when evaluating total ventricular premature complex (VPC) numbers (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.34), change of VPCs/hour (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.25), total atrial premature complex (APC) numbers (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.5), change of APCs/hour (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.06), or arrhythmia severity score (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.99).
