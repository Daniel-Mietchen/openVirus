<p>Feline caliciviruses (FCV) are common feline pathogens causing “flu”‐like signs. Rarely, FCVs cause virulent systemic disease (FCV‐VSD) characterised by jaundice, facial/limb oedema, skin ulceration and death. The pathogenesis of FCV‐VSD is poorly understood. The aims of this study were to 1) characterise clinical and virological features of two nosocomial outbreaks of FCV‐VSD in Australia in 2015 and 2018, 2) assess efficacy of three antivirals against representative outbreak strains
