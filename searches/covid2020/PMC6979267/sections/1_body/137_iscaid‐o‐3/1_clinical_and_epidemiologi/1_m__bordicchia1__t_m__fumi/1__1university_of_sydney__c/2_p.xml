<p>Cats presenting with ≥1 sign consistent with FCV‐VSD during the outbreaks were included. Viral isolation and whole genome sequencing were performed on residual diagnostic oropharyngeal swabs and/or necropsy tissue. One virus from each outbreak was tested in plaque reduction assays against nitazoxanide (NTZ), 2’‐C‐methylcytidine (2CMC) and NITD‐008. For each antiviral, EC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined. Therapeutic index (TI) was derived from the EC
 <sub>50</sub> and half maximal cytotoxic concentration in CRFK cells.
