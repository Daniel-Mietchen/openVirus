<p>Twenty cases (NSW n = 8, QLD n = 12) were identified (age: 1‐72 months, median 16.7). Onset of signs was ≤10 days after hospital admission for surgery in 19/20 cases. FCV vaccination status, where known, was current in 15/16 cases. Overall mortality was 45%. Phylogenetic analysis of full FCV genomes revealed co‐infections of two FCV lineages in NSW and a separate lineage in QLD. Dose‐response inhibition of both FCV‐VSD strains was obtained with all antivirals; NTZ EC
