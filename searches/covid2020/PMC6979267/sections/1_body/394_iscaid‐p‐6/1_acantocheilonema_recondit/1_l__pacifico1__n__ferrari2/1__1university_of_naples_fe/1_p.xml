 <italic>Acantocheilonema reconditum</italic> is a parasite transmitted by fleas, lice and ticks and is included among the filaroid species infecting dogs. Contrary to the more well‚Äêstudied 
 <italic>Dirofilaria immitis</italic> and 
 <italic>Dirofilaria repens</italic>, 
 <italic>A. reconditum</italic> is believed to be less pathogenic, as adult worms are localized in the subcutaneous tissues and in the perirenal fat. Although previous studies reported the absence of clinical symptoms in infected dogs, there are few data regarding the haematological and biochemical changes that could be potentially caused by this parasite.
