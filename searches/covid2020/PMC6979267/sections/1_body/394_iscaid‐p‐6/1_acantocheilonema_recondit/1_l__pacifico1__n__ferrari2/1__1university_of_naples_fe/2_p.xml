<p>Because hunting dogs are frequently exposed to vector‐borne pathogens, the aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence, risk factors and potential hematobiochemical abnormalities associated with 
 <italic>A. reconditum</italic> infection in this specific canine population. Blood samples were collected from 3020 hunting dogs living in Campania region, and were tested by a modified Knott technique to count and identify microfilariae. Out of 3020 dogs tested, 84 were positive to 
 <italic>A. reconditum</italic>, with an overall prevalence of 2.78% (95% CI: 2.19% ‐ 3.37%). The number of microfilariae/ml ranged from 1 to 442. After excluding dogs co‐infected by different filarial worm species and/or other vector‐borne pathogens common in Southern Italy, n. 74 dogs showed 
 <italic>A. reconditum</italic> single infection. The main clinical features observed were dehydration (n. 1), fever (n. 1), congested mucous membranes (n. 2) and exercise intolerance (n. 2). Complete blood cell count results revealed leukocytosis (n. 16), anaemia (n. 2), thrombocytopenia (n. 8), eosinophilia (n. 1). Biochemical data showed increased serum values of total globulins (n. 14), albumins (n. 9), gamma glutamyl transferase (n. 2) and alkaline phosphate (n. 1), hypoalbuminemia was observed in one dog.
