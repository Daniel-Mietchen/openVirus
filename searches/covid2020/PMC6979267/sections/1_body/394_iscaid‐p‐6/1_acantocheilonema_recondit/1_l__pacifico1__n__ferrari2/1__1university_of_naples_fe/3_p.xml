<p>Dogs co‐infected with other vector‐borne pathogens were not included in the statistical analysis. The living area (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), type of hunted species (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0004) and ectoparasite infestation (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.018) were variables significantly associated to 
 <italic>A. reconditum</italic> infection. Living in Caserta province (OR = 6.0, 95% CI: 2.6‐14.2) and in Napoli province (OR = 7.0, 95% CI: 2.4‐20.2), hunting of wild mammals (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6‐5.1) and ectoparasite infestation (OR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1‐3.4) represented risk factors. Concerning the haematochemical parameters of infected dogs, a significant negative correlation between microfilaraemic load and serum albumin level was found (Pearson Correlation Coefficient: −0.35; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.025).
