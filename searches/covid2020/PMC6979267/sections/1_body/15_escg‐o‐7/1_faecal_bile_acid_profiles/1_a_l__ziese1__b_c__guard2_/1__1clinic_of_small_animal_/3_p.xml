<p>On day 0, concentration of lithocholic acid was significantly lower in AHDS‐D than in HC‐D (p &lt; 0.001). On day 2, total faecal BA were significantly increased in AHDS‐D (p &lt; 0.001) compared to HC‐D. More precisely, primary BA were significantly increased in AHDS‐D on day 2 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.034) with significantly higher concentration of cholic acid (p = 0.004), while secondary BA were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.001) with significantly lower concentrations of deoxycholic acid (p &lt; 0.001) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (p &lt; 0.001). Dogs in AHDS‐D showed a significant decrease in total primary BA concentrations (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.021) with significantly lower concentrations of cholic acid (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.027) and deoxycholic acid (p = 0.021) on day 14 compared to day 2.
