<p>Only dogs with “typical” PH (hyponatremia and/or hyperkalemia) at the time of diagnosis were included. Healthy dogs (HD) were used as controls. Serum and urine chemistry were performed on combined samples using an automated analyser, and FEe was calculated. Nonparametric tests were used to compare FEe among groups. Data are expressed as median and (range).
