<p>Seven dogs with AAI, 18 TD and 115 HD were enrolled; 76 follow‐up from TD (13 DOCP, 5 fludrocortisone) dogs were evaluated. 
 <list list-type="order" id="jvim15658-list0001">
  <list-item>
   <p>FE of sodium (FENa), cloride (FECl) and calcium (FECa) were elevated in AAI [FENa% 2.64(1.48‐7.77); FECl% 3.76(1.87‐8.15); FECa% 1.68(0.68‐8.11)]; they were significantly lower in TD [FENa% 0.41(0.04‐1.91); FECl% 0.73(0.07‐21.85); FECa% 0.35(0.07‐1.82)], but still significantly higher compared to HD [FENa% 0.25(0.01‐1.55); FECl% 0.54(0.05‐2.28); FECa% 0.14(0.03‐0.66)]. AAI and TD had a significantly higher FE of K (FEK%) [18.53(8.34‐62.74); 16.01(4.33‐44.19)] compared to HD [10.54(2.23‐45.20)].</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>FENa and FEK were not significantly different among the 3 groups; nevertheless, despite not significant, over‐controlled dogs had lower FENa and higher FEK if compared to controlled dogs [FENa% 0.43(0.04‐0.95) vs 0.40(0.04‐1.91); FEK% 16.14(4.33‐42.95) vs 17.10(5.76‐44.19)]. FECa was significantly lower in under‐controlled compared to well controlled and over‐controlled dogs [FECa% 0.11(0.07‐0.14); 0.33(0.07‐1.60); 0.55(0.17‐1.82)].</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>FENa, FECl and FEK did not differ significantly among 3 groups; nonetheless, despite not significant, all showed an increasing trend over time. Although not significant, FECa was lower at 23‐27 days after DOCP.</p>
