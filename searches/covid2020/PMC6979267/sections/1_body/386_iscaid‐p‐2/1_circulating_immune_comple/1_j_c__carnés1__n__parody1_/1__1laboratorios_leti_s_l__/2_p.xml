<p>A total of 44 dogs, classified according to the LeishVet criteria (Healthy (n = 13), Infected Asymptomatic (n = 12) and Infected Symptomatic ‐stage I (n = 9), II (n = 17), III (n = 8) and IV (n = 1)), were included in the study. CICs were isolated from serum samples using a slightly modified PEG‐precipitation method, and their levels measured by ELISA. The protein content was estimated by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay. A Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) of CICs was done in order to investigate the relationship between CIC molecular size distribution and the progression of the disease.</p>
