<p>Dogs are the main domestic reservoir of 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic>. In 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> infected dogs unable to control the infection, a large and uncontrolled humoral immune response is elicited, which is inefficient against parasites. The high concentration of antibodies and circulating antigens in canine leishmaniosis can result in the formation of Circulating Immune Complexes (CICs). Their deposition in tissues has been associated with tissue damage and especially glomerulonephritis and renal failure. However, little is known about the relationship between the presence of CICs and the progression of the disease. The objective was to evaluate the levels of CICs and their correlation with the severity of the disease in serum samples from healthy and infected animals.
