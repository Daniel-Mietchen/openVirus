<p>Results showed a statistical significant correlation between CICs levels and the stage of the pathology in infected dogs. As expected, healthy and infected asymptomatic animals did not show CICs related with the infection and there was a direct relationship of levels of CICs, total protein concentration and progression of the disease. It was also confirmed the correlation between IFAT titers and CICs levels. In addition, data showed that dogs with more severe clinical signs presented large size protein aggregates whereas higher concentration of smaller size aggregates were observed in non infected and asymptomatic dogs. This fact demonstrates a clear positive correlation between clinical stage and the size of precipitated‚ÄêCICs.</p>
