<p>Intensive medical care of companion animals and their close contact to people pose a risk for the selection and zoonotic transmission of multidrug‚Äêresistant organisms (MDROs). Infection prevention and control (IPC) concepts are key measures to reduce the spread of MDROs, but data on IPC standards in small animal clinics and practices is sparse. The goals of the study were to assess IPC standards, environmental MDRO contamination and prevalence of MDRO carriage in veterinary personnel in small animal clinics/practices in Switzerland.</p>
