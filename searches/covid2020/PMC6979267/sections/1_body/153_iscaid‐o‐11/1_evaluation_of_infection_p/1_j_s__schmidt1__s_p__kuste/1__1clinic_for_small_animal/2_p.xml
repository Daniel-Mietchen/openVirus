<p>Three large clinics (A‐C), two medium‐sized clinics (D‐E) and two primary opinion practices (F‐G) were included. Structured one‐day IPC audits were performed and environmental samples collected from high‐touch surfaces. Nasal and faecal MDRO carriage in veterinary staff (institutions A‐C, G) was assessed by providing kits for sampling. The samples were analysed for methicillin‐resistant (MR) 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), MR 
 <italic>S. pseudintermedius</italic> (MRSP), MR coagulase‐negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), MR 
 <italic>Macrococcus</italic> spp., colistin‐resistant 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, and extended‐spectrum beta‐lactamase (ESBL)‐ and carbapenemase‐producing 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (CPE) using enrichment and selective procedures. Species identification was performed by MALDI‐TOF MS analysis. Antibiotic resistance genes were identified by PCR and sequencing. Genetic relatedness was assessed by rep‐PCR (for 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>) and multilocus sequence typing (for MRSP).
