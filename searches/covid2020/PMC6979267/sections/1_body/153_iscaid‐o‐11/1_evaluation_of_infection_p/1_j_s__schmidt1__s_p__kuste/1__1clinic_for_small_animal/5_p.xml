<p>This study documents major deficits in IPC standards in small animal clinics in Switzerland and extensive, but variable, environmental contamination with MDRO. We report for the first time the detection of CPE in environmental samples in a small animal clinic and the faecal carriage of a related CPE isolate in a staff member. The present study highlights the potential of small animal clinics to spread MDRO and the need to promote IPC concepts in these institutions.</p>
