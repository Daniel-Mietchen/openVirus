<p>To each dog a CSA grade score was given according to Sharp (1989) at the time of diagnosis; a rhinoscopic scoring according to Zonderland (2002) was given after endoscopic examination. The score was modified by the authors by creating three categories of severity: mild CSA (score between 0 and 5), moderate CSA (score between 6 and 10) and severe CSA (score between 11 and 16). The amount of fungal plaques was considered mild when countable, moderate when partially occupying the sinonasal cavity and abundant when obliterating the sinonasal cavity. A clinical scoring proposed by Schuller (2007) was modified and used to assess the patients prior to endoscopic follow‚Äêup: dogs were classified as having no (no clinical signs reported), mild (occasional sneezing, occasional reverse sneeze, serous to mucoid discharge), moderate (mucopurulent discharge, frequent sneezing, frequent reverse sneezing) or severe (severe mucopurulent discharge, stertor, persistent reverse sneezing, persistent sneezing, epistaxis, generalized malaise) clinical signs.</p>
