<p>The electronic records of a tertiary referral centre were searched for cats receiving prednisolone at a dose of &gt;1.9 mg/kg/day of &gt;3 weeks duration, and that had follow‐up data available of &gt;6 weeks during a study period between January 2010 and June 2017. In total 143 cats were included in the study. Of these cats, 14 cats (9.8%) were diagnosed with GIH or GIDM. Nine cats (6.3%) developed GIDM, with 8 requiring insulin therapy and 1 was euthanized due to diabetic ketoacidosis. The remaining 5 cats (3.4%) were identified as GIH with none requiring insulin treatment. Twelve out of 14 cats (85.7%) developed GIH or GIDM within 3 months after the initiation of prednisolone therapy, the remaining two cats developed GIDM after 27 and 32 months. Four of the cats developing GIDM/GIH were &lt; 2 years of age. Comparison between cats developing GIH or GIDM to those that did not, showed no statistical difference in the baseline (pre‐prednisolone) blood glucose, presence of glucosuria, body weight and body condition score. A trend towards cats developing GIDM/GIH if receiving &gt;3.0 mg/kg starting dose (OR 2.7) was seen, however this was not statistically significant (P 0.097).</p>
