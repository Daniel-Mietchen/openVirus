<p>Ultrasonography is a sensitive method to measure adrenal gland size. The most reliable indicator of adrenal gland size is the maximum diameter of the caudal pole (thickness). However pituitary hyperadrenocorticism has an increased prevalence in small‐breed dogs, there are only few informations in the scientific literature about the correlation between the bodyweight, age and size of adrenal glands in dogs (general upper limit is 7,4 mm). Recently one retrospective study suggested 6 mm cut‐off value for dogs below 10 kg and another found an age dependency of the size.</p>
