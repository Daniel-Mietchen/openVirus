<p>There was a significant correlation between adrenal gland size and bodyweight in the entire range of 3‐42 kg and no significant correlation in the subgroup of dogs below 10 kg. There was no age dependency. We found significant difference between adrenal gland sizes of dogs below 10 kg and those of weighting more. Adrenal gland sizes were normally distributed. In the group of dogs weighting less than 10 kg the thickness of the left adrenal gland's caudal pole was 4,5+/−0,7 mm, while the right adrenal gland's size was 4,7+/−0,8 mm. Normal range for the left adrenal gland's size was 3,0‐6,0 mm and 3,1‐6,1 mm for the right one (95% CI). Comparing data of healthy dogs and dogs with pituitary hyperadrenocorticism resulted 5,5 mm to be the optimal upper cut‐off value for dogs below 10 kg. This value provided 82% sensitivity and 94% specificity for the left adrenal gland and 76% sensitivity and 88% specificity for the right one to diagnose pituitary hyperadrenocorticism using ultrasonography.</p>
