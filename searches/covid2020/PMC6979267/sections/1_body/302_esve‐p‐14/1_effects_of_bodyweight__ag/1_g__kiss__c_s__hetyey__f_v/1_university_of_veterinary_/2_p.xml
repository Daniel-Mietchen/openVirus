<p>We aimed to examine adrenal gland's thickness of dogs in a retrospective study. Results of 67 dogs (healthy and diagnosed with pituitary hyperadrenocorticism) were used. Diagnosis of pituitary hyperadrenocorticism was based on clinical symptoms and dexamethason supression test. Bodyweight ranged from 3,0 to 42,0 kg (12,7+/−9,6), while age ranged from 1,2 to 14,4 years (7,9+/−3,6). The correlation of bodyweight, age and adrenal gland thickness were analysed in healthy dogs (n = 31). The subgroup below 10 kg (n = 17) was compared to dogs diagnosed with pituitary hyperadrenocorticism below 10 kg (n = 17). To data analysis descriptive statistics, correlation‐ and regression‐analysis, hypothesis‐tests and ROC‐analysis were used (
