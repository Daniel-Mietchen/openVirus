<p>Canine diabetes mellitus (DM) is more prevalent in certain breeds, suggesting an underlying genetic basis, although environmental factors may also be involved. Notably, dog breeds with low DM risk are over‐represented in studies of neoplastic transformation of pancreatic beta‐cells (insulinoma). This suggests that beta‐cell survival may be an important contributing factor in canine DM, and that similar genes may be involved in canine DM and insulinoma. Previous genetics work in canine diabetes mellitus (DM) has focused on candidate genes and genome‐wide association studies, employing a case‐control design within individual breeds. However, this design does not account for the fact that, within high risk breeds, a fixed genetic risk of DM may exist, resulting in only minimal genetic differences between cases and controls.</p>
