<p>The aim of this study was to develop a new model for identification of genetic risk variants in complex disease, in order to identify new canine DM genes. This was achieved by exploring the genetic differences between dog breeds at very high risk of DM (Samoyed ‐ Odds Ratio 15.2) and exceptionally low risk of DM (Boxer ‐ Odds Ratio &lt; 0.01), as part of the Canine Diabetes Genetics Partnership initiative.</p>
