<p>Whole genome sequencing (WGS) at 30X coverage was undertaken on 6 diabetic Samoyeds and 6 Boxers with insulinoma, using Illumina HiSeqX technology. Six Samoyeds and 6 Boxers without DM or insulinoma underwent WGS as controls. DNA was extracted from blood samples that were surplus to requirements for clinical purposes. A custom bioinformatics pipeline was developed to annotate and prioritise variants for follow‐up, based on the Genome Analysis ToolKit. Variants were annotated according to their minor allele frequency (by breed or case‐control status), predicted impact on gene function and location near a region with a plausible role in beta‐cell function or diabetes risk. In Samoyeds, &gt;4000 breed‐unique high or moderate impact variants were identified, &gt;3000 of which were present in more than one Samoyed, and 173 of which were found exclusively in the diabetic group. In Boxers, &gt;1500 breed‐unique high or moderate impact variants were identified, &gt;150 of which were present in more than one Boxer, and 68 of which were found exclusively in the insulinoma group. Replication and functional studies are in progress to validate candidates and investigate underlying mechanisms. This study demonstrates that WGS offers a promising route for investigation of complex diseases where genetic risk may be fixed at a high or low level within breeds.</p>
