<p>Low serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D
 <sub>3</sub>) has been associated with cardiovascular (CV) disease in people and dogs. We aimed to determine if 25(OH)D
 <sub>3</sub> and its metabolite, 3‐epi‐25(OH)D
 <sub>3</sub> (3‐epi), are lower in cats with cardiomyopathy (CM) vs. normal cats, or if associations with certain clinical variables exist. CM cats (n = 44) were enrolled from patients at the Veterinary Medical Centers of Iowa State (ISU) and Tufts Universities; 38 CM cats had congestive heart failure. Exclusion criteria included hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and clinically relevant systemic (including kidney) disease. Normal cats (N) were recruited at ISU; 44 were age‐ and sex‐matched to CM cats, although 56 normal cats ultimately were enrolled. All cats were eating commercial cat foods. CV exam, blood pressure and echocardiographic data were collected; collected serum was frozen until analyzed.
