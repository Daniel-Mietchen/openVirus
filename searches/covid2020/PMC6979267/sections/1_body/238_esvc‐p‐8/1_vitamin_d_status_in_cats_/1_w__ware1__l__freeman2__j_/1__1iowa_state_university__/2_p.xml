<p>25(OH)D
 <sub>3</sub> and 3‐epi were positively correlated (correlation coefficient, 0.35; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004). However, neither was significantly different between CM and matched‐N groups (paired Wilcoxson rank‐sum). Linear regression analysis to assess impact of CM status, age, and sex among all enrolled cats showed age was significant to 25(OH)D
 <sub>3</sub> (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0028). Statistical modeling including all variables was confounded by multicollinearity; therefore, one‐by‐one simple linear regression tested for relationships between vitamin D status and 18 clinical variables. Significant relationships were found between 25(OH)D
 <sub>3</sub> and age, survival time, azotemia category, left atrial enlargement, and left ventricular fractional shortening (FS). After accounting for age, only FS and survival time remained significant with 25(OH)D
 <sub>3</sub>. We conclude that vitamin D status in cats is not significantly associated with CM.
