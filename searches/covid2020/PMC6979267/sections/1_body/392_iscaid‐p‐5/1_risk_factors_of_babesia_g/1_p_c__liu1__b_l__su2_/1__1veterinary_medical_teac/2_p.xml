<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for 
 <italic>B.gibsoni</italic> was performed firstly to divide the dogs into positive (59 dogs) and negative (53 dogs) groups. Factors including environment, season, breed, gender, intact or neuter status, living lifestyle, external parasites prevention, urine color, mucous membrane color and history of babesiosis were analyzed by using of chi‐square test initially. Variables with P‐value ≤0.1 were further analyzed with a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis. Differences were considered to be statistically significant when their associated P‐values were ≤ 0.05. The odds ratio of irregularly external parasites prevention (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, OR = 4.623, CI:1.935‐11.044) and presenting of dark brown urine (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005, OR = 3.336, CI:1.432‐7.774) were 4.623 and 3.336, respectively. Therefore, the both factors were most likely to be associated with infection.
