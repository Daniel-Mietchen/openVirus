<p>Using this cut‐off value, tubular proteinuria was diagnosed in 10 dogs (35.71%) and non‐tubular proteinuria in 17 animals (60.71%). The uAPR results showed a high correlation with the electrophoresis outcomes. There was only one dog with a false negative result (‘tubular’ on uAPR and ‘non‐tubular’ on electrophoresis), and 3 dogs had false positive results (‘non‐tubular’ on uAPR and normal protein excretion pattern on electrophoresis).</p>
