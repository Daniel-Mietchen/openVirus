<p>The median (lower and upper quartile) of the UPC was 1.27 (0.48; 3.53), the UAC was 0.51 (0.10; 2.69), and the uAPR was 0.56 (0.15; 0.77) in the urine specimens. With receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis the ideal cut‚Äêoff value was determined to be 0.37, below which the tubular proteinuria could be identified with high confidence (sensitivity = 93.75%, specificity = 75.0%, positive predictive value = 82.35%, negative predictive value = 81.81%).</p>
