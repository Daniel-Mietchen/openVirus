<p>27 proteinuric canine left‐over urine samples were used in this study. 11 samples belonged to laboratory beagles and 17 to clinical patients. In addition to urinary protein and creatinine concentration determination, albumin was measured by immunoturbidimetric method. The urinary albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio (UAC), urinary protein‐to‐creatinine ratio (UPC), and the ratio of UAC and UPC (uAPR) were calculated. The findings were compared to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE). Solely tubular proteinuria was considered ‘tubular’, while mixed (tubular and glomerular) and glomerular proteinuria were considered as ‘non‐tubular’.</p>
