<p>HMs with &gt;20 hours of valid data obtained from dogs with sinus rhythm (SR) or different types of tachyarrhythmias were used. One operator blinded to the underlying rhythm diagnosis reviewed the automated analyses in order to: assess HMs quality, manually correct any software misinterpretation, and make the rhythm diagnosis. Cardiac rhythms were classified as SR; SR with frequent (&gt;100) premature ectopic complexes (SR + PEC), either supraventricular or ventricular; atrial fibrillation (AF); and AF with frequent ventricular premature complexes (AF + VPC). For each HM, a LP was generated by the software using all RR intervals. LPs were studied qualitatively and quantitatively and distinct LPPs were created by adapting previously recognized patterns in humans. The diagnostic accuracy of LP analysis in predicting the underlying cardiac rhythm was evaluated by calculating the corresponding sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp).</p>
