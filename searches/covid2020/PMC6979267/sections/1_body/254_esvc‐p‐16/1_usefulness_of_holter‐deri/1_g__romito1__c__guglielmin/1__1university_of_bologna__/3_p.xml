<p>One hundred and nineteen HMs were analyzed including 48 SR, 49 SR + PEC, 4 AF, and 18 AF + VPC. Ten distinct LPPs were identified: comet (10 cases); torpedo (3 cases); Y‐shaped (6 cases); diamond (12 cases); diamond with central silent zone (15 cases); a combination of one of the above 5 patterns with a double side‐lobe (DSL) (46 cases), a triple side‐lobe (2 cases), or a quadruple side‐lobe (3 cases); fan (19 cases); and fan with DSL (3 cases). When pooled together as a single normal pattern, the comet, torpedo, Y‐shaped, and diamonds, predicted presence of SR with Se and Sp of 91.7% and 97.2%, respectively. Two LPs with a diamond pattern had a Holter diagnosis of SR + PEC. The DSL pattern indicated presence of SR + PEC with Se and Sp of 85.7% and 94.3%, respectively. Triple and quadruple side lobe patterns were exclusively associated to SR + VPC. The fan configuration (considering together the fan and fan with DSL pattern) indicated AF with both Se and Sp of 100%. The three cases of fan with DSL were associated with AF + VPC.</p>
