<p>Lorenz plot (LP) is a representation of heart rate variability that summarizes graphically the beat‐to‐beat intervals recorded during a Holter monitoring (HM). The use of LP patterns (LPPs) to diagnose rhythm disturbances has been studied in people, but little is known in animals. The aim of this study was to analyze the graphic features of LPs and to evaluate the diagnostic value of LPPs for identifying arrhythmias in dogs.</p>
