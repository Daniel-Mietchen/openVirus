<p>Our findings suggest that neutrophils play a role in the systemic inflammatory response associated with CIE in dogs. NLR (ie., leukogram changes) in canine CIE are of similar magnitude as in human IBD. NLR can be easily obtained during routine hematology, and can potentially aid in the subclassification of dogs with CIE. The potential utility of NLR in the monitoring of dogs with CIE requires further investigation.</p>
