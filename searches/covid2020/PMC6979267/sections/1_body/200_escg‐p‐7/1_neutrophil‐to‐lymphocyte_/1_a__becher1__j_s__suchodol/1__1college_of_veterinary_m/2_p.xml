<p>Data from 91 dogs diagnosed with CIE (that had not received steroids for ≥2 weeks prior to diagnostic evaluation) at 2 veterinary centers were used for this study. NLR was calculated as [neutrophil count/lymphocyte count] and was evaluated for a potential relationship with the severity of clinical signs (CCECAI scoring system, n = 65), serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations (n = 65), histologic lesion severity (4‐point semi‐quantitative grading system, n = 36), serum and fecal concentrations of other inflammatory markers (n = 60), and the response to treatment (FRE vs. IRE, n = 39). Statistical significance was set at
