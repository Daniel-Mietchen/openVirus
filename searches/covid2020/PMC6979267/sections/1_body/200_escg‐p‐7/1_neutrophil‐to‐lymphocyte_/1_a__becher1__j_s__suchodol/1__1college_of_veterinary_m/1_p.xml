<p>Chronic inflammatory enteropathies (CIE) comprise an important group of diseases in dogs. Only few biomarkers that can be routinely measured (eg, serum cobalamin and albumin, fecal calprotectin) appear to be of clinical utility in dogs with CIE and can potentially aid in CIE subclassification based on the response to treatment (ie, diagnosis of food‐responsive enteropathy [FRE] vs. steroid−/immunosuppressant‐responsive enteropathy [IRE]). The neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was recently shown to have diagnostic and prognostic potential in humans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). NLR also appears to be useful in the diagnosis of dogs with hypoadrenocorticism, but the NLR has not been evaluated or reported in dogs with CIE.</p>
