<p>NLR ranged from 0.23‐54.0 (median: 5.69) in all dogs with CIE. NLR was significantly higher in dogs with very severe clinical signs compared to dogs with mild (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.014) or moderate (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.026) clinical disease. NLR was not correlated with the overall histologic score (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), but was significantly higher in dogs with histologic lesions compatible with protein‐losing enteropathy (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006). Hypoalbuminemia (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), but not hypocobalaminemia, was significantly associated with a higher NLR. NLR correlated significantly with serum S100A12 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.032), C‐reactive protein (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.046), decoy receptor for advanced glycation end products (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.034), and fecal alpha
 <sub>1</sub>‐proteinase inhibitor (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), but not with serum or fecal calprotectin concentrations. Dogs with IRE (n = 26) had significantly higher NLRs (median: 8.41) than dogs with FRE (median: 3.09; n = 13; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.008), and an NLR ≥4.60 best distinguished dogs with IRE from those with FRE (sensitivity: 77%, specificity: 69%).
