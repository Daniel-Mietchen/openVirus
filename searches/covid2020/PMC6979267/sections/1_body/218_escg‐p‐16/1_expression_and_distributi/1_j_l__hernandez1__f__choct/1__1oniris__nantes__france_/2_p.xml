<p>Ten dogs with IBD were included in this study. Diagnosis was based on clinical signs of at least 3 weeks' duration, the presence of a lymphocytic and plasmacytic and/or eosinophilic inflammation on colon biopsies and exclusion of other causes of chronic gastrointestinal signs. Nine dogs were included in the control group. Colon paraffin‐embedded biopsies were processed for immunohistochemistry using anti‐human TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 antibodies. The expression of TLRs in the different samples was graded from 0 (no expression) to 3 (strong expression) by a board‐certified pathologist in a blinded fashion.</p>
