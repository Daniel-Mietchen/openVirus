<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common cause of chronic gastrointestinal disease in dogs. The current paradigm of IBD involves complex interactions between environmental factors, such as the intestinal microbiota, and dysregulated host responses. Toll‐Like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 recognize bacterial Pathogen‐Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). In a previous study, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 mRNAs were reported to be up‐regulated in the inflamed duodenal and colonic mucosa of IBD dogs compared to asymptomatic healthy Beagles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of these receptors by immunohistochemistry in colon biopsies isolated from dogs with IBD compared to asymptomatic controls.</p>
