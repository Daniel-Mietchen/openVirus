<p>To our knowledge, our study describes for the first time the pattern of expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 in the colon of dogs and suggests that their expression is poorly affected by IBD. Further experiments are warranted in a larger number of patients and in other intestinal segments (duodenum and ileum) to analyze whether epithelial TLR9 expression might be correlated with clinical activity or histopathology score.</p>
