<p>TLR5 and TLR9 were detected both in the epithelial cells and in the lamina propria cells. In contrast, TLR2 was detected only in the epithelial cells while TLR4 staining was restricted to the leucocytes of the lamina propria. No statistical differences were found in TLRs expression when comparing IBD dogs with asymptomatic dogs although epithelial TLR9 expression tended to be higher in the IBD group (
