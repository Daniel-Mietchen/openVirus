<p>In the present study the therapeutic efficacy of the human antiretroviral compound used in acquired immune deficiency syndrome, was investigated in the treatment of cats naturally infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FiV). Cats presenting symptoms of recurrent infections (sinusitis, stomatitis) were tested for their FIV and FeLV status by IDEXX SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo test. Cats were included in this study if they tested positive for FiV and presented chronic oral or nasal inflammation. Nine cats met the mentioned inclusion criteria. Tenofovir (Virofob, Alvogen) was administered orally, once daily at a dose of 50 mg/cat for 30 days, alongside specific treatment. For the experimental group, day 0 and day 30 measures included complete blood count, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, BUN and creatinine. One of the nine cats did not tolerate Tenofovir administration and was excluded from the study after five days, due to severe hypersalivation.</p>
