<p>Feline immunodeficiency virus (FiV) is one the most common infectious agents of cats. FIV is a lentivirus that shares many properties with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can cause an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) due to gradual loss in T helper cell numbers and function, characterized by increased susceptibility to secondary pathogens. Both viruses preferentially infect CD4+ T lymphocytes, leading to an inversion of the CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio. Tenofovir, a Nucleotide Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor, is effective against FIV in vitro, and there is some evidence that tenovovir might have greater anti‚ÄêFIV efficacy with less cytotoxicity than other antiretroviral compounds.</p>
