<p>We evaluated the mucosal concentrations of calprotectin in dogs with CIE in comparison with healthy Beagle dogs using a particle‚Äêenhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA) method on a clinical chemistry analyzer. Additionally, we assessed the association of mucosal calprotectin levels with the canine clinical IBD activity index (CIBDAI), histopathologic findings, clinical outcome, and serum albumin concentrations. Intestinal mucosal biopsies were collected from 38 dogs with CIE (duodenum [n = 34], ileum [n = 10], colon [n = 14], and caecum [n = 7]). Archived intestinal tissue samples from 18 healthy Beagle dogs served as controls (duodenum [n = 17], ileum [n = 18], colon [n = 18], and caecum [n = 6]). Data are presented as medians (interquartile ranges).</p>
