<p>Calprotectin, a Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> âˆ’ binding protein of the S100/calgranulin family, has potential as a marker of inflammation in dogs and mainly originating from granulocytes. Increased canine calprotectin concentrations have been detected in feces and serum samples from dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CIE). However, intestinal mucosal calprotectin concentrations have not been extensively investigated in canine CIE.
