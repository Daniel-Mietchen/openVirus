<p>This study showed that mucosal calprotectin concentrations are increased in the duodenum and colon of dogs with CIE. The results provide supporting evidence for the potential diagnostic value of mucosal (or fecal) calprotectin concentrations in dogs with CIE. Further prospective research is needed to assess the value of measuring mucosal calprotectin concentrations in clinical practice, the relationship between mucosal and fecal calprotectin, and other inflammatory markers in dogs with CIE.</p>
