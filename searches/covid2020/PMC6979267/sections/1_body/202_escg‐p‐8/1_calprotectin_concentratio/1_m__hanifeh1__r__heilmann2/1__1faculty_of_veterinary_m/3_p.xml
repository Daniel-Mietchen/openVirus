<p>In comparison to healthy Beagles, mucosal calprotectin concentrations of CIE‐dogs were higher in the duodenum (332 [91‐639] vs. 94 [24‐137] μg/L; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and colon (380 [187‐542] vs. 112 [36‐196] μg/L; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Histologic severity was significantly associated with mucosal calprotectin levels (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) for total histopathology score, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the duodenum, and epithelial injury in the colon. Duodenal calprotectin concentrations were higher in hypoalbuminemic dogs than normoalbuminemic dogs (1441 [1098‐1748] μg/L vs. 227 [74‐506] μg/L), but because of the small number of hypoalbuminemic dogs (n = 4) the results were only descriptively reported. There was no significant association of mucosal calprotectin levels with CIBDAI scores or with the clinical outcome.
