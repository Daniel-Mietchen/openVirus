<p id="Par41">The CDC-validated ZIKV-specific TaqMan® RT-qPCR assays targeting prM and E genes along with the PAHO ZIKV-specific TaqMan® RT-qPCR assay targeting NS2B gene were utilized as previously described. Primer and probe sequences as well as fluorescent dyes and quenchers used are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The reaction was set up using the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, the 25 μl reaction contained 12.5 μl of 2X QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Master Mix with ROX, 0.25 μl QuantiTect RT Mix, 200 nM TaqMan® fluorogenic probe, 500 nM each primer, and 5 μl of template RNA. Reverse transcription and amplification were carried out in an ABI 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems®, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The program included 30 min at 50 °C (reverse transcription step), 15 min at 95 °C (PCR initial activation step), followed by 45 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s (denaturation) and 60 °C for 1 min (combined annealing/extension). Even though the analytical sensitivity and specificity of all ZIKV-specific RT-qPCR assays (targeting prM, E, and NS2B) were evaluated, only the ZIKV RT-qPCR assays targeting E and NS2B were used to assess their performance in ZIKV-spiked specimens and to compare with the performance of the ZIKV RT-iiPCR reagent set. Amplification with one of the two ZIKV RT-qPCR assays (E and NS2B) determined a sample as positive, with a cutoff Ct value of ≤38.5 as described by Lanciotti, et al. [
