<p id="Par35">Whole blood and serum specimens from each donor were separated into six aliquots and spiked with ZIKV PRVABC59 strain (1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU/ml of TCF) to yield different viral titers (10
 <sup>6</sup>, 10
 <sup>3</sup>, 10
 <sup>2</sup>, 10, and 1 PFU/ml) of whole blood or serum. One aliquot of both whole blood and serum from each donor was inoculated with an equivalent volume of uninfected EMEM as mock-spiked control. Overall, a total of 20 specimens for each viral concentration were generated (20 donors x [five different viral concentrations plus one mock-spiked control] = 120 whole blood/serum specimens). An aliquot from each spiked whole blood specimen (
 <italic>n</italic> = 120) was stored at −80 °C until nucleic acid extraction, while the remaining was centrifuged at 1000 X g for 10 min at 4 °C for plasma separation (
 <italic>n</italic> = 120) and stored at −80 °C until nucleic acid extraction. Spiked serum samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 120) were stored at −80 °C until nucleic acid extraction. Similarly, a total of 20 archived urine samples (stored at −80 °C) were obtained from volunteer donors (males/females). Urine samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 120) were separated and spiked with different concentrations of ZIKV PRVABC59 strain as described above and stored at −80 °C until nucleic acid extraction.
