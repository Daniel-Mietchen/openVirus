<p id="Par42">The ZIKV-specific RT-iiPCR (POCKIT™ Zika Virus Reagent Set) assay was designed to target the E gene of ZIKV (proprietary). The RT-iiPCR reaction conditions, such as concentrations of primers and probe, 
 <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase, and reverse transcriptase, were tested systematically to obtain the highest sensitivity and specificity. Following optimization of the RT-iiPCR assay conditions, the reagents including primers and probe were lyophilized (proprietary) and used in this study. Briefly, after reconstituting the lyophilized pellet with 50 μl of Premix Buffer B (GeneReach USA), 5 μl of the sample nucleic acid was added to the reaction. Subsequently, 50 μl of the final mixture was transferred into an R-tube™ (GeneReach USA), sealed with a cap, spun for 10 s in a cubee™ centrifuge (GeneReach USA), and placed into a POCKIT™ device (GeneReach USA). The default program, that included an RT step at 50 °C for 10 min and an iiPCR step at 95 °C for 30 min, completed in less than one hour. Signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, i.e. light signals collected after iiPCR/fluorescent signals collected before iiPCR [

The results were shown on the display screen at the end of the program. A “?” indicated that the results were ambiguous and the sample should be tested again (Fig.
