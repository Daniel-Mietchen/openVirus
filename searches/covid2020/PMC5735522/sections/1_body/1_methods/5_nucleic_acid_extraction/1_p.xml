<p id="Par38">Nucleic acids from TCF, spiked human specimens (whole blood, plasma, serum, semen, and urine), and spiked mosquito pools were extracted using an automated magnetic bead-based extraction system (taco™ mini, GeneReach USA) as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Briefly, 200 μl of TCF, spiked whole blood, plasma, serum, urine, or supernatant derived from mosquito pools were added into the first well of a taco™ Preloaded DNA/RNA Extraction plate (GeneReach USA) containing lysis buffer and subjected to the extraction steps as described in the manufacturer’s user manual. Elution was performed with 200 μl of Elution buffer. Due to sample limitations, 100 μl of spiked semen samples were used and nucleic acids were eluted with 100 μl of Elution buffer. All nucleic acids were stored at −80 °C for future use.
