<p id="Par31">Vero cells (ATCC® CCL-81™) were maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM, Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco®, Carlsbad, CA), and penicillin and streptomycin (100 U/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively; Gibco®) at 37 °C in 5% CO

 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> [ATCC® CRL-1660™]) and AP-61 (
 <italic>A. pseudoscutellaris</italic>) were kindly provided by Dr. Jason Velez (CDC, Atlanta, GA). C6/36 were maintained in 1X Dulbecco’s modified minimum essential medium (DMEM, Gibco®) supplemented with 7.5% sodium bicarbonate (Gibco®), 10% fetal bovine serum, 1X non-essential amino acids (Gibco®), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco®) at 30 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. AP-61 were maintained in 1X Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (Gibco®) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 7.5% tryptone phosphate broth (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 30 °C in 5% CO
