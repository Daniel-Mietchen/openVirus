<p id="Par32">Tissue culture fluid (TCF) derived from Vero cells infected with ZIKV PRVABC59 (ATCC® VR-1843™), FLR (ATCC® VR-1844™), and MR766 (ATCC® VR-1838™) strains were used for analytical sensitivity and specificity evaluation of ZIKV-specific RT-qPCR and RT-iiPCR assays. Briefly, confluent monolayers of Vero cells were inoculated with a 1/10 dilution of ZIKV PRVABC59, FLR, and MR 766 strains in a minimal volume of maintenance media without fetal bovine serum. After 1 h adsorption at 37 °C, monolayers were overlaid with complete EMEM and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> until 100% cytopathic effect was observed (72 h post infection). Infected flasks were frozen/thawed, clarified by centrifugation at 1500 
 <italic>X</italic> g for 15 min at 4 °C, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Mosquito cell lines, C6/36 and AP-61, were infected in a similar fashion. Viral stocks were subsequently titrated in confluent 6-well plates of Vero cells. Briefly, serial ten-fold dilutions (10
 <sup>−1</sup> – 10
 <sup>−12</sup>) of virus stocks were prepared in 1X MEM (Mediatech, Inc.) and 200 μl of each dilution were added in duplicate wells. After 1 h adsorption at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, infected monolayers were overlaid with complete EMEM supplemented with 0.75% carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and incubated for 96 h. Monolayers were stained with a 1% crystal violet solution, and viral titers expressed as plaque forming units per ml (PFU/ml) of TCF.
