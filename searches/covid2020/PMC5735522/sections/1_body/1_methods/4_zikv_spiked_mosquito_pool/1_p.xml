 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes were divided into 7 pools (15 mosquitoes per pool). One ml of mosquito diluent (1X DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin sulphate [Mediatech, Inc.], 100 U/ml and 100 μg/ml of penicillin and streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Gibco®) containing various concentrations of ZIKV PRVABC59 strain (10

Subsequently, mosquito pools were completely homogenized using an Omni TH homogenizer (Omni, Inc., Kennesaw, GA) and disposable tips, and centrifuged at 1500
