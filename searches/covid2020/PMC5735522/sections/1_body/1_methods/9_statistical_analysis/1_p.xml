<p id="Par43">Standard curves were performed using nucleic acids prepared from a serial dilution series of both a ZIKV-infected TCF stock (1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU/ml) and IVT RNA (10
 <sup>7</sup> to 0.1 IVT RNA copies/μl). Pearson correlation coefficients (

 </inline-formula> after regression analysis. Limit of detection with 95% confidence (LOD
 <sub>95%</sub>) was determined by statistical probit analysis (a non-linear regression model) using the commercial software SPSS 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for all assays (ZIKV prM, E, and NS2B RT-qPCR, and ZIKV E RT-iiPCR). The performance of ZIKV RT-iiPCR in spiked-in specimens was compared to the combined use of E and NS2B RT-qPCR assays; the overall degree of agreement between the assays (combined CDC E and PAHO NS2B RT-qPCR vs. RT-iiPCR) was evaluated for the total number of specimens, and also by sample type categories independently. Contingency tables (2 × 2) for ZIKV- and mock-spiked samples were generated to estimate the relative sensitivity and specificity of each assay per sample category, and compared using the McNemar’s test for paired data. The level of significance was set at 0.01.
