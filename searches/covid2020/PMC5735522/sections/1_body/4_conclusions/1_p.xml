<p id="Par61">In conclusion, the ZIKV RT-iiPCR reagent set provides comparable performance to the reference CDC and PAHO RT-qPCR assays currently in use for diagnosis of ZIKV in a variety of spiked specimen types including mosquitoes. Nonetheless, further evaluation of its performance in clinical samples derived from infected patients is warranted. In contrast to the RT-qPCR assays, the RT-iiPCR assay is fully deployable under field conditions and, thus, can be used as a PON assay in remote, resource-deprived areas to provide rapid results (~1.5 h turnaround time from sample to result) at relatively low costs (&lt; 10 USD per RT-iiPCR test vs. ≥ 20 USD per RT-qPCR test) and with the use of reagents that are stable at room temperature for two years without compromising the assay’s performance. Therefore, the ZIKV RT-iiPCR could provide a highly effective PON assay that would enhance disease management, screening of blood bank supplies, and viral surveillance in human or insect populations with an improvement of the quality of the health care system of major significance particularly in remote or low-infrastructure areas within developing countries.</p>
