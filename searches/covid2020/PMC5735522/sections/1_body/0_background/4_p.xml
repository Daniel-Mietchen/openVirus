<p id="Par29">Recently, a fluorescent probe hydrolysis-based insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) for amplification and detection of nucleic acids has been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] for a number of important pathogens including DENV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 
 <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic> in human specimens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The iiPCR is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of both DNA and RNA not only from human, but also various animal pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The PCR reaction (denaturation, annealing, and extension) is accomplished in a capillary vessel (R-tube™; GeneReach USA, Lexington, MA, USA) heated through the bottom end of the tube where, based on the Rayleigh-Bénard convection principle, the fluids cycle through temperature gradients. The results are ready in a short time (~ 1.5 h) within a field-deployable device (POCKIT™ Nucleic Acid Analyzer, GeneReach USA). Integration of the hydrolysis probe technology and an optical detection module allows automatic detection and interpretation of iiPCR results in the form of “positive” or “negative” readouts in a relatively low-cost device [
