<p id="Par30">In this study, we developed and evaluated a PON one-step RT-iiPCR reagent set targeting the E gene for the detection of ZIKV RNA from spiked-in specimens in a field-deployable system (POCKITâ„¢). The analytical sensitivity and specificity were extensively analyzed and compared to the reference CDC (prM and E genes) and PAHO (NS2B gene) singleplex RT-qPCR assays. Subsequently, the performance of the three assays was compared using ZIKV-spiked specimens (including whole blood, plasma, serum, semen, and urine) and homogenized mosquito pools.</p>
