 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], however ZIKV remained in relative obscurity for nearly 60 years until a change in its infection pattern was observed with the occurrence of the first major outbreak in Yap (Federated States of Micronesia) where approximately 74% of the population were infected and 18% of the infected people developed symptomatic disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], typically characterized by an acute, mild febrile illness of short duration. Since then, ZIKV has spread throughout the Pacific, and serosurveillance studies suggest that ZIKV infection is widespread throughout Africa, Asia, and Oceania [
