<p id="Par53">The performance of the PON ZIKV RT-iiPCR was also evaluated in ZIKV-spiked mosquito pool specimens to assess its suitability as a rapid surveillance test in the vector population. Six mosquito pools (
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 15 per pool) spiked with ZIKV PRVABC59 strain at concentrations ranging from 10
 <sup>6</sup> to 1 PFU/ml of mosquito pool homogenate (equivalent to 6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> – 0.06 PFU/mosquito) and a mock-spiked 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> pool (
 <italic>n</italic> = 15) were evaluated. Both the combined CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR and RT-iiPCR correctly identified 5/7 ZIKV- (10
 <sup>6</sup> − 10 PFU/ml) and mock-spiked mosquito pools, with the exception of that containing 1 PFU/ml (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), indicating 100% agreement between assays (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>).
