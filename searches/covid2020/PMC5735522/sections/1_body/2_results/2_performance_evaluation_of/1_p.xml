    <bold>Whole blood.</bold> Whole blood samples derived from 20 healthy individuals were spiked with different concentrations (10
    <sup>6</sup>, 10
    <sup>3</sup>, 10
    <sup>2</sup>, 10, 1 and 0 [mock] PFU/ml) of ZIKV PRVABC59 strain to simulate varying degrees of viremia titers, giving a total of 100 ZIKV-spiked and 20 mock-spiked samples. The combined use of the CDC and PAHO RT-qPCR assays (CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR) detected 60/100 ZIKV-spiked samples while none of the mock-spiked samples yielded positive results (0/20) (Additional file 
    <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). All ZIKV-spiked samples that yielded false negative results using the CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR assays (40/100) contained ≤100 PFU/ml. Among these, eight samples yielded inconclusive results with Ct &gt; 38.5 for at least one of the RT-qPCR assays, with a titer range within 10 (
    <italic>n</italic> = 6) to 1 (
    <italic>n</italic> = 2) PFU/ml of whole blood. Detection rates per viral titer are shown in Table 
    <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. In contrast, the RT-iiPCR showed a higher detection rate and identified 74/100 ZIKV-spiked samples while none of the mock-spiked samples yielded positive results (0/20). Similarly to the RT-qPCR assays, those samples that yielded false negative results (26/100) had viral titers ≤100 PFU/ml (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR and the RT-iiPCR assays showed an agreement of 90% for this sample type (k = 0.80 [CI 95%: 0.69–0.91]) (Table

    <bold>Plasma.</bold> Plasma samples derived from 20 healthy individuals were spiked with different concentrations of ZIKV PRVABC59 strain as previously indicated, giving a total of 100 ZIKV-spiked and 20 mock-spiked samples. The combined CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR detected 74/100 ZIKV-spiked samples while none of the mock-spiked samples yielded positive results (0/20) (Additional file 
    <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). All samples that yielded false negative results using the CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR assays (26/100) contained ≤100 PFU/ml of ZIKV PRVABC59 strain. Among these, five samples yielded inconclusive results with Ct &gt; 38.5 for at least one of the RT-qPCR assays, all of which had a titer of 1 PFU/ml (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). In contrast, the RT-iiPCR demonstrated a higher detection rate and identified 86/100 ZIKV-spiked samples while none of the mock-spiked samples yielded positive results (0/20). Similarly to the RT-qPCR assays, those samples that yielded false negative results (14/100) had viral titers ≤100 PFU/ml (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The agreement between the CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR and the RT-iiPCR assays was 92% (k = 0.82 [CI 95%: 0.71–0.93]) (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>), higher than that observed with whole blood samples.

    <bold>Serum.</bold> Serum samples derived from 20 healthy individuals were spiked with different concentrations of ZIKV PRVABC59 strain as previously indicated, giving a total of 100 ZIKV-spiked and 20 mock-spiked samples. The combined CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR detected 78/100 ZIKV-spiked samples while none of the mock-spiked samples yielded positive results (0/20) (Additional file 
    <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). All samples that yielded false negative results using the CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR assays (22/100) were spiked with ≤10 PFU/ml of ZIKV PRVABC59 strain (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), which demonstrated a lower detection limit compared to other blood-derived specimens (i.e. whole blood and plasma). Among these, nine samples yielded inconclusive results with Ct &gt; 38.5 for at least one of the RT-qPCR assays, with 7/9 having a titer of 1 PFU/ml and 2/9 having a titer of 10 PFU/ml. In contrast, the RT-iiPCR showed a higher detection rate and identified 90/100 ZIKV-spiked samples while none of the mock-spiked samples yielded positive results (0/20). Those samples that yielded false negative results (10/100) had viral titers of 1 PFU/ml (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The highest level of agreement between assays was observed for this sample type among other blood-derived specimens (95%; k = 0.86 [CI 95%: 0.76–0.97]) (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). Even though the RT-iiPCR had a higher detection rate than the RT-qPCR assays, both assays consistently detected viral RNA in samples containing as low as 100 PFU/ml of virus.

    <bold>Semen.</bold> Since it has been recently demonstrated that ZIKV can be sexually transmitted from infected individuals, we assessed the performance of the ZIKV RT-iiPCR in spiked semen samples. Each of a total of 4 pooled semen samples (semen from three individuals per pool [total of 12 semen samples]) were spiked with 10
    <sup>6</sup>, 10
    <sup>3</sup>, 10
    <sup>2</sup>, 10, 1 and 0 (mock) PFU/ml of ZIKV PRVABC59 strain (
    <italic>n</italic> = 24). The CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR detected 15/20 ZIKV-spiked samples while none of the negative samples yielded positive results (0/4) (Additional file 
    <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). One out of the 5 false negative results obtained using the CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR assays contained a viral titer of 10 PFU/ml, while the other samples that yielded negative results had viral titers of 1 PFU/ml of semen (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The RT-iiPCR detected 17/20 positive samples and 0/4 negative samples. The three ZIKV-spiked samples that were undetectable had viral titers of 1 PFU/ml (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). In summary, the agreement between the two assays was 92% (k = 0.81 [CI 95%: 0.57–1]) (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>).

    <bold>Urine.</bold> Urine samples derived from 20 healthy individuals were spiked with different concentrations of ZIKV PRVABC59 strain as previously indicated, giving a total of 100 ZIKV-spiked and 20 mock-spiked samples. The combined CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR detected 57/100 ZIKV-spiked samples while none of the mock-spiked samples yielded positive results (0/20) (Additional file 
    <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). All samples that yielded false negative results (43/100) were spiked with ≤100 PFU/ml of ZIKV PRVABC59 strain (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Among the eight samples that yielded inconclusive results (Ct &gt; 38.5 for at least one of the RT-qPCR assays), 5/8 and 3/8 had a titer of 10 PFU/ml and 100 PFU/ml, respectively. In contrast, the RT-iiPCR showed a higher detection rate and identified 73/100 ZIKV-spiked samples while none of the mock-spiked samples yielded positive results (0/20). Those samples that yielded false negative results (27/100) had viral titers ≤10 PFU/ml (Table
