<p id="Par54">Analysis of a total of 481 spiked and mock-spiked whole blood, plasma, serum, semen, urine, and mosquito pool specimens (excluding samples that yielded inconclusive RT-qPCR results) determined an overall agreement of 92% (k = 0.83 [CI 95%: 0.77–0.88]) between the ZIKV RT-iiPCR and the CDC and PAHO ZIKV RT-qPCR assays (Table

Even though there is no consensus gold standard test for the diagnosis of ZIKV infection in different clinical specimens, contingency analysis of ZIKV- and mock-spiked specimens demonstrated that the ZIKV RT-iiPCR had a higher sensitivity than the composite results obtained from the CDC-PAHO RT-qPCR assays for the detection of viral RNA in whole blood, plasma, and urine samples (McNemar’s test,
