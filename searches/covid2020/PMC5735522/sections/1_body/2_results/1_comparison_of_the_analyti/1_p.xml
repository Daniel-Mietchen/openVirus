    <bold>Analytical sensitivity</bold>. The analytical sensitivity of the PON ZIKV RT-iiPCR was determined using a (a) ten-fold dilution series (six replicates per dilution) of ZIKV IVT RNA (10
    <sup>7</sup> to 0.1 IVT RNA copies/μl) containing the target sequence, and (b) ten-fold serial dilutions (10
    <sup>0</sup>–10
    <sup>−13</sup>) of nucleic acid extracted from TCF derived from ZIKV PRVABC59-infected Vero cells containing a viral titer of 10
    <sup>7</sup> PFU/ml. These samples were also used to determine the analytical sensitivities of the CDC-validated prM and E, and PAHO-validated NS2B ZIKV RT-qPCR assays (Tables 
    <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
    <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Standard curves generated for the three RT-qPCR assays using both a serial dilution of infectious TCF and IVT RNA demonstrated perfect linearity (

    <sup>
     <italic>2</italic>
    </sup> &gt; 0.99) and optimal amplification efficiencies ranging between 97% and 105% (data not shown). For the ZIKV IVT RNA serial dilution, the RT-iiPCR showed 100%, 83%, 83%, 17%, and 0% detection rates for reaction mixtures containing 1000; 100; 10; 1; and 0.1 IVT RNA copies/μl, respectively (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), and a 100% detection endpoint at 10 PFU/ml of infectious TCF (PRVABC59 strain, Table 
    <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Probit analysis determined that the limit of detection 95% (LOD
    <sub>95%</sub>) of the ZIKV RT-iiPCR was 130 copies/μl of ZIKV IVT RNA. Regarding the CDC and PAHO RT-qPCR assays, the 100% detection endpoints were found at 10,000 IVT RNA copies/μl and 100 PFU/ml of infectious TCF for the prM RT-qPCR assay, 100 IVT RNA copies/μl and 10 PFU/ml of infectious TCF for the E RT-qPCR assay, and 10 IVT RNA copies/μl and 10 PFU/ml of infectious TCF for the NS2B RT-qPCR assay, respectively (Tables 
    <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
    <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). LOD
    <sub>95%</sub> was estimated at 4102; 21; and 6 IVT RNA copies/μl for the prM, E, and NS2B RT-qPCR assays, respectively. Therefore, the overall analytical sensitivity of the ZIKV RT-iiPCR was comparable to that of the CDC E and PAHO NS2B RT-qPCR assays in detecting viral RNA, while having a higher performance when compared to that of the CDC prM RT-qPCR assay.

    <bold>Analytical specificity</bold>. The specificity and pan-reactivity of the ZIKV CDC and PAHO RT-qPCR and RT-iiPCR assays were evaluated using a panel of reference viral RNA from different ZIKV strains (African and Asian lineages) as well as other flaviviruses and alphaviruses that frequently cause similar clinical symptoms including DENV serotypes 1–4, WNV, YFV, and CHIKV (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The CDC prM and PAHO NS2B RT-qPCR assays were able to detect all ZIKV strains from the Asian lineage. However, the PAHO NS2B RT-qPCR assay did not successfully amplify RNA derived from strains belonging to the African lineage (MR 766 and IB H 30656) while the CDC prM RT-qPCR assay was able to detect the IB H 30656 strain but not the MR 766 strain (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The CDC E RT-qPCR and the RT-iiPCR assays successfully detected all ZIKV strains from both lineages (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Moreover, the RT-iiPCR detected ZIKV RNA (PRVABC59 and FLR [Asian lineage], and MR766 [African lineage] strains) derived from both infected mammalian (Vero) and mosquito (C6/36 and AP-61) cell lines. All assays were highly specific and did not detect any other related flaviviruses or CHIKV (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).
