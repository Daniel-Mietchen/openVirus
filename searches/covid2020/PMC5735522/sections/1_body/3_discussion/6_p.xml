<p id="Par60">In this study, the ZIKV-specific RT-iiPCR assay demonstrated a comparable analytical sensitivity and specificity to reference RT-qPCR assays that have been validated by CDC and PAHO for diagnosis of this flaviviral infection in humans. The ZIKV RT-iiPCR targets a conserved region within the E gene and while it is capable of detecting ZIKV strains from both Asian and African lineages, it showed no reactivity with genomic RNA from other flaviviruses or CHIKV. Regarding the assay’s performance in spiked specimens, the RT-iiPCR demonstrated a substantial level of agreement with the reference RT-qPCR assays (92%, k = 0.83). The best performance for both the RT-iiPCR and the reference RT-qPCR assays was observed for plasma, serum, semen, and mosquito pools, with levels of agreement higher than 90%. In the case of ZIKV-spiked whole blood, plasma, and urine, false negative results were frequently observed for both the RT-iiPCR and reference RT-qPCR assays in those samples containing ≤100 PFU/ml of ZIKV. Such limitations in the detection of viral RNA in these samples were consistent with results from previous studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]; and may be associated with sample volume, the presence of PCR inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], or extremely low concentrations of target RNA. Even though limited sample volumes may have an impact on the assay’s performance, the use of a reduced volume of semen samples in this study (100 μl) did not appear to have detrimental effects on the results. Although this study suggests that serum may be a more suitable sample for PCR-based testing of ZIKV than whole blood or plasma, this needs to be further evaluated using clinical samples from naturally infected patients.
