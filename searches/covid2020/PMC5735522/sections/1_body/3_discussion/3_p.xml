<p id="Par57">The POCKIT™ system can be combined with field-deployable manual or automatic nucleic acid extraction systems (PetNAD™ Nucleic Acid Co-prep Kit or taco™ mini Nucleic Acid automated extraction system [taco™ mini], GeneReach USA) or other column-based extraction systems of choice. Accordingly, a taco™ mini (30 × 26.5 × 26 cm, W x D x H, 5 kg) and a POCKIT™ device (31 × 26 × 15 cm, W x D x H, 2.1 kg) have been combined for field applications (POCKIT™ Combo), and can be powered by a car or rechargeable battery. The POCKIT™ Combo has been accepted as a mobile PCR tool in the management of animal health. Also, a hand-held model, POCKIT™ Micro Plus (6.3 × 15.2 × 5.0 cm, W x D x H; 0.3 kg; GeneReach USA) has been developed for field applications. Recently, feasibility of the combination of POCKIT™ Micro Plus and the automatic taco™ mini was demonstrated in a field test carried out in Vietnam for monitoring avian influenza A viruses in poultry markets. Test results using a influenza A RT-iiPCR reagent set were comparable to those of an RT-qPCR in a central laboratory (unpublished data). Furthermore, we have clearly demonstrated that this platform can be used for dengue and MERS-CoV diagnosis in human clinical samples [
