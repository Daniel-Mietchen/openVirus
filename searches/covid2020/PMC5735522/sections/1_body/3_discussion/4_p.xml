<p id="Par58">To date, three other PON assays based on the use of either biomolecular sensors/CRISPR-based technology, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), or reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification (RT-SIBA) technologies have been described for detection of ZIKV RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. While these methods provide rapid, on-site results, they offer a limited sensitivity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], limited specificity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], or have not been compared to the CDC or PAHO-validated RT-qPCR of routine use in diagnostic laboratories [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In addition, their performance has not been evaluated in a large set of specimens. Instead, the ZIKV RT-iiPCR assay involves the use of a technology specifically developed for field application and which has already been validated for detection of several major pathogens in clinical samples, and is based on the TaqMan® chemistry which is less likely to yield false positive results.
