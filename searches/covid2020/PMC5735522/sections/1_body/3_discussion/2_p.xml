<p id="Par56">Even though there are two CDC-validated and one PAHO-validated RT-qPCR assays for molecular diagnosis of ZIKV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], these are not suitable for use within clinical settings in rural areas or may not be available in areas with limited resources including developing countries where ZIKV is spreading at an accelerated rate. This disease, among other mosquito-borne infections, adds impetus to the development of accurate, rapid, inexpensive, and on-site detection methodologies (i.e. PON) that can aid in the clinical management of affected patients, disease surveillance, and control of epidemics in vulnerable areas and also ensure rapid testing of blood and blood products in blood banks. Here, we report the development and evaluation of a PON molecular detection test (RT-iiPCR assay) for the detection of ZIKV RNA in diverse human specimens that are likely to be encountered under field conditions. Furthermore, we determined that this assay is appropriate for detection of ZIKV RNA in homogenized mosquito pools, demonstrating its potential utility for monitoring viral prevalence in vector populations. This assay is based on the iiPCR technology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], and it is designed for use in conjunction with a fully field-deployable device (POCKIT™ Nucleic Acid Analyzer, GeneReach USA) that allows rapid amplification and detection of viral nucleic acids (~1.5 h from sample to result, including nucleic acid extraction time [Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>]). A number of iiPCR-based assays have been developed for detection of human and animal pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] with two of the most recent additions being directed against all serotypes of DENV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The sensitivity and specificity of all iiPCR-based assays have demonstrated to be comparable with other diagnostic methods currently in use (e.g. RT-qPCR, nested PCR, virus isolation). However, RT-iiPCR offers several advantages over conventional molecular-based assays (e.g. RT-qPCR assays) including lyophilized reagents that can be transported at ambient temperature, ease of reaction setup, automated detection and simple result interpretation in the form of “+” (positive result) or “-” (negative result), and rapid results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
