  <p>POCKIT™ system workflow for point-of-need detection of Zika virus RNA. This system includes a compact automatic nucleic acid extraction device (taco™ mini) and a portable PCR device (POCKIT™). After sample collection, nucleic acids are extracted using a preloaded extraction plate in approximately 30 min and, subsequently, the lyophilized RT-iiPCR reaction is reconstituted and nucleic acids are added and tested. TaqMan® probe hydrolysis-based amplification signals are detected and automatically processed, providing qualitative results on the display screen after 60 min</p>
