 <p>MC designed experiments, prepared the spiked clinical samples, performed RT-iiPCR and RT-qPCR assays and drafted the manuscript; YL propagated and titrated various ZIKV strains used in this study and helped to prepare spiked clinical samples and performed virus nucleic acid extractions, PAL performed data analysis and drafted the manuscript with MC; CFT and PHC designed and developed the ZIKV RT-iiPCR reagents; DW provided the human blood samples; AS helped MC to establish the CDC and PAHO RT-qPCR assays in the laboratory; RFC is the Co-PI and helped to write the manuscript; GB provided the mosquitoes; HGC and HTW are project leaders at GeneReach USA, and they coordinated and supervised the ZIKV RT-iiPCR assay development; and UBRB (principal investigator) conceived the idea to develop a PON assay for the detection of ZIKV RNA in clinical specimens and collaborated with GeneReach USA, secured funding for the project from the College of Agriculture, Food and Environment and the Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky, designed the experiments, directed and supervised the project, and edited the manuscript.
