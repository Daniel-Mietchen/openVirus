         <p id="Par1">The recent emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil and its precipitous expansion
            throughout the Americas has highlighted the urgent need for a rapid and reliable on-site
            diagnostic assay suitable for viral detection. Such point-of-need (PON), low-cost
            diagnostics are essential for ZIKV control in vulnerable areas with limited resources.

         <p id="Par2">We developed and evaluated a ZIKV-specific field-deployable RT-iiPCR reagent set targeting
            the E gene for rapid detection of ZIKV in ZIKV-spiked human and mosquito specimens,
            and compared its performance to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
            and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) RT-qPCR assays targeting the E and NS2B
            genes, respectively.

         <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Results</div>
         <p id="Par3">These assays demonstrated exclusive specificity for ZIKV (African and Asian lineages),
            had limits of detection ranging from 10 to 100 in vitro transcribed RNA copies/μl
            and detection endpoints at 10 plaque forming units/ml of infectious tissue culture
            fluid. Analysis of human whole blood, plasma, serum, semen, urine, and mosquito pool
            samples spiked with ZIKV showed an agreement of 90% (k = 0.80), 92% (k = 0.82), 95%
            (k = 0.86), 92% (k = 0.81), 90% (k = 0.79), and 100% (k = 1), respectively, between
            the RT-iiPCR assay and composite results from the reference RT-qPCR assays. Overall,
            the concurrence between the ZIKV RT-iiPCR and the reference RT-qPCR assays was 92%
            (k = 0.83).

         <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Conclusions</div>
         <p id="Par4">The ZIKV RT-iiPCR has a performance comparable to the reference CDC and PAHO RT-qPCR
            assays but provides much faster results (~1.5 h) with a field-deployable system that
            can be utilized as a PON diagnostic with the potential to significantly improve the
            quality of the health care system in vulnerable areas.
