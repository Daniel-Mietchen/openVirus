   <sup>a</sup>Each quantitative indicator was evaluated as the proportion (expressed as percentage) of the outcome of interest over the total. A scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each quantitative indicator as follows: &lt; 60% (from the above calculation) scored 1 (weak performance); 60–79% scored 2 (moderate performance); ≥80% scored 3 (good performance). For indicators for which a proportion over a total could not be obtained (qualitative indicators) a score was assigned based on the same scale using expert consensus
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>b</sup>Indicator value calculated by dividing the number of achieved outcome by the total number of outcome considered (i.e. 4/5 = 80.0% or 1/4 = 25.0%)
