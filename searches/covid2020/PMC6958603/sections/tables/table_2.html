  <p>Abbreviations: 
   <i>ILI</i> influenza-like-illness; 
   <i>SARI</i> severe acute respiratory illness;

   <sup>a</sup>Each quantitative indicator was evaluated as the proportion (expressed as percentage) of the outcome of interest over the total (indicator value). A scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each quantitative indicator as follows: &lt; 60% (from the above calculation) scored 1 (weak performance); 60–79% scored 2 (moderate performance); ≥80% scored 3 (good performance) 
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>b</sup>Key variables evaluated for completeness and consistency of data: site, age/date of birth, sex, date of consultation/admission, date of symptoms onset, date of sample collection and signs and symptoms included in the case definitions 
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>c</sup>The target period was 48 h from sites situated in Lusaka Province and 14 days from sites situated in Copperbelt Province
