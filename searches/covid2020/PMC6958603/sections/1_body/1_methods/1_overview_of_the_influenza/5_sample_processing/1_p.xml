<p id="Par29">At the NIC, samples and accompanying CIFs were logged by recording key data in the laboratory log book. Specimens were tested for the presence of influenza viruses using the U.S. CDC real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocol for characterization of influenza viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. During 2011–2012, all specimens from children aged &lt; 5 years with SARI were tested for other respiratory viruses including parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2 and 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus (OC43, NL63, 229E, HKU1) and bocavirus using an FTD multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Since 2012, RT-PCR influenza-positive samples with a cycle threshold value &lt; 28 were cultured at the NIC, after which further viral identification of the samples was done using Haemagglutination (HA) and Haemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) testing. Confirmed virus isolates were shared with WHO Collaborating Centers for further characterization; both viral isolates and clinical specimens were shared twice a year.
