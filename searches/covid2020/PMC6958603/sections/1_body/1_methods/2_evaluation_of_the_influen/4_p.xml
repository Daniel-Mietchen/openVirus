For instance, for the indicator on completeness of laboratory testing (one of the indicators used to evaluate the data quality and completeness attribute) we divided the number of samples with available influenza results by the total number of samples collected and received by the laboratory. Subsequently, similar to other influenza surveillance evaluations conducted in Africa, we used a scale from 1 to 3 to provide a score for each quantitative indicator as follows: &lt; 60% (as obtained in the example above) scored 1 (weak performance); 60–79% scored 2 (moderate performance); ≥80% scored 3 (good performance) [
