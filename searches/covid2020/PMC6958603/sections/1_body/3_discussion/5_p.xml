<p id="Par53">The flexibility of the system was demonstrated by its ability to investigate the viral etiology of pathogens other than influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. While the recruitment of dedicated surveillance officers may not be justifiable for a vertical influenza surveillance program it may be considered for an integrated multi-pathogen surveillance platform. This could be potentially cost-beneficial for a sentinel surveillance system where a limited number of surveillance officers may be needed in selected sentinel sites as compared to national passive surveillance programs. Integrated and well-run multi-pathogen surveillance systems, if adequately staffed may provide high quality and timely epidemiological and virological data with a “modest” financial investment. The national burden of illness attributable to specific pathogens can be estimated from sentinel surveillance data through special studies as demonstrated in Zambia and other African countries for influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This would be particularly relevant for policy makers if multiple pathogens are included so as to provide the relative burden associated with different etiological agents. Risk factors for influenza-associated severe illness (e.g. hospitalization or death) have also been assessed using sentinel surveillance systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and this could be implemented also in Zambia for influenza and other pathogens.
