<p id="Par20">Seasonal influenza virus infections are responsible for an estimated 291,243â€“645,832 respiratory deaths globally every year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Influenza infections have been described in Zambia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] since the 1990s, but because of limited laboratory diagnostic capacity prior to 2008 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], little was known about the contribution of influenza viruses to the respiratory disease burden, rendering difficult public health planning for the prevention and control of influenza-associated illness. At present, no influenza treatment or immunization guidelines are available in Zambia, and no measures for mitigating the transmission and disease burden associated with influenza infection are in place.
