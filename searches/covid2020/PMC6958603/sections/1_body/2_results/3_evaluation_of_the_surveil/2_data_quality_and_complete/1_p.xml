<p id="Par40">During the evaluation period, of the seven data indicators, six had good performance and one had moderate performance (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Approximately 70% of identified SARI cases were enrolled in the surveillance program, while the enrollment target was 100%. The enrollment target for ILI cases was exceeded (140% of the target of 5 cases per week and per facility). More than 90% of CIF were accurately completed for key variables (including site, age/date of birth, sex, date of consultation/admission, date of symptoms onset, date of sample collection and signs and symptoms included in the case definitions) and more than 90% of samples collected had available influenza results and a positive ribonucleic protein result (an indicator of presence of human mucosal cells in the sample). The proportion of collected variables included in the WHO minimum data collection standard was 82.3%. Information on the use of antivirals and the presence of some underlying medical conditions were not included in the patientsâ€™ CIFs. The mean score for data quality and completeness was 2.9 (moderate to good performance) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
