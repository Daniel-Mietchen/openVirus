<p id="Par46">During the evaluation period, of the eight indicators, five had good performance and three had moderate performance (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). All surveillance sites provided samples weekly during the evaluation period. The main aspects that affected stability were elevated frequencies of electricity cuts and generator failures. Approximately 30% of surveillance staff did not receive annual refresher training during the last year and approximately 30% of expected weekly reports were not sent to the Zambia MoH within the expected time frame (one week from the end of the reported period). The mean score for stability was 2.6 (moderate to good performance) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
