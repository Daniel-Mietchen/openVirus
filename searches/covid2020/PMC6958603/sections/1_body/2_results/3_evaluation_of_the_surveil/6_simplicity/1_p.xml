<p id="Par44">During the evaluation period, of the seven indicators, six had good performance and one (time of enrollment of SARI/ILI cases) had moderate performance (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The six indicators used to assess the perception of surveillance personnel at sentinel sites to implement different surveillance activities were rated well by responding personnel. Over 31% of staff, however, reported that surveillance procedures from the identification of cases to the final packaging of samples took &gt; 30 min, showing only moderate performance. The mean score for simplicity was 2.8 (moderate to good performance) (Table
