Controls were age-group-matched children randomly selected from communities surrounding study sites. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP), urine, blood, induced sputum, lung aspirate, pleural fluid, and gastric aspirates were tested with cultures, multiplex PCR, or both. Primary analyses were restricted to cases without HIV infection and with abnormal chest x-rays and to controls without HIV infection. We applied a Bayesian, partial latent class analysis to estimate probabilities of aetiological agents at the individual and population level, incorporating case and control data.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 cases and 5119 community controls.

Wheezing was present in 555 (31&#x000b7;7%) of 1752 cases (range by site 10&#x000b7;6&#x02013;97&#x000b7;3%). 30-day case-fatality ratio was 6&#x000b7;4% (114 of 1769 cases). Blood cultures were positive in 56 (3&#x000b7;2%) of 1749 cases, and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> was the most common bacteria isolated (19 [33&#x000b7;9%] of 56). Almost all cases (98&#x000b7;9%) and controls (98&#x000b7;0%) had at least one pathogen detected by PCR in the NP-OP specimen. The detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, <italic>S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b (Hib), <italic>H influenzae</italic> non-type b, and <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> in NP-OP specimens was associated with case status.

Additionally, we established an expert panel, the Pneumonia Methods Working Group (PMWG), to provide additional advice on the key epidemiological, laboratory, study design, and analytical issues that the PERCH study needed to optimise. The search dates, databases used, search terms, and restrictions are detailed in a separate publication (Zunera Gilani and colleagues, 2012). The results of our reviews of the pre-existing evidence and the decisions reached by the PMWG have been published in a set of methods papers and in the protocol. Since this review, the descriptive results of three large paediatric pneumonia aetiology studies in children younger than 5 years have been published&#x02014;from the USA (EPIC), South Africa (Drakenstein), and a multicountry study (GABRIEL)&#x02014;and were considered in our analysis.</p><p id="para60"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para70">The PERCH study is a comprehensive, systematic, multisite study of the causes of severe and very severe pneumonia with hospital admission among children aged 1&#x02013;59 months in the context of routine use of <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The emphasis on a single protocol with highly standardised implementation and quality control steps throughout the study conduct, the inclusion of diverse sites but with routine implementation of existing pneumonia vaccines, the duration of enrolment to capture seasonal trends, the use of a 33-target multiplex quantitative PCR, the inclusion of multiple body fluid specimens, the inclusion of an appropriate control group, the adjustment for the sensitivity of the laboratory tests, and the large size of the study all provided strength to the inferential value of the results. Our study provides results for over 30 pathogens and allows for cross-site comparisons of aetiological distribution because of its highly standardised methodology. It is the first infectious aetiology study to integrate the results of testing of multiple pathogens from multiple body fluid specimens, by using a range of laboratory assays, and to provide an aetiological distribution of the pathogens, with uncertainty intervals, both by individual and in the population. Our results showed that ten pathogens were responsible for 79&#x02013;90% of cases with severe pneumonia requiring hospital admission in children younger than 5 years across a wide range of geographical and epidemiological settings. Causes of pneumonia varied by age strata and severity status and, to a lesser degree, by geography.</p><p id="para80"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para90">From a policy perspective, the low number of pathogens that are common causes of pneumonia requiring hospital admission in children younger than 5 years across all sites could allow for targeted development of pneumonia interventions. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common cause of disease and should be a primary target for dedicated prevention and treatment efforts, especially for children younger than 6 months. Bacterial pathogens, cumulatively, caused a substantial proportion of disease and, being treatable and commonly fatal, should remain a target for early access to treatment. Our study clearly shows that the inferential value of nasopharyngeal specimens varies by pathogen, with only a low number of pathogens providing evidence of causality. The PERCH Integrated Analysis shows the value of analytical approaches that account for pathogen prevalence, test performance, multiple specimens, and multiple results for an individual pathogen. The methods developed by the PERCH study for integrating such data, in a principled approach, offer the opportunity for other aetiology studies to also adapt and use these methods.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para100">Here, we report the descriptive clinical and microbiological findings of the PERCH study using a traditional analytical approach, so that results can be compared with those of other pneumonia studies. Acknowledging that aetiology cannot be inferred from these results alone, we also developed a new analytical approach to assess the aetiological distribution of pneumonia.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This approach integrates microbiology results from multiple specimens types and multiple results for one pathogen from an individual; this approach also accounts for the sensitivity and specificity of the individual diagnostic tests used.

Sensitivity analyses were done to assess the influence of the values used for aetiology and sensitivity priors (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). To allow for the possibility that the pneumonia event was caused by a pathogen not tested for, we included a pathogen category termed not otherwise specified (NOS).

For cases with multiple pathogens detected in silver standard measurements (eg, blood cultures, lung aspirates, or pleural fluid), the model cannot distinguish which one is the dominant cause. For these cases, the model distributes the aetiology probability equally across the pathogens detected. This distribution leads to an underestimation of the contribution of the true cause of the disease because the sum of the pathogen probabilities for an individual case in this primary pathogen model must be 100%. For cases who are negative by silver standard measurements, the cause is distributed across multiple pathogens according to the strength of evidence for each pathogen. This evidence includes whether the pathogen was detected in multiple samples from the individual, the pathogen's prevalence among cases, the pathogen's odds ratio, and a-priori assumptions regarding sensitivity and aetiology.</p><p id="para280">As a Bayesian analysis, we assigned a-priori estimates for both the aetiology distribution and the sensitivity of each laboratory measurement.

The secondary all-case aetiology analysis (ie, regardless of x-ray findings) included 3968 cases and 5075 controls with at least one microbiology test result (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>); of the 3972 cases with at least one test result, four cases who tested positive for measles by NP-OP PCR (all without an infiltrate on their chest x-rays) were excluded from the all-case analysis.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Case (A) and control (B) enrolment and specimen availability profile</p><p>CXR=chest x-ray.

GA=gastric aspirate. *Of the 88 children not enrolled because of other reasons, 45 were not enrolled because of an enrolment cap at the Mali site, ten because of political unrest in Bangladesh, and 24 in Kenya and nine in Zambia because of reasons not stated. &#x02020;Included in clinical descriptive analysis. &#x02021;Lung aspirate and pleural fluid specimens were collected on a subset of cases eligible for the procedures; for samples with low volumes, only culture was done. &#x000a7;Measles testing was done on a subset of cases who met the study defined clinical criteria for measles. &#x000b6;Included in laboratory descriptive analysis and aetiology analysis; at least one of the following specimens was required for a child to be included in the aetiology analysis: blood culture, NP-OP PCR, WB PCR, or tuberculosis culture for cases; and NP-OP PCR or WB PCR for controls. ||Number contacted, screened, and eligible includes some extrapolated data for the Zambia and South Africa sites; data were available for 16 of 24 months for Zambia and 10&#x000b7;5 of 24 months for South Africa; for each of these sites, available data were used to extrapolate numbers for the months with missing data assuming that contact, participation, and eligibility rates were constant over time.**Not shown here are an additional 206 controls with HIV infection enrolled from HIV clinics at the South Africa and Zambia sites to ensure adequate sample size of children with HIV infection; these children will be described in forthcoming manuscripts devoted to the causes of severe and very severe pneumonia in children with HIV infection. &#x02020;&#x02020;Data for total number of children contacted and number of children who declined or did not show to clinic were not available for the Mali site. &#x02021;&#x02021;Among sites with available data for total number of children contacted (ie, all sites except Mali), 8149 (73&#x000b7;9%) of 11&#x02008;033 randomly selected children or households were contacted; the number of children or guardians contacted is used as the denominator for the percentage of children screened, eligible, and enrolled; because the denominator excludes Mali but the numerator does not, the percentages for screened, eligible, and enrolled are overestimated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><table-wrap position="float"

Positive cases are those with a positive chest x-ray. p values obtained from logistic regression models adjusted for age in months (all variables expect age category) and site for cases with a positive x-ray versus controls. Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine formulation varied by site: pentavalent vaccine (DTP-Hib-HepB) was used in Kenya, Gambia, Mali, Zambia, and Bangladesh; DTP-only and DTP-HepB was used in Thailand; and pentaxim (DTaP-Hib-IPV) was used in South Africa. During the study, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was in routine use in Kenya (introduced February, 2011), The Gambia (August, 2009), Mali (March, 2011), and South Africa (April, 2009); PCV was introduced in Zambia in July, 2013 (Lusaka), 3 months before the end of study enrolment. Duration of illness was defined as duration (in days) of cough, wheeze, fever, or difficulty breathing, whichever was longest. Tachypnoea was defined as 60 or more breaths per min (&#x0003c;2 months), 50 or more breaths per min (2&#x02013;11 months), and 40 or more breaths per min (12&#x02013;59 months). Hypoxaemia was defined as oxygen saturation lower than 92% (or &#x0003c;90% for sites at elevation above 1200 m: Zambia and South Africa), or supplemental oxygen use if a room air oxygen saturation reading was not available; a room air oxygen saturation reading was available for 3514 (88&#x000b7;3%) children; the South African site, at an altitude of 1600 m above sea level, had a standard clinical practice to administer supplemental oxygen for all children admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia. Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count was defined as greater than 15&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;109 cells per L for children aged 1&#x02013;11 months and greater than 13&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;109 cells per L for children aged 12&#x02013;59 months.

In each site, a small number of pathogens accounted for most cases admitted to hospital with radiographically confirmed pneumonia; the ten most common pathogens at a given site accounted for 79% or more of cases of disease at that site.

Additionally, for these and all bacterial pathogens, we directly sampled from the lung (albeit in few cases), optimised and adjusted for the volume of blood for culture, accounted for the effect of previous antibiotic exposure on the sensitivity of bacterial pathogen detection for blood cultures, and accounted for the low sensitivity of blood cultures.</p><p id="para540">About 3% of cases in the PERCH study had a non-contaminant organisms isolated from blood culture. <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> was the most common isolate, consistent with other childhood pneumonia aetiology studies.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Although we attempted to improve identification of cases with true pneumococcal pneumonia using whole blood PCR,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> the specificity was poor because prevalence was similar between cases and controls (aOR 1&#x000b7;2); this improved somewhat when bacterial load was considered (aOR 1&#x000b7;6).

Economic development and improved access to care might also have reduced hospital admissions for pneumococcal pneumonia through effective early outpatient treatment. In some sites, such as Thailand, the absence of any detected cases of pneumococcal bacteraemia might simply reflect low enrolment numbers, given that invasive pneumococcal disease has been observed at this site in other studies.<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p><p id="para560">Among other vaccine-preventable pathogens, <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> burden varied by site, accounting for 6&#x02013;10% of the aetiology in four sites (The Gambia, Zambia, South Africa, and Thailand), but less than 3% elsewhere. <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> was rarely cultured from induced sputum or gastric aspirates and, in the South Africa site, testing more than one specimen increased the yield.<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> The sensitivity of <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> culture is low when testing a single induced sputum specimen (30%) and remains low even when multiple samples were taken from children with pulmonary tuberculosis;<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> this was accounted for in the aetiology model.

This emphasises that strong evidence exists for the aetiological contribution of pathogens tested for in our study, unless there is substantial confounding of the true cause by these pathogens. Because the value chosen for the aetiology prior influences the fraction attributed to the NOS category, our analysis cannot be used to estimate precisely the size of the NOS category. However, it does affirm that NOS accounts for a small fraction of pneumonia causes.</p><p id="para590">The contribution of NP-OP data for assessing aetiological probability depends on differences in frequency of detection between cases and controls. The validity of NP-OP infection as a source of aetiological inference for a selected group of pneumonia pathogens is supported by the finding that clear distinctions in prevalence by case or control status were found consistently across sites. However, NP-OP specimens provide little inferential value to the cause of pneumonia at the individual case level, except for a small group of pathogens, such as RSV and <italic>B pertussis</italic>.

Despite their limitations, NP-OP specimens remain of substantial importance for pneumonia aetiology studies because they are easily collected, can be subjected to molecular diagnostic testing, and can provide valid information about infection of certain pathogens in the respiratory tract.</p><p id="para600">Four sites (The Gambia, South Africa, Mali, and Bangladesh) included lung aspirate specimen collection as part of the study protocol.

Pathogen detection from lung aspirates was lower (29% overall, 41% when both culture and PCR were undertaken) than that reported in previous studies, possibly because the timing of lung aspirates occurred after antibiotic administration.<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> Pleural fluid specimens, included in the study protocol in all sites at the discretion of the treating clinicians, were only available from 15 (8%) of 180 cases in whom at least one standardised chest x-ray reader identified pleural fluid; however, a pathogen was detected in 80% of these specimens.

Study design and methodological differences probably affected the rate of RSV detection; specifically, the age distribution of cases enrolled in GABRIEL was older than that of cases in PERCH, and GABRIEL controls were enrolled from facilities, rather than from the community. Although <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> detection in NP specimens in cases was similar between the two studies (68% in GABRIEL <italic>vs</italic> 73% in PERCH [any detection]), the control prevalence was considerably lower in GABRIEL (48% <italic>vs</italic> 77%), resulting in a high OR and attributable fraction in the GABRIEL study. The difference in pneumococcal findings between the PERCH and GABRIEL studies is unlikely to lie in the case definitions used, which were similar between studies. Instead, notable differences existed in PCV use (nearly absent in GABRIEL, but widely used in PERCH) and in control eligibility (facility-based recruitment and no respiratory symptoms in GABRIEL <italic>vs</italic> community controls regardless of respiratory symptoms, if not case-defining, in PERCH). Additionally, the proportion of cases and controls who had detection of both viruses and bacteria was substantially higher in PERCH (83&#x000b7;5% cases and 75&#x000b7;8% of controls had mixed bacterial-viral detection) than in GABRIEL (59&#x000b7;6% cases and 36&#x000b7;1% controls), suggesting that other differences in the selection of participants or in clinical or laboratory methods might have also contributed. In the EPIC study<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> of childhood pneumonia aetiology from the USA, RSV and human rhinovirus were the most commonly detected pathogens from the upper respiratory tract among young children hospitalised with radiographic pneumonia, and a larger proportion of children had no pathogen detected compared with that of PERCH (18&#x000b7;9% in EPIC <italic>vs</italic> 0&#x000b7;9% in PERCH). In the South African Drakenstein case-control substudy<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> of pneumonia aetiology (using the same multiplex PCR assay as PERCH), cases were predominantly children with non-severe pneumonia, managed in outpatient settings, and with a median age of 5 months. Nevertheless, a range of pathogens similar to that of the PERCH study was associated with pneumonia case status, but the prevalence of influenza was higher. Unlike the PERCH study of severe pneumonia with hospital admission, the Drakenstein substudy found that cytomegalovirus, bocavirus, and adenovirus were associated with case status.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p><p id="para660">Our study has several limitations, particularly related to viral pathogens as confounders of pneumonia aetiology, to the copathogen interpretation, and to bacterial aetiology. Our descriptive analysis underscored limitations inherent to nearly every pneumonia aetiology study&#x02014;multiple specimens, multiple tests with varying sensitivity and specificity, and the absence of an established and principled method to integrate the results in a single aetiology analysis&#x02014;and justifies the novel analytical approach we have taken. As in all case-control studies, residual confounding cannot be excluded. Despite matching controls by community of residence, age, and season of cases, there are likely to be factors that influence nasopharyngeal infection and independently influence infection with significant lung pathogens (eg, crowding); this could overestimate the role of viruses and underestimate the role of bacteria. The PIA model integrates the multiple observed laboratory results, acknowledging the inherent error in laboratory measurements, the reduced sensitivity of assays because of previous antibiotic use or low blood culture volume, and the indirect nature of data obtained from sampling body fluids distant from the lung. The model assumes each case has a primary pathogen as the cause and does not attempt to estimate whether specific pathogen combinations are necessary for pneumonia. This approach has been described in detail elsewhere<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and has been contrasted with the standard attributable fraction method. The PIA model includes assumptions on the sensitivity of laboratory measures and aetiology priors, each with a range provided. The validity of the assumptions regarding sensitivity is limited by the availability of data on diagnostic test performance. Despite the potential misspecification of these assumptions, sensitivity analyses showed that the aetiology results were robust to changes in these values, except the aetiology prior for NOS.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Furthermore, the inherent ability of an observational study to accurately define the contribution of bacteria to pneumonia is uncertain. To advance this problem will require better diagnostics (such as discriminating PCR in blood samples or other pathogen-specific, infection-specific biomarkers), specimens other than the NP-OP swabs (such as lung aspirates, which are very challenging to obtain), and the sampling of patients before they have had antibiotics, which, in the era of community case management, is increasingly unlikely. A vaccine probe study is the optimal way to reveal the contribution of a pathogen to pneumonia,<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68</sup></xref> but this can only be undertaken for one or two pathogens at a time. Finally, the all-site PERCH study pneumonia aetiological distribution reflected estimates of the distribution of cases with pneumonia who were admitted to a hospital, outside of the neonatal period, across the PERCH study sites during the period of observation. We recognise that pneumonia is an important illness in neonates. Because there was a sister study, ANISA,<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref> assessing the causes of neonatal disease during the same period, the PERCH study focused on children outside the neonatal period.</p><p id="para670">The results from the PERCH study should not be extrapolated as the global aetiological distribution of severe childhood pneumonia or interpreted as the aetiological distribution at the national level for each of the participating sites. At the time of study initiation (2011), 88% of countries eligible for programmes of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, were using Hib vaccine and 21% were using PCV in their routine immunisation programmes.<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70</sup></xref> However, the PERCH study was intentionally designed to reflect the aetiology in the setting of high PCV and Hib vaccine use. By 2020, these vaccines are expected to be used in 100% (Hib vaccine) and 93% (PCV vaccine) of Gavi-eligible countries.<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70</sup></xref> Furthermore, the aetiological distribution among the cases does not necessarily reflect the aetiological distribution among pneumonia deaths, especially in children who died in the community without the provision of curative care efforts.</p><p id="para680">The PERCH study was designed to update the evidence base on causes of serious pneumonia with use of the most advanced clinical, microbiological, and analytical methods, deployed across geographically and epidemiologically diverse study sites in Africa and south Asia, where the pneumonia burden is greatest. Beyond comparing the clinical and microbiological findings of cases and controls, as has traditionally been done in aetiology studies, we have used a novel analytical method to overcome some of the limitations of this traditional approach and estimate the aetiology distribution, with 95% CrI, in both the population and each individual. Previously, infectious aetiology studies were unable to integrate the results from multiple specimen types for multiple pathogens.</p><p id="para690">Our results highlight the consistency of the pneumonia aetiology findings across sites, disease severity, and age strata, providing evidence to target the handful of pathogens that are consistently identified as important for prevention and treatment. RSV is the most common cause of serious pneumonia with hospital admission in these settings and should be a target for dedicated prevention and treatment efforts. Bacterial pathogens cumulatively cause a substantial proportion of disease and, because they are treatable and commonly fatal, should remain as targets for early access to appropriate supportive and curative treatment. The PERCH study estimated that 61% of pneumonia requiring hospital admission in children younger than 5 years and without HIV infection had a primary viral cause; however, we cannot firmly exclude the presence of bacterial co-infection, as discussed above. Nevertheless, this finding strengthens the need to adjust pneumonia treatment algorithms to emphasise supportive care and identify children for whom antibiotics are unlikely to be therapeutic, thereby reducing the pressure for antimicrobial resistance. Future pneumonia research needs to address the conundrum of multiple pathogens and the sequence of their role in pneumonia pathogenesis. The findings from the PERCH study should prompt additional investments in pneumonia prevention, testing, triage, and treatment and should encourage the use of innovative design and analyses in aetiology studies, especially those that can further assess pneumonia as a multipathogen disease.</p><p id="para700"><boxed-text id="cetextbox20"><p id="para710">Correspondence to: Dr Katherine L O'Brien, Department of International Health, International Vaccine Access Center, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="mailto:obrienk@who.int" id="interrefs40">obrienk@who.int</ext-link></p></boxed-text></p><p id="para320a"><boxed-text id="cetextbox30"><p id="para330b"><bold>This online publication has been corrected.

Foundation to the International Vaccine Access Center, Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (Baltimore, MD, USA). JAGS was supported by a clinical fellowship from the Wellcome Trust (UK; 098532). We gratefully acknowledge the substantial contributions to the design of the study by the Pneumonia Methods Working Group (Zulfiqar A Bhutta, Robert E Black, Harry Campbell, Thomas Cherian, Derrick Crook, Menno D de Jong, Scott F Dowell, Stephen M Graham, Keith P Klugman, Claudio F Lanata, Shabir A Madhi, Paul Martin, James Nataro, Franco Piazza, Shamim Ahmed Qazi, Heather Zar) and the PERCH Site Selection Committee (David L Blazes, Robert Bollinger, Claire V Broome, John A Crump, Olivier Fontaine, Robert Gie, David Goldblatt, Patrick W Kelley, Sharon J Peacock, Mark S Riddle, Montse Soriano-Gabarr&#x000f3;, Annelies Van Rie, Christopher W Woods). The PERCH Expert Group (William C Blackwelder, Harry Campbell, John A Crump, Menno D de Jong, Adegoke Falade, Claudio F Lanata, Kim Mulholland, Shamim Ahmed Qazi, Cynthia G Whitney) provided valuable advice during the conduct of the study and the analysis of the results for which we are indebted. We also recognise the support provided by the Institutional Review Boards for study oversight. We appreciate the helpful discussions with our many colleagues who were conducting aetiology studies of pneumonia, neonatal sepsis, and diarrhoea during the same period, including the EPIC study, the GABRIEL study, the ANISA study, and the GEMS study. We acknowledge the work of all PERCH contributors who were involved in data collection at the local sites and central laboratories, members of the PERCH Chest Radiograph Reading Panel (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref> for the list of members in each group), and Shalika Jayawardena and Rose Watt from Canterbury Health Laboratories. Finally, we gratefully recognise the willingness and confidence in the study by the parents of the participating children and express our gratitude for their commitment to the advancement of knowledge toward better health for children of their community and those of other communities.
