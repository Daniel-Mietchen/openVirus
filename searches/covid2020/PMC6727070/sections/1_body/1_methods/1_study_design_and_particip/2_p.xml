 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Exclusion criteria for cases and controls were hospitalisation within the preceding 14 days, having been discharged as a PERCH case within the preceding 30 days, and residence outside the study catchment area. Cases had the additional exclusion criterion of resolution of lower chest wall indrawing after bronchodilator therapy for children with wheeze. At all sites, case assessment occurred within 24 h of admission. In Bangladesh, children from the Dhaka site that met the case definition were identified at an outpatient clinic and referred for hospital admission; children whose parents refused hospital admission were still enrolled if they met all other inclusion criteria (n=33). Each site enrolled participants over a 24-month period (

At the remaining sites, screening was done during established hours; all eligible consenting cases presenting during predefined screening hours were enrolled, except for Mali, where a systematic sampling process was used (
