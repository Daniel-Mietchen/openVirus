<p id="para130">Controls were randomly selected from residents of the same catchment area as cases and frequency matched to cases by age group (1 to &lt;6 months, 6 to &lt;12 months, 12 to &lt;24 months, and 24â€“59 months of age), as previously described.

 </xref> Sites aimed to enrol a minimum of 25 controls monthly or matched to case counts when they had enrolled more than 25 cases in a month. Controls were enrolled regardless of respiratory symptoms to provide the least biased comparison for estimating pneumonia causes, but were ineligible if they met the PERCH case definition.
