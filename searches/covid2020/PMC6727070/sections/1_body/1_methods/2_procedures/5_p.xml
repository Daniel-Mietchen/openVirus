<p id="para200">We obtained a single induced sputum or gastric aspirate specimen from each case, except in South Africa, where two specimens were routinely collected for increased tuberculosis detection, or at physicians' discretion for cases with suspected tuberculosis diagnosis. The first specimen alone was used to define a positive result for 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> to ensure cross-site comparability; the lower sensitivity of a single specimen was accounted for in the aetiology analysis. With the exception of tuberculosis, we did not use the induced sputum results in the aetiology analysis because the microbiological findings from sputum culture and PCR did not add information beyond that added by the NP-OP specimens, which had the analytical advantage of availability from both cases and controls.
