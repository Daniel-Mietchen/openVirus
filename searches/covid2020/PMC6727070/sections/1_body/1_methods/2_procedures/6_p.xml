<p id="para210">Pneumococcal serotypes were assessed by Quellung reaction or PCR; for NP-OP specimens that were culture negative but PCR positive and met the density threshold criteria for positivity and adequate specimen volume, we used a microarray assay to assess serotype (n=52;

The Gambia, Mali, South Africa, and Zambia (for part of the study period) used PCV13, whereas Kenya used the ten-valent PCV (PCV10). The multiplex PCR panel included a target for all
