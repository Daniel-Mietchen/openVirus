 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Briefly, we used a 33-pathogen multiplex quantitative PCR (FTD Resp-33, Fast Track Diagnostics, Sliema, Malta) and cultures to test NP-OP swabs (of cases and controls; cultures were done for 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> alone), induced sputum (of cases), lung aspirates (of eligible cases in The Gambia, Bangladesh, Mali, and South Africa), and pleural fluid (at the discretion of the treating paediatrician in cases with pleural effusions on chest x-ray); gastric aspirates from cases were cultured for mycobacteria alone. We tested blood samples for 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> by PCR for cases and controls and with cultures for cases only. Pleural fluid specimens that signalled positive by automated culture but yielded no pathogen on subculture were also tested for pneumococcal antigen (BinaxNOW, Alere, Orlando, FL, USA; 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). We tested serum specimens from cases and controls for the presence of antimicrobial activity; specimens from cases were also tested for C-reactive protein.
