<p id="para270">The PIA model assumes that a pneumonia event is caused by a single pathogen. For cases with multiple pathogens detected in silver standard measurements (eg, blood cultures, lung aspirates, or pleural fluid), the model cannot distinguish which one is the dominant cause. For these cases, the model distributes the aetiology probability equally across the pathogens detected. This distribution leads to an underestimation of the contribution of the true cause of the disease because the sum of the pathogen probabilities for an individual case in this primary pathogen model must be 100%. For cases who are negative by silver standard measurements, the cause is distributed across multiple pathogens according to the strength of evidence for each pathogen. This evidence includes whether the pathogen was detected in multiple samples from the individual, the pathogen's prevalence among cases, the pathogen's odds ratio, and a-priori assumptions regarding sensitivity and aetiology.</p>
