<p id="para240">Unless otherwise specified, we restricted analyses to cases and controls without HIV infection because the aetiological distribution was expected to vary substantially according to HIV infection status (to be reported in a separate publication). The primary analysis was to estimate the aetiological fraction of severe and very severe pneumonia among cases with a positive chest x-ray; cases were restricted to positive results in chest x-rays because the analytical method for assessing causes, the PERCH Integrated Analysis (PIA) model, assumed that all cases had a lung infection. A secondary analysis of all cases without HIV infection, regardless of chest x-ray, was done and is reported in the

 </xref> Children missing all laboratory measurements used in the integrated aetiology analysis (blood cultures, NP-OP PCR, whole blood PCR, and tuberculosis cultures for cases; NP-OP PCR and whole blood PCR for controls) were excluded from the analyses. For children with at least one of these measurements, any missing data for the other measurements were imputed during model estimation by use of standard Bayesian methods.
