<p id="para300">The PIA model was applied on data from all sites combined and assumed that the measurement sensitivities were common across sites, while allowing the aetiological distributions and control prevalences to vary across sites (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). We did analyses stratified by age (&lt;1 year and â‰¥1 year) and WHO pneumonia severity (severe and very severe). The all-site results were based on cases with a positive chest x-ray, wherein each case, without regard to site, contributed equally to the estimated aetiology distribution, and based on all controls. To assess differences in the aetiological distribution related to site, we standardised the age and severity of case distributions at each site to that of all sites combined (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). We compared the age and severity-standardised results across sites for ten focus pathogens (
 <italic>H influenzae, M tuberculosis, S aureus, S pneumoniae</italic>, human metapneumovirus [HMPV], influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], and 
 <italic>P jirovecii</italic>). We defined focus pathogens on the basis of results of the all-site aetiological analysis. Focus pathogens were those with aetiology estimates higher than 5% (n=7) or higher than 2% that were of epidemiological interest (defined as treatable by antibiotics [
 <italic>P jirovecii</italic> and 
 <italic>S aureus</italic>] or having an available vaccine [influenza virus]). The 95% CrI around the aetiological fraction of these three pathogens overlap with some non-focus pathogens; therefore, we used the term focus pathogen rather than labelling these ten as the most common pathogens. In this study, we also report the list of the site-specific ten most common pathogens and the overall aetiological fraction of those pathogens (ie, the ten pathogens with the highest aetiological fraction at a given site).
