<p id="para250">Statistical comparisons of demographic and clinical characteristics between sites and case-control groups were done with logistic regression that adjusted for age in months, with or without site as appropriate. We compared the prevalence of organisms measured in both cases and controls using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs calculated by logistic regression, adjusting for site, age in months, and the other pathogens detected (this adjustment for NP-OP PCR results alone); we could not adjust for previous antibiotic use because it was rare among controls. Except for selected site-stratified analyses, results are for all sites combined; comprehensive site-specific results will be published separately. We used elevated C-reactive protein concentrations in the case descriptive analysis, but this was not a variable in the PIA model.</p>
