<p id="para500">RSV was the dominant pathogen in all sites, accounting for 31Â·1% of the aetiology distribution, more than three times greater than the next leading pathogen. RSV was notable not only for its frequent detection in the NP-OP of cases with a positive chest x-ray, but also for its uncommon detection in controls, making it one of a few pathogens (including parainfluenza 1 and HMPV) for which detection had high predictive value for aetiological attribution. RSV was a common pathogen across age strata and pneumonia severities, although the aetiological fraction was notably higher in infants than in older children. The predominance of RSV emphasises its importance as a prevention and therapeutic target. In the past decade, pneumonia aetiology studies
