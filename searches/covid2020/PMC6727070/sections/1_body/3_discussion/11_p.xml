<p id="para580">The aetiological contribution of non-tested pathogens (ie, the NOS category) was approximately 2% in the all-site analysis. Sensitivity analyses that assumed a higher fraction for the NOS category (aetiology prior set at 25% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 3%) concluded that the NOS category would probably not account for more than 15% of cases across the sites, except in Thailand (25%). This emphasises that strong evidence exists for the aetiological contribution of pathogens tested for in our study, unless there is substantial confounding of the true cause by these pathogens. Because the value chosen for the aetiology prior influences the fraction attributed to the NOS category, our analysis cannot be used to estimate precisely the size of the NOS category. However, it does affirm that NOS accounts for a small fraction of pneumonia causes.
