<p id="para510">The contribution of parainfluenza viruses and HMPV to the aetiological distribution varied little by age strata or disease severity but did vary by site. We recorded a low prevalence (&lt;5%) of influenza A or B in all sites and the aetiological contribution of influenza A or B did not exceed 3% in any site except Zambia (6Â·1%). Influenza circulation varies annually, and the 2 years of enrolment in the PERCH study might have been low circulation years.</p>
