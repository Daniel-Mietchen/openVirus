<p id="para640">Among the ten focus pathogens of our study, a subset (HMPV, parainfluenza, 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>, human rhinovirus, 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic>, and 
 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic>) differed in their importance across sites. The estimated contributions of some pathogens varied by age strata (RSV, pertussis, parainfluenza types 1 and 3, 
 <italic>P jirovecii, S aureus, S pneumoniae</italic>, parechovirus-enterovirus, and rhinovirus) and by disease severity (all viral causes combined, RSV, 
 <italic>S aureus, S pneumoniae</italic>, and parainfluenza type 3), which might have implications for treatment guideline revisions. Because preventive measures against current pathogens are increasingly implemented, the proportional aetiological distribution will continue to change over time.
