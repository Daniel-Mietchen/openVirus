<p id="para600">Four sites (The Gambia, South Africa, Mali, and Bangladesh) included lung aspirate specimen collection as part of the study protocol. Because of the clinical criteria for specimen collection (ie, cases with anterior, large, and right-sided consolidation), hesitation from clinicians and families, and delays in ethical approvals and training at some sites, only 37 (6Â·8%) of 545 cases with radiographic consolidation enrolled at these four sites had a lung aspirate specimen collected. Pathogen detection from lung aspirates was lower (29% overall, 41% when both culture and PCR were undertaken) than that reported in previous studies, possibly because the timing of lung aspirates occurred after antibiotic administration.

 </xref> Pleural fluid specimens, included in the study protocol in all sites at the discretion of the treating clinicians, were only available from 15 (8%) of 180 cases in whom at least one standardised chest x-ray reader identified pleural fluid; however, a pathogen was detected in 80% of these specimens. Bacteria were more commonly detected on these specimens than viruses, with the most common being

 <italic>S aureus</italic> in pleural fluid. These specimens, although most directly reflective of the true cause of pneumonia, were collected in a highly selected group of cases and the results are unlikely to be generalisable.
