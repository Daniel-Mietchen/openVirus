<p id="para620">We did not obtain chest x-rays from a small proportion of cases (6%, n=234), many (33%) because of death soon after enrolment, limiting the representation of microbiological findings in immediately fatal cases in the primary analysis. Among cases with a chest x-ray, 53% had either a normal or uninterpretable finding; by design, the WHO clinical pneumonia case definitions are highly sensitive, but non-specific. We focused on the epidemiological and laboratory characteristics of cases with pneumonia with a positive x-ray to enhance the specificity of the clinical case definition for pneumonia, recognising that this might introduce bias by excluding cases with pneumonia whose x-ray findings lagged behind the clinical findings or cases with lower tract disease caused by pathogens who did not have chest x-ray infiltrates (eg, pertussis). We assessed this bias by providing analyses of all cases, regardless of x-ray findings, and observed little difference in the findings. Notably, among cases without a positive chest x-ray, 26% either had a missing or uninterpretable x-ray.</p>
