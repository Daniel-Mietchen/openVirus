<p id="para610">Clinical characteristics and case outcomes varied substantially by site. The high variation in wheezing prevalence among cases, especially the extremely high prevalence in Bangladesh, might be related to poor air quality, infection, or underlying propensity for bronchospasm in the children presenting for care.

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Sites also differed in the mix of case severity, which might reflect underlying host factors (eg, nutritional status), other concurrent illnesses (eg, malaria), or patient propensity for seeking care and ability to access to care. Because pathogen findings differed by case severity, it is possible that the stratification of cases on finer or differently defined severity indicators might control for some confounding by site. Case-fatality ratios varied by site, reflecting differences in case severity and clinical care. Among all cases who died in the 30 days after hospital admission, only a small proportion of deaths (41 [14%] of 292) occurred after discharge. This is similar to the proportion of mortality (16% of deaths) observed to occur after discharge in a study of severe pneumonia requiring hospital admission in children younger than 5 years in Kilifi,
