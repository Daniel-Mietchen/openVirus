<p id="para670">The results from the PERCH study should not be extrapolated as the global aetiological distribution of severe childhood pneumonia or interpreted as the aetiological distribution at the national level for each of the participating sites. At the time of study initiation (2011), 88% of countries eligible for programmes of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, were using Hib vaccine and 21% were using PCV in their routine immunisation programmes.
