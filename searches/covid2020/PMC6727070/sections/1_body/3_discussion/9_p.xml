<p id="para560">Among other vaccine-preventable pathogens, 
 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> burden varied by site, accounting for 6â€“10% of the aetiology in four sites (The Gambia, Zambia, South Africa, and Thailand), but less than 3% elsewhere. 
 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> was rarely cultured from induced sputum or gastric aspirates and, in the South Africa site, testing more than one specimen increased the yield.

 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> culture is low when testing a single induced sputum specimen (30%) and remains low even when multiple samples were taken from children with pulmonary tuberculosis;

 </xref> this was accounted for in the aetiology model. Perhaps owing to high vaccination rates, 
 <italic>B pertussis</italic> was rarely identified but, when present, was most often found in children younger than 12 months. Detection of 
 <italic>B pertussis</italic> by PCR of NP-OP specimens was highly predictive of case status, with very few positives identified in controls.

 </xref> We saw few cases that were clinically compatible with measles, therefore it is unlikely that we missed many measles-related cases of pneumonia, highlighting the efforts of measles control at the sites during the study. Hib was an uncommon cause for pneumonia in our study and was less common than non-type b 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic>. The longstanding use of Hib vaccine in several study sites could have accounted for the low contribution of Hib to the aetiological distribution. However, the two sites where the contribution of Hib exceeded the contribution of non-b 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> (Mali and Zambia) did not have the lowest Hib vaccination rates. Thailand was the only site not using Hib vaccine; the reason for the small contribution of Hib to pneumonia aetiology in Thailand is unclear, but might relate to access to outpatient antibiotics.
