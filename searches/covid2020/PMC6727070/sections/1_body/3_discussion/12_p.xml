<p id="para590">The contribution of NP-OP data for assessing aetiological probability depends on differences in frequency of detection between cases and controls. The validity of NP-OP infection as a source of aetiological inference for a selected group of pneumonia pathogens is supported by the finding that clear distinctions in prevalence by case or control status were found consistently across sites. However, NP-OP specimens provide little inferential value to the cause of pneumonia at the individual case level, except for a small group of pathogens, such as RSV and

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> For those pathogens with NP-OP OR lower than 1, ruling out their role in the causal chain was not possible with this study design; probe or longitudinal study designs are needed to better understand the contribution of these pathogens to pneumonia aetiology and better explore the sequence from NP-OP infection to lung infection. Despite their limitations, NP-OP specimens remain of substantial importance for pneumonia aetiology studies because they are easily collected, can be subjected to molecular diagnostic testing, and can provide valid information about infection of certain pathogens in the respiratory tract.
