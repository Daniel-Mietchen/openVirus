<p id="para630">We did the PERCH study over a 24-month period at each site to obtain more reliable data on annual seasonality patterns and to increase the probability of detecting pathogens that exhibit multi-year epidemic cycles. We were unlikely to miss seasonal outbreaks; however, some pathogens (eg, 
 <italic>B pertussis</italic>, influenza subtypes, parainfluenza viruses, and 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>) have periodicities that are longer than 24 months and, therefore, we might have observed quiescent periods.
