<p id="para520">Of the tested pathogens, human rhinovirus was associated with the most geographical heterogeneity in aetiological fraction, ranging from 30% in Bangladesh and 13% in Kenya, to less than 2% in Zambia, The Gambia, and Mali. Human rhinovirus predominance in Kenya was not explained by an overrepresentation of respiratory infection seasons (three compared with two seasons in all other African sites; 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>), on the basis of an analysis of the Kenya data that excluded the third respiratory season (data not shown). Although well described as a cause of upper respiratory tract infection, the role of human rhinovirus as a cause of pneumonia is uncertain.

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> It is possible that human rhinovirus, as several other respiratory viruses, might be incorrectly attributed as the true cause of pneumonia despite all methodological and analytical efforts to address this. This general limitation extends beyond this study to most case-control studies for pneumonia aetiology, leading to an exaggeration of the contribution of viruses to pneumonia when the primary specimen used to assess causality is from the upper respiratory tract. However, the OR and the significant association with wheeze (data not shown) argues against this.
