<p id="para480">The principal finding of the PERCH study was that, in low-income and low-middle-income settings with widespread uptake of Hib vaccine and PCV, viruses, especially RSV, were the predominant cause of pneumonia requiring hospital admission in children younger than 5 years at all sites, but bacteria continued to cause from a quarter to a third of all cases. In each site, a small number of pathogens accounted for most cases admitted to hospital with radiographically confirmed pneumonia; the ten most common pathogens at a given site accounted for 79% or more of cases of disease at that site. Furthermore, most cases at every site were caused by a handful of pathogens that were commonly found in all sites. Nonetheless, the relative contribution of these pathogens varied by age and, to a lesser degree, by severity of the disease.</p>
