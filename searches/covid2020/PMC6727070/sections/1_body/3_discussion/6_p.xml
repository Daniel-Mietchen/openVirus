<p id="para530">For bacteria that commonly colonise the upper respiratory tract, such as 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic>, the inferential role of NP-OP PCR for estimating aetiology in a case-control study has inherent uncertainties. To mitigate the risk of underestimating the attributable aetiology of these bacterial pathogens, analyses incorporated pathogen density measures from the NP-OP specimens to distinguish cases from controls, adjustment for antibiotic exposure that lowers detection in the NP-OP PCR, and blood PCR for 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>. Additionally, for these and all bacterial pathogens, we directly sampled from the lung (albeit in few cases), optimised and adjusted for the volume of blood for culture, accounted for the effect of previous antibiotic exposure on the sensitivity of bacterial pathogen detection for blood cultures, and accounted for the low sensitivity of blood cultures.
