<p id="para540">About 3% of cases in the PERCH study had a non-contaminant organisms isolated from blood culture. 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> was the most common isolate, consistent with other childhood pneumonia aetiology studies.

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Although we attempted to improve identification of cases with true pneumococcal pneumonia using whole blood PCR,
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> the specificity was poor because prevalence was similar between cases and controls (aOR 1·2); this improved somewhat when bacterial load was considered (aOR 1·6). Perhaps the poor specificity of blood PCR is due to low level seeding, swallowed sputum, or gastrointestinal tract absorption of pneumococcal antigens from common colonisation with 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> in the nasopharynx.

 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> was lower in Asian sites

  <sup>26</sup>
 </xref> and in the Zambia site, which had the highest prevalence of antibiotic pretreatment. Neither the Asian sites nor the South Africa site had a positive blood culture for 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>, unlike the other four African sites. We investigated the site performance of blood collection and culture and found no methodological explanation for the inability to isolate 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> from blood cultures at these three sites, nor for the lower prevalence of positive pneumococcal results in the Asian sites compared with that of other sites. However, the South Africa site had two blood culture samples that were alarm positive, culture negative, with pneumococci in chains detected on Gram stain, and Binax positive, and all three sites isolated pneumococci from blood in patients who were not enrolled in the PERCH study during the same period. Antibiotic treatment before specimen collection is known to influence the isolation of bacteria from blood and NP, as we have previously described,
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> but does not substantially influence pneumococcal detection by whole blood PCR.
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The prevalence of antibiotic pretreatment was particularly high in Zambia (92%), South Africa (57%), and Kenya (35%); this was accounted for, as described previously, by reducing the sensitivity.
