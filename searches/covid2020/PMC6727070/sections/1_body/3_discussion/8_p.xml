<p id="para550">There were reasons to expect that, in our study, there would be a lower burden of pneumococcal disease than in earlier studies. By design, sites with PCV in routine use were targeted for participation in the PERCH study (all except Zambia, Thailand, and Bangladesh used PCV), which could have reduced the pneumococcal pneumonia disease burden by approximately 70% at those sites, if the serotype distribution matched that of invasive pneumococcal disease.

Furthermore, 60% of cases in the PERCH study were younger than 1 year, with many younger than 6 months, a group often excluded from the analyses of clinical trials of pneumococcal vaccine that partly formed the basis for our expectations about pneumococcal burden. Economic development and improved access to care might also have reduced hospital admissions for pneumococcal pneumonia through effective early outpatient treatment. In some sites, such as Thailand, the absence of any detected cases of pneumococcal bacteraemia might simply reflect low enrolment numbers, given that invasive pneumococcal disease has been observed at this site in other studies.
