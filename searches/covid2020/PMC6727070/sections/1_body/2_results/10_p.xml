<p id="para420">Integrating the microbiology results from the multiple specimens among the 1767 cases with a positive chest x-ray and the 5075 controls, we estimated that more disease was due to viral pathogens (61·4%, 95% CrI 57·3–65·6) than to bacterial pathogens (other than 
 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic>; 27·3%, 23·3–31·6); the remaining aetiological fractions were attributed to 
 <italic>M tuberculosis, Candida</italic> spp, 
 <italic>P jirovecii</italic>, and causes not otherwise specified (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). RSV was the most common cause (31·1%, 95% CrI 28·4–34·2), and other common pathogens (each accounting for 5% or more of the aetiological distribution) included human rhinovirus, HMPV A or B, human parainfluenza virus (types 1–4 combined), 
 <italic>S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis</italic>, and 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic>. Unknown causes (NOS category) accounted for 1·8% (95% CrI 0·2–4·5) of the pneumonia aetiology distribution. The fraction of pneumonia attributable to pathogens targeted by currently licensed vaccines (Hib, vaccine-serotype 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>, pertussis, 
 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic>, and influenza A or B) was 14·0% (11·3–17·0).
