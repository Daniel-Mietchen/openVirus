<p id="para470">Sensitivity analyses were done to assess the effect of the assumptions of PIA model sensitivity and aetiology priors on the aetiology findings. Lowering and narrowing the pneumococcal blood culture sensitivity prior, or increasing its aetiology prior, had little effect on the 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> aetiology estimate, probably because of the strength of evidence regarding 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> from the other measurements (NP-OP PCR and whole blood PCR;
