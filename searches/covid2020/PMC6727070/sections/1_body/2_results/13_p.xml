<p id="para450">The site-specific aetiology results standardised for age and severity of the ten focus pathogens showed consistency across the sites for most pathogens (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>), including for influenza, which did not exceed 3% in any site except Zambia (6·1%). Exceptions to this consistency included the following: rhinovirus was substantially more common in Bangladesh (29·7%) and Kenya (12·9%); 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> was extremely uncommon in Bangladesh (0·7%); 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> type b in Zambia (3·4%) and Mali (4·2%) and non-type b 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> in South Africa (10·0%) were disproportionately higher than in other sites; and 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>, both vaccine-types and non-vaccine-types, was higher in The Gambia (15·1%) and Mali (17·4%) than in other sites. The fraction of cases attributed to bacteria was lower in Bangladesh (10·4%) and Kenya (17·5%) than in other sites (range 32·7–37·6). 
 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> had a larger aetiological fraction in Zambia, The Gambia, Thailand, and South Africa (6·4–10·2) than in other sites (&lt;3%). The NOS contribution was 2% or less in all sites except Thailand (7·4%). The results standardised for age and severity (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>) did not differ from the primary, non-standardised, site-specific results (ie, based on the mix of cases enrolled at each site).
