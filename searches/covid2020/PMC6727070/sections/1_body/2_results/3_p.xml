It should be noted that the South African site, at an altitude of 1600 m above sea level, had a standard clinical practice to administer supplemental oxygen at admission and often before recording oxygen saturation for all children admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia. Additionally, Mali oxygen administration data were excluded from analysis because of inadequate standardisation of data recording. Tachypnoea was commonly observed at all sites (85·3% of cases).
