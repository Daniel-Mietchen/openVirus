<p id="para440">In analyses of all cases regardless of chest x-ray findings compared with cases with a positive x-ray, a greater aetiological fraction was attributed to rhinovirus (11·4% in all cases 
 <italic>vs</italic> 7·5% in cases with a positive x-ray), parechovirus–enterovirus (4·6% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 1·6%) and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria (2·8% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 0·9%) in all cases, but otherwise, the analyses did not differ substantively (
