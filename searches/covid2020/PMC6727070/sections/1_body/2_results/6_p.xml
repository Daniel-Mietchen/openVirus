 <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> was cultured from 24 (1Â·5%) of 1571 cases with positive x-rays (23 from induced sputum and one from gastric aspirate; 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). 11 (29%) of 37 lung aspirates and 12 (80%) of 15 pleural fluid specimens tested by culture, PCR, or both were positive for a pathogen; bacterial pathogens (most often 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> [lung aspirate] and 
 <italic>S aureus</italic> [pleural fluid]) were more commonly detected (in 23 cases) than viral pathogens (three cases), and all viral pathogens were co-detected with bacteria (
