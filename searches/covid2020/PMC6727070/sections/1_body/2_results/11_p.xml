<p id="para430">Some pathogens differed in their aetiological fraction by age strata. 
 <italic>B pertussis,</italic> parainfluenza type 3, 
 <italic>S aureus, P jirovecii</italic>, and RSV had a greater aetiological fraction in children younger than 1 year than in those aged 1 year or older, whereas parechovirusâ€“enterovirus, parainfluenza type 1, rhinovirus, and 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> were more common causes in children aged 1 year or older than in those younger than 1 year (
