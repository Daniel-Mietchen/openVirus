<p id="para330">Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 (73·9%) of 5723 eligible children with severe or very severe pneumonia as cases and 5119 (56·9%) of 8994 eligible children in the study catchment areas contacted as community controls; an additional 206 controls with HIV infection were enrolled from HIV clinics in South Africa and Zambia for HIV-specific analyses to be reported separately (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Enrolment of cases and controls varied by season (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Approximately 90% of the planned specimens (ranging from 88·8% for tuberculosis cultures to 98·6% for blood cultures) were collected and tested (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>); reasons for missing specimens included specimens not collected because of physician discretion or contraindication (particularly for induced sputum), specimens lost in transport, and parental refusal.

 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). The descriptive laboratory analysis and the primary aetiology analysis excluded an additional two cases and 27 controls missing all microbiology test results. The secondary all-case aetiology analysis (ie, regardless of x-ray findings) included 3968 cases and 5075 controls with at least one microbiology test result (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>); of the 3972 cases with at least one test result, four cases who tested positive for measles by NP-OP PCR (all without an infiltrate on their chest x-rays) were excluded from the all-case analysis.
