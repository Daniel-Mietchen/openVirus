<p id="para400">Almost all cases (3867 [98·9%] of 3910) and controls (4886 [98·0%] of 4984) had at least one pathogen detected (ie, ignoring density threshold) by PCR in the NP-OP specimen; most cases (2313 [59·2%]) and controls (2667 [53·5%]) had four or more pathogens detected (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). The mean number of potential pathogens detected in NP-OP specimens was 3·8 (SD 1·5) among cases and 3·6 (SD 1·5) among controls. Among cases with multiple pathogens detected in NP-OP specimens, 3219 (88·4%) of 3642 had both viral and bacterial detections; no pathogen was commonly found alone (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). In cases with a positive chest x-ray, the most common bacteria detected in NP-OP specimens were

 <italic>M catarrhalis</italic> (1153 [66·4%]), 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> (1004 [57·8%]), and 
 <italic>S aureus</italic> (268 [15·4%]), whereas cytomegalovirus (890 [51·2%]) and RSV (506 [29·1%]) were the most common viruses (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Influenza virus was rarely detected (influenza A 62 [3·6%]; influenza B 18 [1·0%]; influenza C 10 [0·6%]). 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> was more commonly detected in controls (3846 [77·2%] of 4984) than in cases with a positive chest x-ray (p=0·0001). After applying PCR density thresholds that best distinguished cases from controls,
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> the proportion of positive results in cases with a positive x-ray changed for 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> (from 72·8% to 13·5%), 
 <italic>H influenzae</italic> (from 57·8% to 29·5%), 
 <italic>P jirovecii</italic> (from 8·9% to 4·3%), and cytomegalovirus (from 51·2% to 22·7%). This changed the rank order of most commonly detected bacteria in the NP-OP specimens to 
 <italic>M catarrhalis, H influenzae, S aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Compared with controls, having a positive chest x-ray in cases was significantly associated with the presence of 15 different pathogens in NP-OP specimens (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). The adjusted ORs for NP-OP PCR results ranged widely across pathogens, with RSV (OR 14·0, 95% CI 11·4–17·1), parainfluenza 1 (7·7, 4·6–13·0), and human metapneumovirus A or B (6·3, 4·8–8·2) having the highest adjusted ORs, followed by influenza A (3·6, 2·4–5·3) and 
 <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> (3·3, 1·6–7·2); parainfluenza 1, influenza A, and 
 <italic>B pertussis</italic> were infrequently detected in cases (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). 
 <italic>M catarrhalis</italic> was the only pathogen significantly negatively associated with case status (OR 0·6, 95% CI 0·5–0·7). We observed only minor changes in the magnitude and direction of the ORs after removing the adjustment for detection of the other pathogens (
