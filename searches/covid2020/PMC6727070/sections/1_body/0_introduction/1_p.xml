 </xref> A substantial reduction in the past few decades of estimated pneumonia deaths (0·9 million in 2015 
 <italic>vs</italic> 1·7 million deaths in 1990) reflects not only economic development, improved nutrition, and reduced household crowding, but also the use of pneumonia-specific interventions such as improved case management—including empirical antibiotic treatment—and effective vaccines against leading pneumonia pathogens.
