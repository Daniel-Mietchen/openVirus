   <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para50">Before designing and doing the PERCH study, we did a detailed review to assess the body of evidence on pneumonia aetiology and the epidemiological, laboratory, and analytical methods used to quantify causes of pneumonia in young children. Additionally, we established an expert panel, the Pneumonia Methods Working Group (PMWG), to provide additional advice on the key epidemiological, laboratory, study design, and analytical issues that the PERCH study needed to optimise. The search dates, databases used, search terms, and restrictions are detailed in a separate publication (Zunera Gilani and colleagues, 2012). The results of our reviews of the pre-existing evidence and the decisions reached by the PMWG have been published in a set of methods papers and in the protocol. Since this review, the descriptive results of three large paediatric pneumonia aetiology studies in children younger than 5 years have been published—from the USA (EPIC), South Africa (Drakenstein), and a multicountry study (GABRIEL)—and were considered in our analysis.</p>

   <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para70">The PERCH study is a comprehensive, systematic, multisite study of the causes of severe and very severe pneumonia with hospital admission among children aged 1–59 months in the context of routine use of 
   <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The emphasis on a single protocol with highly standardised implementation and quality control steps throughout the study conduct, the inclusion of diverse sites but with routine implementation of existing pneumonia vaccines, the duration of enrolment to capture seasonal trends, the use of a 33-target multiplex quantitative PCR, the inclusion of multiple body fluid specimens, the inclusion of an appropriate control group, the adjustment for the sensitivity of the laboratory tests, and the large size of the study all provided strength to the inferential value of the results. Our study provides results for over 30 pathogens and allows for cross-site comparisons of aetiological distribution because of its highly standardised methodology. It is the first infectious aetiology study to integrate the results of testing of multiple pathogens from multiple body fluid specimens, by using a range of laboratory assays, and to provide an aetiological distribution of the pathogens, with uncertainty intervals, both by individual and in the population. Our results showed that ten pathogens were responsible for 79–90% of cases with severe pneumonia requiring hospital admission in children younger than 5 years across a wide range of geographical and epidemiological settings. Causes of pneumonia varied by age strata and severity status and, to a lesser degree, by geography.

   <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para90">From a policy perspective, the low number of pathogens that are common causes of pneumonia requiring hospital admission in children younger than 5 years across all sites could allow for targeted development of pneumonia interventions. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common cause of disease and should be a primary target for dedicated prevention and treatment efforts, especially for children younger than 6 months. Bacterial pathogens, cumulatively, caused a substantial proportion of disease and, being treatable and commonly fatal, should remain a target for early access to treatment. Our study clearly shows that the inferential value of nasopharyngeal specimens varies by pathogen, with only a low number of pathogens providing evidence of causality. The PERCH Integrated Analysis shows the value of analytical approaches that account for pathogen prevalence, test performance, multiple specimens, and multiple results for an individual pathogen. The methods developed by the PERCH study for integrating such data, in a principled approach, offer the opportunity for other aetiology studies to also adapt and use these methods.</p>
