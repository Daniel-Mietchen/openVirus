 </xref> The PERCH study sought to provide rigorous data that would inform future prevention and treatment strategies in low-income and lower-middle-income settings and to address challenges faced by previous pneumonia aetiology studies, such as imperfect standardisation of methods and analyses, narrow generalisability, and absence of an analytical method to provide their primary output of interest, an aetiological distribution.
