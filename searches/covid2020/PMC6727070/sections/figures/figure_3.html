 <caption> Nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal (NP-OP) pathogen prevalence* and adjusted odds ratios (OR) in cases with positive chest x-ray and without HIV infection and in controls without HIV infection Pathogens are ordered alphabetically among bacteria, followed by viruses and fungi. ORs adjusted for age (months), site, and presence of other pathogens detected by NP-OP PCR, but not adjusted for previous antibiotic use, which is known to influence bacterial positivity. *Prevalence defined by use of NP-OP PCR density thresholds for four pathogens: Pneumocystis jirovecii, 4 log 10 copies per mL; Haemophilus influenzae, 5·9 log 10 copies per mL; cytomegalovirus, 4·9 log 10 copies per mL; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6·9 log 10 copies per mL; NP-OP PCR results based on positivity are in the appendix. PCV=pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. </caption>
