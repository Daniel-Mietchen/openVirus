 <caption> Case (A) and control (B) enrolment and specimen availability profile CXR=chest x-ray. NP=nasopharyngeal. OP=oropharyngeal. WB=whole blood. LA=lung aspirate. PF=pleural fluid. IS=induced sputum. GA=gastric aspirate. *Of the 88 children not enrolled because of other reasons, 45 were not enrolled because of an enrolment cap at the Mali site, ten because of political unrest in Bangladesh, and 24 in Kenya and nine in Zambia because of reasons not stated. †Included in clinical descriptive analysis. ‡Lung aspirate and pleural fluid specimens were collected on a subset of cases eligible for the procedures; for samples with low volumes, only culture was done. §Measles testing was done on a subset of cases who met the study defined clinical criteria for measles. ¶Included in laboratory descriptive analysis and aetiology analysis; at least one of the following specimens was required for a child to be included in the aetiology analysis: blood culture, NP-OP PCR, WB PCR, or tuberculosis culture for cases; and NP-OP PCR or WB PCR for controls. ||Number contacted, screened, and eligible includes some extrapolated data for the Zambia and South Africa sites; data were available for 16 of 24 months for Zambia and 10·5 of 24 months for South Africa; for each of these sites, available data were used to extrapolate numbers for the months with missing data assuming that contact, participation, and eligibility rates were constant over time.**Not shown here are an additional 206 controls with HIV infection enrolled from HIV clinics at the South Africa and Zambia sites to ensure adequate sample size of children with HIV infection; these children will be described in forthcoming manuscripts devoted to the causes of severe and very severe pneumonia in children with HIV infection. ††Data for total number of children contacted and number of children who declined or did not show to clinic were not available for the Mali site. ‡‡Among sites with available data for total number of children contacted (ie, all sites except Mali), 8149 (73·9%) of 11 033 randomly selected children or households were contacted; the number of children or guardians contacted is used as the denominator for the percentage of children screened, eligible, and enrolled; because the denominator excludes Mali but the numerator does not, the percentages for screened, eligible, and enrolled are overestimated. </caption>
