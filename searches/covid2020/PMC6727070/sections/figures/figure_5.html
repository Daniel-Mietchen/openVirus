 <caption> Site-specific aetiology results for ten focus pathogens in cases with a positive chest x-ray and without HIV infection The size of the symbol is scaled on the basis of the ratio of the estimated aetiological fraction to its SE. Of two identical aetiological fraction estimates, the estimate associated with a larger symbol is more informed by the data than the priors. Positive chest x-rays defined as consolidation or other infiltrate on the x-ray. Graph restricted to the ten focus pathogens from the all-site analysis, which include those with aetiology estimate higher than 5% (n=7) or higher than 2% that were of epidemiological interest (defined as treatable by antibiotics [ Pneumocystis jirovecii and Staphylococcus aureus] or having an available vaccine [influenza virus]). The 95% credibility intervals for the aetiological fractions of these three pathogens overlap with some non-focus pathogens, hence our use of the term focus pathogen rather than labelling these ten as the most common pathogens. Other pathogens category represents the sum of the aetiological fraction for all remaining pathogens tested for, but not presented in this figure. Site-specific results were standardised to the following case mix: 40% younger than 1 year with severe pneumonia, 20% younger than 1 year with very severe pneumonia, 30% aged 1 year or older with severe pneumonia, and 10% aged 1 year or older with very severe pneumonia. Pathogens estimated at the subspecies level, but grouped to the species level for display include parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4; Streptococcus pneumoniae PCV13 and S pneumoniae non-PCV13 types; Haemophilus influenzae type b and H influenzae non-type b; and influenza virus A, B, and C. Exact figures are given in the appendix. NOS=not otherwise specified (ie, pathogens we did not test for). *The summary for bacteria excludes Mycobacterium tuberculosis. </caption>
