  <p>Aetiological fraction unstratified (A), stratified by age (B), and stratified by severity (C) for cases with a positive chest x-ray and without HIV infection from all PERCH sites combined</p>
  <p>Lines represent 95% credible interval; the darker region of the line represents the IQR. The size of the symbol is scaled on the basis of the ratio of the estimated aetiological fraction to its SE. Of two identical aetiological fraction estimates, the estimate associated with a larger symbol is more informed by the data than the priors. Positive chest x-rays defined as consolidation or other infiltrate on the x-ray. The following pathogens contributed less than 1% to the aetiological fraction (overall and after stratifying by age and severity) and were excluded from the figure: Coronavirus, 
   <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic>, and 
   <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>. Other streptococci and enterococci includes 
   <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and 
   <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>. Non-fermentative Gram-negative rods (NFGNR) includes 
   <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp and 
   <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. Enterobacteriaceae includes 
   <italic>Escherichia coli, Enterobacter</italic> spp, and 
   <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp, excluding mixed Gram-negative rods. Pathogens that were estimated at the subspecies level, but grouped to the species level for display include parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3 and 4; 
   <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> PCV 13 and 
   <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> non-PCV 13 types; 
   <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b and 
   <italic>H influenzae</italic> non-type b; and influenza A, B, and C. Exact figures, including subspecies and serotype disaggregation (eg, PCV13 type and non-PCV13 type), are given in the 
   <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>. NOS=not otherwise specified (ie, pathogens we did not test for).
