  <p>Blood culture results by study site in cases with positive chest x-ray and without HIV infection</p>
  <p>Enterobacteriaceae includes 
   <italic>Escherichia coli, Enterobacter</italic> spp, and 
   <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp, excluding mixed Gram-negative rods. Other streptopcocci and enterococci include 
   <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and 
   <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>. Mixed label includes 
   <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp and other streptopcocci and enterococci. Contaminants, including those organisms deemed to be contaminants after clinical review, were excluded from the analysis. Figure is restricted to cases with available blood culture results. The numbers on the top of the bars refer to the total number of positive blood cultures. Two of the cases positive for pneumococcus in Kenya were pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) 13-type but not PCV10-type (serotypes 19A and 6A). Antibiotic pretreatment (defined as having a positive serum bioassay result, antibiotics administered at the referral facility, or antibiotic administration before whole-blood specimen collection at the study facility) varied by site: The Gambia (composite 10·6%, bioassay 7·6%), Mali (22·4%, 17·1%), Kenya (35·1%, 10·0%), Zambia (92·2%, 25·3%), South Africa (57·2%, 54·2%), Bangladesh (24·6%, 21·6%), and Thailand (30·6%, 19·4%).
