 <caption> Cumulative contribution of site-specific ten most common pathogens in cases with a positive chest x-ray and without HIV infection Positive chest x-rays defined as consolidation or other infiltrate on the x-ray. Site-specific results were standardised to the following case mix: 40% younger than 1 year with severe pneumonia, 20% younger than 1 year with very severe pneumonia, 30% aged 1 year or older with severe pneumonia, and 10% aged 1 year or older with very severe pneumonia. Ranks correspond to the site-specific rank from the top ten pathogens of each site; the pathogen corresponding to each rank varies by site (see inset panel). Other strep category includes Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecium. Non-fermentative Gram-negative rods (NFGNR) includes Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas spp. Enterobacteriaceae category (Entrb) includes Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae spp, and Klebsiella spp, excluding mixed Gram-negative rods. Pathogens estimated at the subspecies level, but grouped to the species level for display include parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4; Streptococcus pneumoniae PCV13 and S pneumoniae non-PCV13 types; Haemophilus influenzae type b and H influenzae non-type b; and influenza virus A, B, and C. Boca=human bocavirus. Cand sp= Candida spp. CMV=cytomegalovirus. Flu=influenza virus A, B and C. H inf= H influenzae. HMPV=human metapneumovirus A or B. Mtb= Mycobacterium tuberculosis. M cat= Moraxella catarrhalis. NOS=not otherwise specified (ie, pathogens we did not test for). P jirov= Pneumocystis jirovecii. Para=parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3 and 4. PV-EV=parechovirusâ€“enterovirus. Rhino=human rhinovirus. RSV=respiratory syncytial virus A or B. S aur= Staphylococcus aureus. S pneu= S pneumoniae. Salm sp= Salmonella spp. </caption>
