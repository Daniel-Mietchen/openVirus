  <title>Therapeutic agents that could be used to block 2019-nCoV from infecting cells.</title>
  <p>Target cells expressing ACE2 include lung and gastrointestinal tissues in the human body. The large spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus binds to ACE2 on infected cells, leading to cell entry. Three proposed strategies would block this interaction would abrogate infection. In the first, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein from SARS or 2019-nCoV would be administered, thereby binding ACE2 and saturating available sites. Alternatively, an antibody or single chain antibody fragment (scFv) could be administered against ACE2 to accomplish the same. A third strategy would target the coronavirus virions directly by using the ACE2 extracellular domain as bait to bind to spike protein. An Fc domain fused to ACE2 would facilitate prolonged circulation of the biologic (ACE2-Fc).</p>
