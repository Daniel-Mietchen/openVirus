  <p>In the updatedÂ version of the manuscript, the use of recombinant ACE2 is highlighted as a treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including several studies exploring its use to treat ARDS during RSV and H5N1 infection. Importantly, two clinical trials employing recombinant ACE2 are described, which provides important data for the safety of translating the ACE2-Fc approach into human patients in an expedited manner. Given the potential for ACE2-Fc to have this third mechanism of action, the focus was shifted toward using the wild type ACE2 sequence rather than abolishing peptidase activity. Overall, this additional evidence increases the potential for ACE2-Fc to have a positive therapeutic benefit in patients infected with 2019-nCoV.</p>
