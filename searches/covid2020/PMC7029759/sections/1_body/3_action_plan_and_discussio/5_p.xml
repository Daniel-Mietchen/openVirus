<p>A final benefit of pursuing ACE2-Fc is that it could effectively be used as a therapeutic drug stockpile for future outbreaks of SARS and 2019-nCoV, and any new coronavirus that emerges from a zoonotic reservoir in the future that uses the ACE2 receptor for entry. Moreover, coronaviruses that replicate in animals across China and other countries could be studied in order to assess their entry mechanisms. By understanding entry in these other animals, one could effectively predict a receptor that could be utilized in any zoonotic transmission event, and build a new receptor immunoadhesin molecule in the future. As an example, a similar immunoadhesin, DPP4-Fc, could be envisioned for MERS based on the viral receptor, DPP4, used by that virus
