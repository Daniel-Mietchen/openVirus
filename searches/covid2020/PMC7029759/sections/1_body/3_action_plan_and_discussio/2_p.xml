<p>The goal would be that ACE2-Fc could treat infection in current patients preventing significant morbidities and death, while also serving as a potential prophylactic to give passive immunity to clinical providers on the frontlines, as well as individuals who may have been exposed to the virus. Essentially, ACE2-Fc could be the potent neutralizing antibody that the global health community needs to combat 2019-nCoV, today, while also treating the underlying ARDS pathophysiology causing patient mortality. It could be scaled much more quickly than convalescent patient sera, which would be dependent on infected individuals to make. ACE2-Fc would be resistant to viral escape as well, unlike potential neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that may be developed in the coming weeks to months.</p>
