<p>The chief objective of global health efforts against 2019-nCoV remains to effectively quarantine patients and screen individuals who may be infected to limit spread. That objective should continue going forward. What is proposed here is an option to at least give infected patients a medication quickly to help alleviate symptoms and prevent death, while vaccine efforts for 2019-nCoV continue. This could be enabled through ACE2-Fc providing a triple mechanism of action: (1) Treatment of ACE2 deficiency and lung injury, (2) virus neutralization, and (3) immune effector recruitment. Beyond infected patients, ACE2-Fc could provide passive immunity to healthcare works at risk as another benefit. Going forward, it is recommended that physicians, scientists, and biotech industry in China and elsewhere pursue manufacturing an ACE2-Fc biologic agent right now, which can immediately advance into trials. A variety of different protein expression platforms (CHO, insect, yeast) could be utilized, depending on the particular contract manufacturerâ€™s expertise. Gene therapy could even be considered to make ACE2-Fc from a DNA or mRNA platform, but would have additional risk of uncertain delivery strategies and ultimately may slow down progress toward treating patients.</p>
