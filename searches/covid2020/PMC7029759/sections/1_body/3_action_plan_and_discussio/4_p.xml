<p>In an effort to help aide researchers and industry in China to combat 2019-nCoV, the protein sequence of the ACE2-Fc construct is provided ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). Different human Fc domains (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) could be contemplated, although IgG1 traditionally has the most potency for triggering anti-microbial responses

 </sup>. Similarly, an ACE2-Fc biologic without active ACE2 peptidase function could be explored as well. Given that gene synthesis of this sequence could happen within a week, the gene could be placed within the protein expression platform of choice shortly thereafter leading to protein production quickly. The availability of protein A columns and other techniques in the industry to purify antibodies would facilitate ACE2-Fc to quickly be repurposed on existing antibody manufacturing infrastructure existing in China.
