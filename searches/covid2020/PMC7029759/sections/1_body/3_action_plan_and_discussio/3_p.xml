<p>While a therapeutic strategy is being outlined here, the long-term goal of 2019-nCoV research would remain developing an effective vaccine to yield neutralizing antibodies, likely based on the S protein and specifically, the RBD protein. Such trials should happen as soon as possible, but may prove to be challenging to get the right level of immunogenicity, antigen presentation, adjuvant addition, and potent antibody stimulation. The virus could continue mutating, foiling different efforts to stimulate protective immunity. By comparison, 2019-nCoV cannot escape the ACE2-Fc treatment strategy, since it leverages its own cognate receptor for infection. As mentioned above, should 2019-nCoV attempt to escape this therapy via reduced ACE2 affinity binding, it would likely become less pathogenic, similar to the comparison of SARS versus human coronavirus NL63

 </sup>. Lastly, scaling the dose of any effective vaccine would also prove to be challenging depending on the vector format (e.g. viral vector versus mRNA versus protein), and even a fully protective vaccine would not help patients who are currently infected with the virus.
