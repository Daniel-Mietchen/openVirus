<p>The dire situations facing patients in outbreak scenarios demand quick responses by the healthcare community and the biotech industry. Unfortunately, many of the traditional options that guide drug development are inadequate for outbreaks; a process that takes years can’t help patients who are dying today, and economies that are being halted. In these situations, studies have often been conducted on compassionate use, and clinical trial approvals expedited. This was most recently seen in the 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak, where a variety of clinical trial candidates were studied. Many of these therapies failed, but ultimately a vaccine did emerge that was fully protective against the virus

 </sup>. It is important to note that, unlike the current situation with 2019-nCoV, Ebola had already been studied for years and this particular neutralizing vaccine made and tested in preclinical animal models years prior to the outbreak

 </sup>. For 2019-nCoV, beyond knowing the sequence of spike (S) protein of the coronavirus (GenBank:

Moreover, while a vaccine would be greatly effective in helping to stop the spread of 2019-nCoV, an effective therapy is also needed for the patients infected with 2019-nCoV today, similar to the situation of Ebola patients needing effective therapies while vaccines were being developed.
