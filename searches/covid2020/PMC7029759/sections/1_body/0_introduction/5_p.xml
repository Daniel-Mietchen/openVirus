<p>In this article, I will outline different potential treatment options that could be pursued as a therapy for 2019-nCoV virus, keeping the focus on agents that could be rapidly tested in patients today and broadly effective in spite of limited knowledge of the biology of 2019-nCoV. Simply stated, there is limited time for basic studies of 2019-nCoV in research labs, while patients need effective therapies today. I finally propose the best potential treatment option in my opinion, along with instructions on how to manufacture the therapy for testing in patients today.</p>
