<p>The first strategy would consist of administering to patients an agent that would bind to ACE2. The key advantage here is that the host ACE2 protein will not change, so there is no concern about escape from binding the therapeutic agent. Moreover, the virus will not have the ability to mutate and bind an entirely new host receptor in the time frame of this outbreak; such functional relationships are established by evolution over long periods. By analogy, the influenza virus changes the mutations on its surface to escape antibody neutralization every year, but it always focuses on using sialic acid on the cell surface as an entry receptor
