<p>An additional advantage of using ACE2 as a 2019-nCoV S protein neutralizing agent is that ACE2 administration could also directly treat the pneumonia pathophysiology. A portion of patients with SARS and 2019-nCoV infection develop pneumonia, which is characterized by pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

  <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
 </sup>. The viruses may, in part, cause ARDS through viral-induced ACE2 protein shedding and ACE2 protein decreased expression, both of which are mediated by S protein binding

 </sup>. Administration of recombinant ACE2 protein has been shown to improve acute lung injury through decreasing angiotensin II levels and the hormones subsequent binding to angiotensin II type 1a receptor

 </sup>. Recombinant ACE2 can also reduce ARDS in respiratory syncytial virus

 </sup> infection models. Based on these promising preclinical studies, recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) was moved into clinical trials in order to treat ARDS in critically ill patients. A phase I trial demonstrated rhACE2 was well tolerated with no effects seen on the cardiovascular system

 </sup>. It remains to be seen whether rhACE2 administration has the same clinical benefits in treating ARDS that have been seen in animal models, and whether ACE2-Fc administration could alleviate ARDS in 2019-nCoV patients.
