<p>The advantage of the Fc domain is endowing a longer-half life of the drug, which could enable healthcare workers to potentially be given drug doses prophylactically before seeing infected patients. Indeed, the half-life of recombinant ACE2 was extended from less than two hours to over one week in mice when formatted as a recombinant ACE2-Fc therapy in a study evaluating treatment for hypertension

 </sup>. One difference from the prior blocking agent strategies is that the effector functions of the Fc domain could be retained in this molecule, allowing recruitment of dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells through the CD16 receptor against viral particles or infected cells. This may facilitate faster activation of the host antiviral immune response and elimination of the virus, which was illustrated in a SARS mouse model where Fc engaging antibodies were more potent in eliminating SARS via activation of phagocytic cells compared to antibodies that neutralized virus alone

 </sup>. Overall, the ACE2-Fc fusion protein would have many of the same benefits of a traditional neutralizing antibody that would be sought as a treatment for the infection, but represent one with maximal breadth and potency since the 2019-nCoV could not escape its neutralization, given the same protein is also its receptor for cell entry. Indeed, it has been shown that the pathogenicity of SARS versus the more mild human coronavirus NL63 was related to a lower affinity of NL63 for human ACE2 versus SARS, with NL63 S protein reducing ACE2 levels less than SARS S protein

 </sup>. Therefore, if 2019-nCoV were to try to escape ACE2 neutralization via decreasing affinity, it would mutate into a less pathogenic virus. This is similar to the re-emergent SARS virus in 2003-2004, which had lower affinity for human ACE2 and resulted in less severe infection and no secondary transmission

 </sup>. Thus, 2019-nCoV could be presented with an evolutionary trap when faced with potential ACE2-Fc therapy, leading toward a more benign clinical course.
