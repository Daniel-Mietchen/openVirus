<p>A potentially more promising strategy would be to create an antibody-like molecule that would bind to the coronavirus itself, rather than shielding cells from being infected. For this strategy, it is proposed to use a soluble version of the ACE2 receptor that would bind to the S protein of 2019-nCoV thereby neutralizing the virus ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Again, the research on the SARS virus suggests this strategy is potentially promising. Soluble ACE2 receptor was demonstrated to block the SARS virus from infecting cells in culture

 </sup>; it is likely that 2019-nCoV has similar affinity for ACE2. In order to use ACE2 as a therapy to treat patients, it would be advisable to convert soluble ACE2 into an immunoadhesin format fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), thereby extending the lifespan of the circulating molecule, while also recruiting effector functions of the immune system against the virus. While not tested in an animal model, a previous study demonstrated that an ACE2 extracellular domain fused to the human IgG1 domain (ACE2-NN-Ig) was effective in neutralizing SARS coronavirus
