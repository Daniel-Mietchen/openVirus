<p>The proposed therapy for 2019-nCoV patients would consist of the extracellular domain of the ACE2 protein fused to a human immunoglobulin G Fc domain (

 </sup>, which also covers the peptidase domain necessary for ACE2 enzymatic function. It is possible a smaller portion of the extracellular ACE2 domain would be adequate for S protein binding, although a smaller version would lack enzyme activity beneficial in treating lung injury. Further studies are needed to define the minimal ACE2 domain necessary for 2019-nCoV S protein binding to construct even smaller ACE2-Fc proteins. While we do not know the structure of the 2019-nCoV S protein or how it binds to the ACE2 receptor yet, it is reasonable for now to assume that the same ACE2 protein domains utilized by the SARS virus are also bound by 2019-nCoV to infect cells.
