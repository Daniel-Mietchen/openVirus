<p>Ideal agents to fight 2019-nCoV would be approved small molecule drugs that could inhibit different aspects of the viral life cycle, ultimately inhibiting replication. Two classes of potential targets are viral polymerases

  <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
 </sup> and protease inhibitors 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
 </sup>, both of which are components of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antiviral regimens. Pilot clinical studies are already ensuing by desperate clinicians with various repurposed antiviral medicines. This has been done in every viral outbreak previously with limited success, outside of case reports 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
 </sup>. Indeed, during the Ebola outbreak, none of the repurposed small molecule drugs were definitively shown to improve the clinical course across all patients 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
 </sup>. The 2019-nCoV could be different, and there are initial positive reports that lopinavir and ritonavir, which are HIV protease inhibitors, have some clinical efficacy against 2019-nCoV, similar to prior studies using them against SARS 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
 </sup>. Research should continue to be undertaken to screen other clinically available antivirals in cell culture models of 2019-nCoV, in hopes that a drug candidate would emerge useful against the virus that could be rapidly implemented in the clinic. One promising example could be remdesivir, which interferes with the viral polymerase and has shown efficacy against MERS in mouse models 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
 </sup>. For further information, reviews of previous drug repurposing efforts for coronaviruses are provided 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
  <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
 </sup>. Though these repurposed medications may hold promise, it is still reasonable to pursue novel, 2019-nCoV specific therapies to complement potential repurposed drug candidates.
