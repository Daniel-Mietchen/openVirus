<p>As the outbreak continues, more patients who survived infection will become available to serve as donors to make antisera for 2019-nCoV, and a sizeable stock of antisera could be developed to serve as a treatment for the sickest patients. Unfortunately, the exponential growth of the outbreak would work against this strategy, since the growing number of cases would likely outstrip the ability of previous patients to provide donor plasma as treatment. Moreover, convalescent patient sera would have significant variability in the potency of antiviral effect, making it less ideal
