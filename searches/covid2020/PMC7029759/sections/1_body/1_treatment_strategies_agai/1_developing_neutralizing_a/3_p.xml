<p>An alternative strategy of generating neutralizing antibodies against 2019-nCoV S protein would be to immunize large animals (sheep, goat, cow) with the 2019-nCoV S protein, and then purifying polyclonal antibodies from the animals 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 </sup>. This strategy may serve an expedited service in the setting of an outbreak and has many advantages such as simplifying production and manufacturing, but has limited guarantees that each animal would produce neutralizing antisera, or what the antibody titer would be in each animal 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, there is also the human immune response against foreign immunoglobulins to other species, which would potentially complicate any treatment scenarios 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
 </sup>. In a truly desperate scenario, this strategy may be viable for a short-term, but would not easily scale in the 2019-nCoV outbreak, which is already rapidly multiplying.
