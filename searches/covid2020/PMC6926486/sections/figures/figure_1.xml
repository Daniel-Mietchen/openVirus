  <p>Phylogenetic and geographical attribution of MERS-CoV strains in camels imported into Saudi Arabia</p>
  <p>(A) Time-stamped phylogenetic tree indicating ORF4b region deletion types. Dots at tree nodes indicate statistically high (&gt;95%) node support and numbers indicate statistically lower (&lt;95%) node support, as indicated by the number. GenBank accession numbers are given in the 
   <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 5â€“6)</xref>. (B) Deletion patterns in ORF4b region. The diagram shows the variants found in clade C sequences (C1.1, C1.2, C2, and C3) of ORF4b compared with clade A and B sequences. MERS-CoV=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
