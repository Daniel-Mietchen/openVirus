 <caption> Phylogenetic and geographical attribution of MERS-CoV strains in camels imported into Saudi Arabia (A) Time-stamped phylogenetic tree indicating ORF4b region deletion types. Dots at tree nodes indicate statistically high (&gt;95%) node support and numbers indicate statistically lower (&lt;95%) node support, as indicated by the number. GenBank accession numbers are given in the appendix (pp 5â€“6). (B) Deletion patterns in ORF4b region. The diagram shows the variants found in clade C sequences (C1.1, C1.2, C2, and C3) of ORF4b compared with clade A and B sequences. MERS-CoV=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. </caption>
