 <caption> Phylogeographic and social network structure of MERS-CoV strains (A) Maximum clade credibility tree projected on a map of the study region. Outer circle sizes represent number of taxa associated with the country and inner circle sizes indicate deepest node per country, with a larger circle indicating a deeper node. (B) Social network inferred by Bayesian stochastic search variable selection approach. Only one network connection (Burkina Faso to Morocco) is identified as highly significant migration that does not adhere to the tree structure, based on Bayes factor. Significant indications for migration were obtained for Djibouti to Kenya, Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia to Jordan. MERS-CoV=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. </caption>
