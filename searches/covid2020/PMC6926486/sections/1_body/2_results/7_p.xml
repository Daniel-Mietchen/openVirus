<p id="para310">In the ORF3 region, we also observed some variations in the sequence of clade C3. Four of six sequences originating in Djibouti showed a 13 nucleotide deletion at the 3′-terminal part of ORF3, resulting in a new stop codon and an ORF3 predicted to be extended by six amino acids. In the same genomic region, one sequence also from Djibouti showed deletion of two nucleotides, resulting in a premature stop codon and a predicted truncated ORF3 (six amino acids shorter). Deletions and insertions at the 3′-terminus of ORF3 have been described before in viral strains from Nigeria, Burkina Faso (belonging to clade C1.1),
