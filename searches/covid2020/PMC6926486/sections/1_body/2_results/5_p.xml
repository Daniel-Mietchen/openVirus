<p id="para290">Our phylogenetic results support subclassification of African MERS-CoV lineages. Our results support the designation of clade C for all African strains of the virus. One subclade, designated C1.1, was previously found to contain strains from west Africa including from Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Morocco (designated as C1 by Chu and colleagues

With a similar internal diversity as clades C1.1 and C1.2, a novel subclade is identified, C2, that contains multiple novel viruses from the present study derived from Sudan and Djibouti, and viruses previously detected by us and others in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Kenya.
