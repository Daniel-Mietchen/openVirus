<p id="para270">We sequenced 124 viruses via RT-PCR and initial sequencing of the RT-PCR products suggested diverse clade associations. Based on preliminary phylogenetic analyses, we chose 46 individual samples (22 from the imported cohort and 24 of the Arabian samples) were chosen for full genome sequencing. All sequences were deposited under GenBank accession numbers MN541181–1304 (

Analysis of the assembled full or near-full genome scaffolds for recombination identified recombination signals for only one lineage resulting from recombination between previously circulating MERS-CoV lineages 3 and 5 (termed as a novel recombinant clade [NRC]) that emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2014–15.
