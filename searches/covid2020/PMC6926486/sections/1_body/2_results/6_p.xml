<p id="para300">Deletions in the ORF4b region have occurred recently in parallel lineages of African strains of the virus but not Arabian strains (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Deletion types are specific for their respective clades, cluster with viral strains that carry wild-type 
 <italic>ORF4b</italic> genes, and are highly region specific, indicating that geographical spread of these recent variants has not occurred (the topology of deletion type VII does not indicate convergence because it is merely deletion of one amino acid at the C-terminus). Viruses from Nigeria (C1.1) show particularly large deletions (types IIâ€“VI) that are not observed in other clades and suggest the geographical isolation of west African clades. Two sequences described in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (Bisha_1_2012; KF600620 and Riyadh_1_2012; KF600612.1) both belonging to clade B also show deletions (type 1) in ORF4b region, but with a distinct location.
