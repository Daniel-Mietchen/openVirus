<p id="para330">Despite the obvious importation of African virus lineages into Saudi Arabia, these viruses were not observed in the local camels under study in Saudi Arabia. Because previous studies have shown that serotype discrimination does not exist between MERS-CoV clades, our findings suggests that viruses in Saudi Arabia can remain endemic without introduction of new strains from Africa.

 </xref> Therefore, we focused on the reproductive rate of viruses in Saudi Arabia. Using a curated dataset of Arabian strains of the virus, we subjected all strains of the virus belonging to clade B, whether derived from humans or camels, to analyses of R
 <sub>e</sub> based on Bayesian birth death skyline analyses. We used this approach to obtain a dataset as complete as possible from a virus population that is close to the requirements of coalescent analysis—namely, panmixis and contingency as a population. Human-derived viral sequences were selected in such a way that they most likely represent primary cases; human-derived viruses were thus regarded as sentinels for enzootic evolution in camels, as previously reported.

 </xref> We only used the non-recombinant part of clade A and B virus genomes for this analysis because all recent isolates belonged to the NRC. The overall estimate of R
 <sub>e</sub> had a mean of 1·16, compatible with sustained endemicity. R
 <sub>e</sub> increased in the period between early 2017 and the middle of 2018, which we associate with the increased sampling effort by our study. We undertook two analyses of R
 <sub>e</sub>, one not including the novel viruses identified in this study (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3A</xref>) and the other including the full curated dataset (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>). By omitting the new sequences, the R
 <sub>e</sub> of MERS-CoV seems to decrease over time, highlighting that inclusion of new sequences is important to maintain an accurate picture of viral spread. Notably, this result is subject to previous assumptions made in our analyses.
