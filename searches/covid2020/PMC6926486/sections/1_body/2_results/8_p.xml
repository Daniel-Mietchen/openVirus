<p id="para320">Having inferred the structure of the viral phylogenetic tree, we aimed to establish the extent of virus transmission between countries and how it has affected the present geographical distribution of the virus. We did a phylogeographical analysis of between-location migration in discrete space with determination of significant migration rate parameters based on a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection procedure (

 </xref> The most significant indications for migration were obtained between Saudi Arabia and Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and Djibouti and Kenya. A high migration rate was also inferred between Burkina Faso and Morocco, but this rate was based on only one sequence and is therefore uncertain (
