<p id="para360">For the strains of the virus detected in Saudi Arabia, our study suggests that Arabian and African viruses have been separated for a time that exceeds the present observation period in all studies (ie, viruses have been separated since before 2012). Despite the steady import of clade C viruses, these African lineages do not appear to establish themselves in Saudi Arabia. We were surprised to see a similar age structure of imported compared with local virus-positive camels, suggesting that age-related contact barriers in husbandry would not explain the absence of transmission; however, notably, approximately 15% of sampled animals were of unknown age. Future studies to understand barriers to transmission should examine local camel populations in direct contact with imported camels, including their susceptibility based on serological testing.</p>
