<p id="para350">For African strain of the virus, our data confirm that the genome regions coding for the ORF4b and ORF3 regions have genetic instability. ORF4b encodes a phosphodiesterase that degrades 2′-5′-oligoadenylate and thereby prevents the activation of RNase L, an important cellular antiviral effector.

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The importance of this function for the spread of MERS-CoV and its ability to infect organisms under natural conditions is of interest. In-vitro studies suggest an attenuation of replication in viruses whose ORF4b region has undergone deletions.

 </xref> One could speculate that slightly deleterious mutants can sustain themselves better in so-called sink populations, whereas in source populations they would typically be out-competed by non-deleted strains that have higher reproductive fitness. Our data in combination with those of Chu and colleagues

 </xref> suggest that sink populations of MERS-CoV are hosted by west African camels and the possible geographical origin of all African MERS-CoV clades, thus the so-called source population is found in east Africa. The lesser density of camels in west Africa than in east Africa and the Arabian Peninsula supports the idea of an evolutionary dead end for MERS-CoV in that region. Particularly, Nigeria could be considered a dead end or sink area given the reduced density of camels towards the tropical zone of west Africa.
