<p id="para390">All MERS-CoV strains we isolated in Saudi Arabia belong to clade NRC circulating since 2014.

 </xref> Previously, clades in camels have subsequently been replaced by other clades, corresponding to a pattern of enzootic acute infections with short waves of prevailing individual subtypes.

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Although our data are not representative for all of Saudi Arabia, the evidence we collected by sampling from two sites as remote from each other as Jeddah and Riyadh indicates prolonged circulation of the recombinant MERS-CoV clade as a dominant strain. The increased detection rate of MERS-CoV RNA in camels from the Arabian Peninsula reported in this and previous studies
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> points towards differences in transmission dynamics and selection pressure. Further studies across a wider geographical area should be undertaken to understand potential changes in virulence and transmissibility associated with this strain. These studies should include direct comparisons between African and Arabian strains.
