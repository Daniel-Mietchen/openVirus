<p id="para370">Our analysis of population dynamics suggests that Arabian viruses can maintain endemic status without introduction of additional lineages. This finding corresponds with the observed isolation of Arabian virus lineages; however, these models are influenced by our prior assumptions, and therefore should be taken as a qualitative comparison of the contribution of present data rather than an exact quantitative assessment of R. Also, the point in time since Arabian strains of the virus have been isolated is impossible to infer because of our sample was restricted to virus samples from Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Future work with a wider sampling timeframe would be able to involve more refined clock models. Nevertheless, our results provide a reminder that continuous surveillance is necessary to trace and potentially discover changes in endemic activity.</p>
