<p id="para340">The present study provides further insight into the diversity of MERS-CoV. By analysing a large number of strains of MERS-CoV imported into Saudi Arabia from major African trade ports, we showed that Arabian strains of the virus are isolated from African strains and identify African MERS-CoV clades that were not as clearly distinguished in previous studies. Although all African strains of the virus share common ancestors in east Africa, only clade C1 presently appears in west and north Africa. Even if all African clades are represented in east Africa, no single place sampled so far in east Africa represents the whole diversity of MERS-CoV variants. Phylogeographical and social network analyses suggest that the present distribution of African clades is not predominantly shaped by transregional exchange but mainly reflects the phylogenetic tree structure. Camel trade, such as via the Sahel route connecting east and west Africa, corresponds with the present location of C1.1 strains but does not seem to cause a bidirectional exchange of strains between east and west Africa. Only for the clustering of Moroccan with west African strains and some strains from Kenya and Djibouti, the geographical distance between sites exceeds that of the attributed genetic distance, suggesting recent exchange through trade routes. Our phylogenetic tree structure shows that only parts of the diversity of clades C1 and C3 are represented in Sudan. Recombination between these clades is not observed, despite co-occurrence in Sudan. Therefore, Sudan appears to be a frequent recipient of viral lineages from other regions although we did not identify any strictly Sudan-specific lineages.</p>
