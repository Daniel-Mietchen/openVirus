   <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para50">We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for studies on the prevalence and diversity of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection from database inception until May 30, 2019, without language restrictions. We used the term “MERS*” combined with any single other term from the following list: “coronavirus*”, “camels*”, “dromedaries*”, “recombinant*”, “phylogeny*”, “phylogeography”, “Africa*”, “sequenc*”, “prevalence”, “age”, and “transmission”. Since the discovery of MERS-CoV in 2012, multiple sequencing studies have been done on viruses from camels and humans mainly in the Arabian Peninsula. Few studies exist on sequences from Africa, but all of these sequences are from camels rather than from humans, whereas most of the sequences from the Arabian Peninsula are from humans. Sampling bias is likely to affect all studies. The number of studies, and hence samples collected, from Africa is small compared with those from the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

  <p id="para70">We took advantage of sampling opportunities at the Port of Jeddah, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where large numbers of camels are continuously imported from Africa. By sampling before offloading from ships we made sure to take samples from animals that came directly from Africa and had no contact with local camels in Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, the resulting sample of African camel-borne MERS-CoV is the largest so far from the African continent. Our data enhance the overall picture of African strains of the virus, including the phylogenetic and geographical associations, which has enabled us to undertake comparisons of diversity against representatively large samples from the Arabian Peninsula. Our comparisons take sampling dates into account. We infer that Arabian and African strains of the virus have been separated for a time that exceeds the present observation period in all studies (ie, the virus strains have been separated since before 2012). We suggest that African strains of the virus are not transmitted in Arabian camels, despite large numbers of African camels frequently being imported into Saudi Arabia; and that Arabian strains of the virus might be self-sufficient in terms of their reproductive rate to maintain endemic circulation. By sampling from local camels in Saudi Arabia, we found that a novel clade of MERS-CoV that emerged in 2014 remains the only detected viral variant in camels from Saudi Arabia, suggesting that strains of this clade might be dominant over other viral strains that were co-endemic in camels before 2014.</p>

   <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para90">Our results suggest that a recently emerged clade of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia should be compared with African strains of the virus and with older Arabian strains to address the question of a potential increase in transmissibility and virulence. Change in transmissibility and virulence would affect the general assessment of pandemic risks emanating from MERS-CoV.</p>
