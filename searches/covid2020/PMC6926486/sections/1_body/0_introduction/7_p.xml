<p id="para130">Despite the continuous, extensive, and unidirectional export of African dromedaries, whether African MERS-CoV lineages reach the Arabian Peninsula and can be transmitted onward remains unknown. An important aspect of potential transmission is the age structure of imported camels, which are usually adult animals but can also include animals shipped towards the end of their first year of life. In large husbandries on the Arabian Peninsula, acute MERS-CoV infection mostly occurs in young camels younger than 1 year.

 </xref> Age at the time of infection might differ among imported camels because of different husbandry practices across the distribution area, with additional effects due to cohorting and mixing during animal transportation.
