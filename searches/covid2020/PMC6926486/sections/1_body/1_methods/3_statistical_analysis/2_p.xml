<p id="para220">To test the potential uncertainty introduced by use of recombinant sequences and the additional sequence information contributed to the phylogenetic tree, we repeated the phylogenetic analysis using only a non-recombinant sequence fragment (genome positions 91–11 343 in full genomes and 10 224–11 343 in partial sequences). This additional analysis generated essentially the same result with somewhat less statistical support for tree nodes at higher tree nodes but had no influence on main lineage separation (data not shown). Therefore, for the rest of analyses, we used our original full dataset.</p>
