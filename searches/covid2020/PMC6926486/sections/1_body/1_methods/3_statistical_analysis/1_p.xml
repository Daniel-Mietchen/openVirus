<p id="para210">We undertook phylogenetic analyses using Beast 1.10.4 software, with time-stamping based on the sampling dates of viral sequences; parameters used are listed in the 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 1–2)</xref>.
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>18</sup>
 </xref> We applied discrete phylogeographic diffusion models to the full dataset of viral strains to identify signs of geographical migration after the establishment of viral phylogenetic lineages, as has been previously published.
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>19</sup>
 </xref> We undertook analyses and visualisations of the geographical association of phylogenetic lineages and the geographical diffusion process using SpreaD3,
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>20</sup>
 </xref> and we used RDP version 4.95 for recombination analyses.
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>21</sup>
 </xref> To study viral transmission dynamics, we did an analysis of reproductive number on a curated dataset of Arabian viral genome sequences listed in the 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 7–9)</xref>. This analysis involved Bayesian birth death skyline analyses in Beast2,
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>22</sup>
 </xref> using previous assumptions of parameters in accordance with the methods of Dudas and colleagues (full details are in the 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix [pp 1–3]</xref>).
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>23</sup>
 </xref> We repeated our phylogenetic analysis to determine the robustness of our model.
