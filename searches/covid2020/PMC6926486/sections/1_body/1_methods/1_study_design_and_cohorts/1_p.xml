<p id="para150">In this prospective genomic study, we obtained respiratory samples from two different cohorts of dromedary camels. The first cohort comprised dromedary camels imported into Saudi Arabia on incoming vessels from Sudan or Djibouti at the Port of Jeddah. Samples were obtained over an almost 2-year period and were collected from about 15% of all camels aboard a ship. Sampling took place by entering the animal compartment and sampling accessible animals at random. Often ships held camels in two separate compartments, and so for our study we took samples from camels in both compartments. The second cohort comprised local camels from herds in Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Local samples were collected after the surveillance at the Port of Jeddah. In Jeddah, we collected 30% of samples from three camel farms approximately 45 km south of Jeddah and one farm approximately 50 km north of Jeddah, while we collected the other 70% of samples at an abattoir in the city before the camels were slaughtered. In Riyadh, we collected samples from camel farms and a camel market in a circle with a 60 km radius in and around the city.</p>
