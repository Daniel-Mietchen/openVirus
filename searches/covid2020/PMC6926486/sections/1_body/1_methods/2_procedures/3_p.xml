 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>) for full genome analysis using a combined RT-PCR and unbiased, non-amplified sequencing approach in an Illumina MiSeq instrument using 2 × 300 bp paired-end reads chemistry, as outlined in the 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 1)</xref>. The resulting sequences were assembled into full or near-full genome scaffolds and analysed for recombination.
