<p>In our index patient, his unstable clinical condition and the disseminated BCGitis dictated the decision of non-conditioned HSCT. The fact that he had a sustained lymphoid engraftment without conditioning is likely due to the severe T-cell dysfunction in this type of immunodeficiency. We do not have a clear explanation why our index case did not clear the disseminated BCGitis inspite of the recovered 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> lymphoproliferative response to PHA. One possibility is that the donor cells are anergic to BCG, but we could not test for that. So far, 13 out of 27 patients with IKK2 deficiency including our cohort had undergone HSCT. Only five were alive at the time of reporting, while those who did not receive HSCT succumbed to their disease in their infancy or early childhood. All survivors received myeloablative conditioning except our patient, while the remaining eight patients received non-myeloablative conditioning (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5), reduced intensity conditioning (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1), or no conditioning (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Although it is difficult to draw a conclusion from such limited number of reported patients, it seems that no conditioning or reduced intensity conditioning are not sufficient to cure the disease, and myeloablative protocol is needed to establish a good immune reconstitution.
