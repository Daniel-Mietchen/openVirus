<p>Patient V:5 underwent HSCT from a fully matched sibling (10/10) at 19 months of age. To save his life and because of the disseminated BCGitis, he received no conditioning and no GVHD prophylaxis. The CD34 dose was 9.2 Ã— 10
 <sup>6</sup>/kg. He had persistent lymphoid engraftment ranging from 7 to 40% (2 weeks to 2.5 years after HSCT) but no myeloid engraftment. He developed acute gut graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) 2 months after HSCT that responded to cyclosporine A and steroid treatment. Six months later, he developed chronic gut GVHD that was controlled by the same medications. Although his lymphocyte subsets [CD3 2,409/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (79%), CD4 1,211/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (40%), CD8 1,183/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (39%), CD19 296/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (10%), CD16/56 307/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (10%)] and their proliferation response to PHA (relative ratio 127%) showed good recovery, clinically, he did not show good immune reconstitution. He continued to suffer from disseminated BCGitis with bony involvement requiring frequent surgical interventions for faciozygomatic osteomyelitis. More than 4 years after the transplant, he was still on anti-mycobacterial medications (cycloserine, clarithromycin, ethambutol, and levofloxacin), monthly IVIG, and pentamidine prophylaxis. The last chimerism test was done at 4.5 years post-transplantation and showed 23% lymphoid engraftment and no myeloid engraftment. The severe disseminated BCGitis and history of GVHD precluded another trial of transplantation.
