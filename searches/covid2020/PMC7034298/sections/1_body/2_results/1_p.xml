<p>Our patients (V:1, V:2, V:5, and V:8) belong to two related Saudi families (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). They had early onset (2–4 months of age) severe infections caused by viruses, bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. The organisms include 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonuia, Candida albicans</italic>, CMV, and BCG (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which were associated with different clinical manifestations (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, all four patients had delayed umbilical cord separation at 2 months. They all displayed hypogammaglobulinemia. Where data is available, they had low absolute lymphocyte count (420–2,680 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), and their lymphocytes failed to respond to PHA mitogen (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A novel homozygous non-sense mutation in the 
 <italic>IKBKB</italic> gene, c.850C&gt;T (p. Arg284*) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B,C</xref>) was identified in patient V:5 within the candidate autozygome, and Sanger sequencing confirmed its segregation with the disease in the remaining living siblings and parents (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>). Three patients (V:1, V:2, and V:8) succumbed to their disease's infectious complications before commencing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
