<p>Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) is a transcription factor that plays a major role in various biological processes including the immune system development, activation, and regulation. This transcription factor complex is held inactive in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor of NF-kB (IκB). The classical activation pathway of NF-kB is triggered by a large number of extracellular stimuli through different receptors, which result in the phosphorylation of IκB by IκB kinase (IKK complex; IKKα, IKKβ/IKK2, and IKKγ/NEMO) and the subsequent release of NF-kB complex so it can translocate into the nucleus and drive target gene expression (
