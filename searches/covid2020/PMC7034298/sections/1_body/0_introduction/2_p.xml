<p>Different primary immunodeficiency disorders result from genetic defects that involve components linked to the NF-kB activation pathway (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). IKK2 deficiency is a recently described combined immunodeficiency disease that leads to impairment of NF-kB signaling (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Affected patients develop early severe and recurrent infections caused by bacterial, viral, fungal, and mycobacterial organisms. Unlike patients with IKKα and IKKγ mutations, IKK2-deficient patients do not typically have ectodermal dysplasia. Indeed, out of 22 patients with IKK2 deficiency described in the literature, only one patient has ectodermal dysplasia in the form of conical teeth (
