<p id="Par18">Aptamers can bind specifically to cell surface receptor molecules. Therefore, aptamer-based delivery systems can improve the cellular entrance of therapeutic agents. Aptamers can be designed for a wide range of applications through coupling with nanoparticles, drugs or other nucleic acids (nano carrier/ drug carrier) and play a major role in cell internalization (Fig.
