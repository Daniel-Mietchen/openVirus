<p id="Par24">During a viral challenge, infected cells encoding miRNAs is capable of influencing the host cell RNAi system and induce transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) at the viral genome, thus forming latency in viral infection. In addition, the presentation of exogenous siRNA, miRNA and shRNA into infected cells that target integrated viral promoters can significantly repress viral transcription through TGS [

 <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion. Actually, gp120 aptamer functionally delivered LTR-362 siRNA and induced TGS of HIV-1. Generally, receptor-directed aptamers can deliver small RNAs that functionally modulate HIV-1 infection as well as viral transcription [
