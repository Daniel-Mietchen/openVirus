 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> has been the most important human pathogen among the staphylococci with virulent toxin, by far. Although this organism is frequently a part of the normal human microflora, it can cause important opportunistic infections under the suitable conditions. 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> may cause a wide range of infections and quickly becomes resistant against many antibiotics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. One of the key virulence factors of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is alpha toxin, which can form heptameric pores in target cell membranes and cause tissue damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Overexpression of TNF-α shows a major role in the destruction of epithelial cells and cell death, which caused by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> alpha-toxin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Four aptamers, AT-27, AT-33, AT-36 and AT-49 were developed, which specifically prevented the alpha toxin-induced cytolysis and activation of TNF-α and IL-17. The viability of cells in the presence of toxin after treatment with these four aptamers increased from 50 to 60% to 85–90% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Moreover, enterotoxin B (SEB) from 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> can cause staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is rarely observed with other enterotoxins types. SEB, one of the virulence agents of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, acts as superantigen, and stimulates T cells to produce a storm of cytokines, which manifested to clinical complications and food poisoning [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A11 is a reported aptamer that prevented SEB-mediated expression of inflammatory cytokines genes, which mediating septic shock. A11 could significantly inhibit SEB activity at the onset of the toxicity cascade, prior to pathological activation of T cells [
