<p id="Par21">The effect of aptamer-conjugated nanoparticles on the biofilm formation has been also evaluated. In a report, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with significant antimicrobial activity were utilized as a nanomaterial to detect 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> as well as it could increase the toxic effect of antimicrobial agents on bacterial biofilms. A specific aptamer (PA-ap1) against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with the binding affinity in nM range had been developed. The conjugation of PA-ap1 to SWNTs could produce an effective concentration of the particles around bacterial cells, resulting in the disruption of bacteria accumulation. Compared with PA-ap1 and SWNTs alone, PA-ap1-conjugated SWNTs, caused a 36-fold higher inhibition of the biofilm formation. So, PA-ap1 increased the efficiency of anti-biofilm activity of SWNT [
