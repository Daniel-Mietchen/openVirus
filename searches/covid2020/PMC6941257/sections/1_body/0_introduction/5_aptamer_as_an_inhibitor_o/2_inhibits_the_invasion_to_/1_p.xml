<p id="Par30">Some of infectious pathogens invade the host immune cells, which made the treatment complex. For example, during the past 200 years, there are almost 1 billion deaths caused by MTB (an intracellular bacterium), which survives and multiply within macrophages. Most of the macrophages are killed by the bacilli that makes it harder to control infection in MTB-HIV coinfection and in the cases of appearance of multiple drug resistant strains [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. After the activation of macrophages, MTB begins to multiply within cells, then, other macrophages have developed an enhanced ability to kill the bacilli infected cells. Since, invasion to the macrophages is a major step of the MTB infection process, specific aptamers against virulent markers of MTB can prevent its invasion to the immune cell. NK2 aptamer as MTB specific DNA aptamer, with a Kd in the nM range, considerably inhibited virulent MTB invasion to macrophage, in vitro
