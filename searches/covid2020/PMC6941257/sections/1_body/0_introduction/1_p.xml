 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Incorrect use of antibiotics leads to side effects, and more importantly, the development of bacterial drug resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Due to the increased incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, antibiotic selection for infection control is restricted. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause numerous death every year and have a direct impact on the economy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, biofilm-forming bacteria, which result in chronic infections, have developed increased resistance against antibiotic treatments and host defense systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, new strategies for infection control and developing of novel antibiotics with less serious side effects, low toxicity and high efficacy seem necessary [
