<p id="Par36">Despite significant advances in the treatment of infectious diseases over the past half century, there are still many problems associated with the development of effective therapies and overcoming the side effects of antibiotics and pathogen drug resistance. Aptamers could provide a strong tool for the expansion of new therapeutic factors with the ability to block the function of pathogen microorganisms, also, they are simple and cheap therapeutic agents with less side effects compared to traditional antibiotics. Different therapeutic approaches of aptamers application have been reported in the field of microbial infections. For example, aptamer could inhibit biofilm formation or inhibit the functionality of microbial toxins, therefore, they could be used as new therapeutic tools to combat chronic infections. In addition, aptamers could be conjugated with nanoparticles, siRNA/miRNA, therapeutic drugs, and PDT agents to formulate a new therapeutic composite, which specifically kill bacterial cells. Application of aptamer technology in the treatment of microbial infections is still in its primal phase, and various challenges need to be overcome. This review provides recently developed aptamer-based technologies for microbial infections that illustrated this promising technology as an actual alternative to the traditional approaches in infection therapy. Aptamers are applicable tools in the detection and defense against unknown pathogens (bacterial, fungal, and viral agents) and can become a valuable anti-infective therapeutic tool for clinicians in recent future.</p>
