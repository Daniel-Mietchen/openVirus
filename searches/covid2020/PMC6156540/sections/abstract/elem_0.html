      <p>Ever since the development of the first vaccine more than 200 years ago, vaccinations
         have greatly decreased the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, famously leading
         to the eradication of small pox and allowing the restriction of diseases such as polio,
         tetanus, diphtheria, and measles. A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement
         of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma
         virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution
         and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor
         the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats.
         In recent years, the rapid spread of severe infections such as HIV, SARS, Ebola, and
         Zika have highlighted the dire need for global preparedness for pandemics, which necessitates
         the extremely rapid development and comprehensive distribution of vaccines against
         potentially previously unknown pathogens. What is more, the emergence of antibiotic
         resistant bacteria calls for new approaches to prevent infections. Given these changes,
         established methods for the identification of new vaccine candidates are no longer
         sufficient to ensure global protection. Hence, new vaccine technologies able to achieve
         rapid development as well as large scale production are of pivotal importance. This
         review will discuss viral vector and nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA and mRNA vaccines)
         as new approaches that might be able to tackle these challenges to global health.
