<p>The vector borne diseases 
 <bold>Dengue</bold>, 
 <bold>Chikungunya</bold>, and 
 <bold>Zika</bold> are transmitted by species of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and induce similar symptoms such as fever and severe joint pain. At present, more than half of the world's population lives in areas where these mosquito species are present. Infection rates for all these viruses have increased dramatically in the last decades: according to the WHO, cases of dengue fever have risen 30-fold in the past 50 years. Zika virus was first identified in non-human primates in Uganda in 1947 (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and has since caused several outbreaks in different areas with reported mild symptoms such as self-limiting febrile illness. Since 2014, however, outbreaks in Asia and the Americas have been linked to severe clinical manifestations, including Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults and congenital abnormalities, including microcephaly, following infection during pregnancy. A possible explanation for the emergence of these aggravated symptoms could be mutations introduced in the virus that allowed adaptation to the new environment and resulted in changes to pathogenicity. The occurrence of around one million laboratory confirmed cases of Zika in South America, with over 4,000 cases of microcephaly led to the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in February 2016 (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Likewise, several clinical trials are currently ongoing testing different technologies for a vaccine against Chikungunya or Dengue. However, with the exception of a vaccine against Dengue (Dengvaxia® developed by Sanofi Pasteur) no other vaccine has been licensed for these diseases. Of note, Dengvaxia® has recently been associated with increased risk of more severe disease in subjects who had never been exposed to the virus (
