 <bold>Self-ampifying mRNA vaccines</bold> are most commonly based on the alphavirus genome [reviewed in detail in (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>–
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>)], from which the genes encoding the structural protein have been replaced with the antigen of choice. Despite these gene deletions, the viral RNA is replicated and transcribed by the viral RNA polymerase. The full length mRNA of the self-amplifying mRNA vaccines is substantially larger (~9–10 kb for alphavirus systems) than in non-replicating mRNA vaccines, but contains the same essential elements such as a cap, 5′ and 3′ UTRs, and poly A tail (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). Of note, lower yields and increased occurrence of abortive constructs as a consequence of the large size of these vaccines pose challenges to vaccine production, that make manufacturing processes more difficult compared to non-replicating mRNA vaccines. The additional mRNA contains a sub-genomic promoter and a large ORF encoding for non-structural proteins which, following delivery of the vaccine into the cytosol, are transcribed in four functional components (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsp4) by the encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>). RDRP than produces a negative-sense copy of the genome which serves as a template for two positive-strand RNA molecules: the genomic mRNA and a shorter sub-genomic mRNA. This sub-genomic mRNA is transcribed at very high levels, allowing the amplification of mRNA encoding the antigen of choice. Hence, any genetic information encoded by the self-amplifying mRNA vaccine will be amplified many times, resulting in high levels of antigen expression from relatively low doses of the vaccine, which is an appealing attribute of self-amplifying mRNA vaccines compared to non-replicating mRNA vaccines (
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>). Upon injection in mice, LNP-formulated self-amplifying mRNA encoding firefly luciferase induced protein expression lasting almost two months upon IM delivery (
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>), while luciferase expression from protamine-formulated, non-replicating mRNA administered ID was usually only detected for several days (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>). However, potential interactions between the host and the encoded alphaviral non-structural proteins necessitate further investigation.
