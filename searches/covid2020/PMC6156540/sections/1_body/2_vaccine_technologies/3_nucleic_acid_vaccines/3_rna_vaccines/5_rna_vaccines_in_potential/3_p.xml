<p>A variety of preclinical studies have demonstrated the ability of 
 <bold>non-replicating mRNA</bold> vaccines to induce immune responses and confer protection against pathogens with pandemic potential such as ZIKV, EBOV and influenza. Importantly, some of these approaches are currently being tested in clinical trials. Pardi et al. demonstrated that ID immunization with LNP-encapsulated modified mRNA encoding the prME glycoproteins of 
 <bold>ZIKV</bold> elicited potent and durable neutralizing antibody responses that were protective in mice and NHPs (

 <italic>in utero</italic> transmission of ZIKV in mice (
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>). A Phase I/II, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of this ZIKV mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1325) was initiated in December 2016 with an estimated primary completion date in September 2018 (NCT03014089) (Table
