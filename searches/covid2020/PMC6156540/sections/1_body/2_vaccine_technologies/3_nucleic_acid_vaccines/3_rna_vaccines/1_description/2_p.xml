 <bold>Non-replicating mRNA</bold> contains the sequence of the antigen of choice flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). The advantages of using non-replicating mRNA vaccines compared to self-amplifying mRNA are rooted in the simplicity of the construct, the small size of the RNA, and the absence of any additional encoded proteins that could induce unintended immune responses (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). The design of optimized, efficiently translated mRNA for use as a vaccine has been reviewed previously (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>–
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>). Briefly, conventional non-replicating mRNA is obtained by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of a cDNA template, typically plasmid DNA (pDNA) produced in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The pDNA template is linearized using restriction enzymes and is transcribed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> into mRNA in a mixture containing recombinant phage DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (typically derived from T7 or T3 or Sp6 phage) and nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>). Upon purification, usually via FPLC or HPLC to remove any remaining product related impurities such as reaction components (i.e., enzymes, free NTPs, residual pDNA) or abortive transcriptional byproducts, a pure single mRNA product is obtained (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). Notably, purification of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed mRNA seems to be crucial for the amount of immunogen produced in target cells as demonstrated by up to 1,000-fold increased protein production in primary human DCs transfected with HPLC purified compared to unpurified mRNA (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>). The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed mRNA product contains a protein-encoding open reading frame (ORF) flanked by elements essential for the function of mature eukaryotic mRNA: a cap structure, joined to the 5′ and a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end, as well as 5′ and a 3′ untranslated regions (UTR) (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>–
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). The 5′ cap is vital for the creation of stable mature mRNA and increases protein translation via binding to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). The 5′ cap can be added either during the transcription by inclusion of a cap analog or anti-reverse cap (ARCA) in the reaction (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>), or subsequently, using the vaccinia virus capping complex (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). The UTRs, which can be of eukaryotic or viral origin, increase the half-life, and stability of the mRNA, resulting in higher expression of the protein (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>–
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>). The poly A tail of an optimal length is an essential regulatory element to enhance translation and can be either encoded into the DNA template or alternatively added enzymatically post transcription (

 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). The sequence of the ORF can be optimized using either enrichment of the GC content (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>–
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>) or by replacement of rare codons by frequently used synonymous codons leading to increased protein production from mRNA (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>). Utilization of chemically modified nucleosides can decrease innate immune activation and increase translation of the mRNA (
