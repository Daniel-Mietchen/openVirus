<p>DNA vaccines are generated by insertion of a eukaryotic expression cassette encoding for the antigen(s) of choice into a bacteria-derived plasmid. The plasmid backbone generally contains elements that permit propagation and selection of the vector in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, i.e., an origin of replication that supports high yields of the plasmid during bacterial growth and a selectable marker, mostly the bacterial antibiotic resistance gene against Kanamycin, which allows stable inheritance of the vector. Since regulatory safety concerns have been raised against the presence of non-functional sequences, especially the antibiotic resistance marker, for human use, the marker has been replaced or removed in new generations of DNA vaccines (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). In addition, minimal DNA constructs devoid of a bacterial backbone, such as the semi-synthetic minicircle DNA (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>) and the fully synthetic Doggybone™ (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>), have been developed. The eukaryotic expression cassette is comprised of a 5′ promotor, typically derived from cytomegalovirus (CMV) that supports high transcription levels, the gene of interest and a 3′ polyadenylation (poly A) signal, required for nuclear export, translation and stability of the transcript mRNA, that is usually obtained from rabbit β-globin or bovine growth hormone genes (
