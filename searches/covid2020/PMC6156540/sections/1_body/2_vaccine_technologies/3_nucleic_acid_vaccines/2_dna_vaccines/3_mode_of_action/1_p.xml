<p>Although a multitude of studies show that DNA vaccination is able to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses, through activation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> helper T cells, respectively, the exact mechanism of action remains to be evaluated. Upon entry in the cell, DNA vaccines are sensed by a variety of innate immune receptors. While TLR9 is not critical for DNA vaccine efficacy, the STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathways and the AIM2 inflammasome are involved in DNA vaccine mode of action and other factors might additionally be involved (

Early experiments testing bombardment with DNA coated gold particles delivered ID demonstrated transfection of both keratinocytes and professional APCs, i.e., Langerhans cells, explaining the source of both MHCI and MHCII restricted antigen recognition by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> helper T cells, respectively (

 <sup>+</sup> T cells upon DNA vaccination (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>), the most likely mechanism in this scenario seems to be cross-priming and presentation of both MHCI and MHCII restricted antigens by professional APC upon phagocytosis of transfected somatic cells.
