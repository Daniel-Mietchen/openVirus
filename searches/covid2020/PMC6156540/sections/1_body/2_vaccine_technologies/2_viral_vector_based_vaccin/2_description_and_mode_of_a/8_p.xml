 <bold>Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)</bold>, a member of the 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> family, is an enveloped virus containing a single stranded, negative-sense RNA of ~11 kb. The virus naturally infects livestock with sporadic infections found in humans (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The resulting low risk of pre-existing immunity and the lack of a DNA intermediate during viral replication makes VSV attractive as a safe vaccine for applications in humans. The establishment of a reverse genetic system for VSV in 1995 has allowed manipulation and propagation of the virus (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). VSV is generally employed as an attenuated vector, which is achieved by different methods, such as introducing mutations in the viral matrix (M) protein, rearranging the order of the viral protein, insertion of non-viral proteins and partial or complete deletion of the viral glycoprotein (G), the determinant for viral infectivity (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Attenuation is essential for vaccine safety, since neurovirulence of the wild-type VSV has been detected upon intracranial inoculation in animal models (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Transgenes can be inserted at different positions in the viral genome resulting in varying levels of transgene expression. A common method for transgene insertion replaces the G protein, which alters tissue tropism of the virus (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The amount of additional genomic material stably accepted in the genome is 4â€“5 kb (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). VSV can be grown to high titers in most mammalian and insect cell lines. Depending on the way the virus has been manipulated, methods for viral propagation may vary.
