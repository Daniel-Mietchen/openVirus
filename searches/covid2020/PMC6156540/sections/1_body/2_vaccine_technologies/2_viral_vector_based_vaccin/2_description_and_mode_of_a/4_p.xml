<p>Adenoviral vectors are able to induce potent antibody as well as T cell responses with variations in the immune response depending on the serotype employed (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Replication-deficient Ad5, one of the most widely used adenoviral vectors, is able to induce exceptionally potent CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell as well as antibody responses (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, the widespread pre-existing immunity to this virus in the human population, that can inhibit transgene expression and inactivate the viral vector, hampers its clinical use (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This issue has been met by developing adenoviral vectors of non-human origin, such as the chimpanzee virus derived vector ChAd63 (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). An alternative approach is the selection of rare serotypes with low prevalence in humans such as Ad26 or Ad35 (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) which induce enhanced memory and more poly-functional CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells compared to Ad5 (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).
