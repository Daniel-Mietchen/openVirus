<p>Recombinant measles viruses are able to induce high levels of both humoral and cellular immune responses against the transgene (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Importantly, MV is able to infect cells of the immune system, including macrophages and dendritic cells, thus supporting delivery of target antigens directly to antigen-presenting cells (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). T cell-mediated responses to MV are dominated by a CD4
 <sup>+</sup> phenotype, unlike the more CD8
 <sup>+</sup> dominated response to adenoviral vectors, which might be a consideration for vaccine development. Since live attenuated MV is routinely used as a vaccine in child immunization programs in many countries, pre-existing immunity to MV as a viral vector has been raised as a concern. However, studies in mice and macaques showed no impact of previous MV exposure on transgene immunity (
