 <bold>Measles virus</bold> (MV), a common human pathogen, belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>. MV is an enveloped virus with a non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~16 kb. Measles virus vaccines have been generated by serial passaging of infectious virus through different cell lines resulting in a live attenuated virus that is replication deficient in humans. The introduction of numerous mutations in this process has established a highly stable vaccine for which reversion to pathogenicity has never been observed (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Moreover, MV is unable to integrate into the host genome and a lyophilization process for MV vaccine has been established, increasing the thermostability of the naturally unstable virus. MV vaccine induces extremely durable responses with both antibodies and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cell persisting as long as 25 years post vaccination (
