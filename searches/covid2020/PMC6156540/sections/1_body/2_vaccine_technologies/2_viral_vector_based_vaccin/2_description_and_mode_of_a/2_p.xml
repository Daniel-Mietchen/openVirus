 <bold>Adenovirus (Ad) vectors</bold> are among the most commonly employed viral vectors, with vast amounts of both preclinical and clinical studies assessing their protective efficacy against a variety of infectious diseases available. 
 <italic>Adenoviridae</italic> are non-enveloped viruses with an icosahedral capsid and a linear double-stranded DNA genome, whose size ranges from 30 to 40 kb. Next to a multitude of adenoviruses occurring in different animal species, there are 57 identified human adenovirus that are classified into seven species Aâ€“G. Adenoviral receptors are expressed on the surface of most human cells, allowing a broad tissue tropism of the virus (
