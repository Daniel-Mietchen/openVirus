<p>Since viral-vectors are complex vaccines that induce strong immune responses, the use of additional adjuvants is generally not required. Some clinical studies have tested recombinant viral vaccines in combination with additional immune-stimulating components (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) but found no increase in immunity in the adjuvanted group (
