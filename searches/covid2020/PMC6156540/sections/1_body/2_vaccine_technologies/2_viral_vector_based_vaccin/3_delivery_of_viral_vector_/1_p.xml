<p>Administration of viral-vectors can take place by different routes: next to intramuscular vaccination, intranasal (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), and oral vaccination (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) have been tested for different viruses in clinical studies. Next to the ability of the employed virus to infect certain tissues, the choice of immunization route is dependent on several considerations. The route of administration affects the quality of the induced immune response and the choice of application route thus depends on the target pathogen, i.e., if a mucosal response is required for inducing protection, oral or nasal delivery of the vaccine may be preferable over parenteral applications. In addition, the route of administration needs to be reliable and easy to perform in an outbreak situation, arguing for established routes of vaccination such as oral or intramuscular administration (
