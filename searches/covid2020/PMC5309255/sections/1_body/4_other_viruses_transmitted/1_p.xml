<p>Apart from viruses causing gastroenteritis, there are viruses causing food- and waterborne diseases that are associated with a variety of other syndromes. The second most common disease syndrome is hepatitis, caused by HAV, a fecal-orally transmitted virus (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Havelaar et al., 2015</xref>). By decreasing natural exposure in regions with low endemicity, the susceptibility of the population for outbreaks of HAV disease in these regions is increasing (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Newell et al., 2010</xref>). Because of increased globalization, contamination of food products by viruses prevalent in food producing regions can increase the risk of outbreaks in these regions. Several outbreaks of HAV infection have been reported in recent years both in the USA and Europe (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Bruni et al., 2016</xref>). Especially fresh (imported) food products (e.g., fresh frozen berries, pomegranate seeds, and sun-dried tomatoes) have been identified as sources of the virus (

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Tavoschi et al., 2015</xref>). Tracking the foodborne source of infection is challenging for HAV, because of an underestimation of the contribution of food as a source of infection due to the long incubation period in infected individuals (
