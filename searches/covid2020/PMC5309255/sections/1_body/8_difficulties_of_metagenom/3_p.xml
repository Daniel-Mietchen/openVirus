<p>Third, assigning all assembled genomes to a reference genome is hampered by miss-annotations and incomplete reference databases. One example is “non-A, non-B hepatitis virus”, a sequence present in the NCBI GenBank, which was miss-annotated and the sequence was shown to belong to a bacteriophage (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Cantalupo et al., 2011</xref>). The volume of sequencing databases is increasing rapidly, however, sequence annotations and metadata are of varying levels of quality and the speed of analysis decreases with increasing reference datasets. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between the rate of success of annotation of a sequence against a smaller curated reference dataset, and reliability of annotation using a large reference database with less-well curated annotation data.
