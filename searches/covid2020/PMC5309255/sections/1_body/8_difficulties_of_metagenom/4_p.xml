<p>Sequence homology of multiple reference genomes can lead to the spurious assignment of sequencing reads to one of these genomes. An example of the impact of spurious read annotation was the alleged detection of genomic material of 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> in the New York subway system. Further inspection showed that the reads mapping to 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> could have mapped with similar likelihood to other bacterial species (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Afshinnekoo et al., 2015</xref>). Such miss-annotations of metagenomic sequences need to be anticipated and carefully addressed before using metagenomics in surveillance and diagnostic applications.
