<p>Although the list of viruses causing acute gastroenteritis is long, norovirus ranks among the top causes of diarrheal disease (

Reporting of outbreaks suggests that the food- and waterborne disease transmission route is relatively rare, but provides an underestimate, bearing in mind that it may be hard to recognize a food- and waterborne transmission route in community-acquired diarrheal disease. To quantify the burden of all diarrheal disease attributable to foodborne transmission, the World Health Organization commissioned a study that combined data from surveillance and exhaustive literature reviews with a systematic approach to calculation of the fraction of disease attributable to food contamination (
