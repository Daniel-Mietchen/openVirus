<p>Transmission via the food- and waterborne route is a common mode of spread of a wide range of viruses. Many commonly recognized food- and waterborne infections are caused by viruses that are transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Particularly caliciviruses (norovirus, sapovirus) can cause diarrhea and vomiting and less commonly astroviruses, rotaviruses, and adenoviruses (

High levels of viral shedding through stool and vomit lead to dispersal in the environment. Moreover, the stability of many food- and waterborne viruses allows for prolonged persistence in the environment. Food- and water associated transmission is also suspected to enhance the spread and emergence of zoonotic viruses (e.g., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus and Nipah virus) and facilitates the occurrence of zoonotic events though the handling of bushmeat (Ebola virus) (
