<p>Bacteriophages, although not directly pathogenic to humans, could play a role in human health and disease by influencing the gut microbiome. Sequencing data from human gut samples presents a large diversity of bacteriophages in the human gut (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Reyes et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to bacteriophages, untargeted sequencing of sewage samples has shown the presence of large quantities of different plant viruses (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Because of the presence of numerous infectious plant virus particles in human fecal waste there is ongoing research on the effect of these viruses in human health and disease (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Colson et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, there is ongoing research into the impact of bacteriophages on human health through their modulating effect on the gut microbiome (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Reyes et al., 2012</xref>), and thereby, gut immunity (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Honda and Littman, 2016</xref>). In what way bacteriophages protect or expose the human gut to bacterial or viral pathogens has yet to be further investigated. However, using metagenomic sequencing it will at least be possible to recognize the presence of unknown fecal-oral passengers.
