<p>Metagenomic sequencing has already been used in the sampling of the world’s oceans to estimate the global viral diversity (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Hingamp et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, metagenomics can be used in environments associated with viruses spread via the food- and waterborne route (

 </bold>), which gives an overview of all these viruses and circumvents the mentioned sampling biases. The potential of such an approach for food-related purposes was exemplified by 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Hellmér et al. (2014)</xref> who conducted a multi-species viral surveillance study and, albeit not metagenomic sequencing based, were able to detect several food- and waterborne viruses in sewage. Interestingly, norovirus and HAV, detected in sewage, could be related to hospitalized patients diagnosed with the viral infection in the catchment area of the sewage system. Moreover, they detected a peak in the level of norovirus several weeks before the outbreak was reported in the hospital in that area (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Hellmér et al., 2014</xref>). This demonstrates the potential power of shifting the scope of surveillance of food- and waterborne viruses from the hospital to the environment. Untargeted metagenomic sequencing has been shown to be able to capture a multitude of viruses in sewage samples in several studies. Moreover, comparison between sewage viromes from Nigeria, Nepal, Bangkok, and California, four geographically distant locations, showed distinct differences in the subsets of detected human viruses (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the average sequence similarity between the reference sequences stored on the NCBI GenBank and the human viruses detected in the samples from California was higher than those from the other locations. This may indicate a bias towards American viruses in view of human virus diversity in this database (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2012</xref>). A study that looked at viruses from sewage capable to infect human epithelial cells was able to detect a large number of bacteriophages and several different species of the

 <italic>Papillomaviridae</italic> viral families.(
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Aw et al., 2014</xref>). Another more recent evaluation of untargeted metagenomic sequencing for surveillance purposes retrieved full genomes of Adeno-associated virus-2 as the most prominent mammalian virus in the sample. This virus is generally not associated with any pathology and cannot be grown in cell cultures, possibly underestimating its role in diarrheal disease (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Furtak et al., 2016</xref>). A striking fact of these studies is the number of sequencing reads that are found that share no sequence similarity with current reference databases. Percentages of unmapped sequences range from 37 to 66% (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Cantalupo et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2012</xref>). Whether these sequences represent novel viruses that can be transmitted via the food- and waterborne route remains to be determined. Nevertheless, these preliminary studies show the potential of untargeted metagenomic sequencing to detect novel and known human pathogens. Sampling a larger variety of locations, performing longitudinal studies of the same environment and deeper sequencing will provide more information on what environmental metagenomic sequencing can contribute to the monitoring of viral trends and viral diversity.
