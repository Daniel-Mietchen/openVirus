<p>Metagenomics is a term used for experiments in which all nucleic acids in a certain sample are sequenced. For bacteria, historically, the diversity of a sample used to be expressed by performing phylogenetic analyses based on 16S ribosomal RNA (

However, since viruses lack such a universally conserved motif, viral metagenomics refers to the attempt to recover full and partial genomes of all viruses present in the sample. Viral metagenomic analysis protocols generally start with procedures to remove host and bacterial cells followed by nuclease treatment to remove free nucleic acids. Often, the remaining nucleic acids are amplified using randomly primed (RT-) PCR and finally sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology. Viral metagenomics has great potential in surveillance of viruses in the global food chain because of its sensitivity, broad detection range, and detailed information of the detected virus (
