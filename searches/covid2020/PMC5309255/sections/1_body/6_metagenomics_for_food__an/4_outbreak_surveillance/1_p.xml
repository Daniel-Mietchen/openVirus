<p>One of the main promises of surveillance using metagenomic sequencing is that of concomitant clinical application (diagnosis of patients) and public health application (typing and cluster analysis to trace of food- and waterborne outbreaks) (

 </bold>). Using metagenomic sequencing, the effort of detecting and genotyping of a virus can be combined to trace an outbreak, regardless of prior knowledge of the virus, provided the data is analyzed in combination with relevant metadata. The use of this integrative approach has been demonstrated in an investigation of a hospital outbreak of human parainfluenza virus, which was investigated using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Greninger et al., 2016</xref>). Both the detection of the virus, the diagnosis of the disease and the establishment of viral clusters and transmission routes could be derived from the metagenomic sequencing data. A similar approach should enable investigation of viruses related to food- or waterborne diseases and distinguishing between a food- and waterborne and a person-to-person transmission route. In such investigations, speed is of the utmost importance, therefore on-site sequencing strategies, enabled by novel portable sequencing platforms such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Hoenen et al., 2016</xref>), have potential in fast local outbreak detection and disease monitoring (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Arias et al., 2016</xref>). Recent reports have shown potential in metagenomic detection of hepatitis C, chikungunya, Ebola and Zika virus in hospital settings (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Greninger et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Sardi et al., 2016</xref>). The development of on-site sequencing technology is still in its infancy, however, and it remains to be investigated if food-related viral outbreaks will be traceable and can deliver whole-genome based viral dynamics analysis analogous to the investigation of the Ebola outbreak of 2014 (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Gire et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Quick et al., 2016</xref>). However, the same on-site technology has been shown to be beneficial in tracing foodborne salmonella (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Quick et al., 2015</xref>). Aspects of current on-site sequencing technologies that need to be improved for viral metagenomic sequencing are the limited throughput and sequence quality, which limit the detection of low-level viral genomes and minor variants. Nevertheless, the use of near-real-time sequencing of Ebola and Zika during the recent outbreaks has received a lot of attention and has shown that the technology works.
