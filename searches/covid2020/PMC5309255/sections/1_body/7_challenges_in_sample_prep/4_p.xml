<p>To increase the viral specific output of metagenomics sequencing approaches sample preparation methods can be used to reduce non-viral genomic material or specifically select for viruses. Approaches that are being investigated, range from different extraction protocols (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Conceição-Neto et al., 2015</xref>) to using a virome specific capturing chip (

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Oude Munnink et al., 2013</xref>). Paradoxically, however, the sequencing capacity of high throughput metagenomic sequencing is sensitive enough to pick up contaminants from the lab reagents, or from previous experiments (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Gruber, 2015</xref>). These pose a challenge to the interpretation of metagenomic data. To limit contamination, laboratories in which samples are processed are often separated from those in which nucleic acids are amplified and equipment is UV treated and cleaned with bleach. Additionally, alternating the sample-specific DNA barcodes in multiplex sequencing experiments reduces contamination from previous runs. Nevertheless, it is recommended to include both negative control samples, which have been processed similarly, but are believed to contain no viruses, and positive control samples, that contain known quantities of a variety of viruses (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Lusk, 2014</xref>). Alternatively, bioinformatics tools such as DeconSeq (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Schmieder and Edwards, 2011</xref>), have been developed to check for signals of regularly found lab contamination in the sequencing data. In conclusion, as contamination of samples and equipment may not be avoidable, its likelihood should be taken in consideration when using metagenomic sequencing technology for food-related surveillance applications.
