<p>Given the number of different viral pathogens potentially associated with food- and waterborne transmission their detection has not been straightforward. Partly because many of these pathogens lack cell culture systems that are sensitive and robust enough for application in routine settings (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Amar et al., 2007</xref>). The entry point for disease-based surveillance of viruses spreading by food and water is the reporting of patients presenting to a clinician. However, patients only present themselves in case of a severe symptomatic infection, or in case self-help is not sufficient. Mild symptoms are therefore generally not registered creating a bias in surveillance. This phenomenon is captured in the surveillance pyramid (

 </bold>), and the full extent of disease can only be captured through epidemiological studies addressing incidence and etiology at community level coupled with severity of a range of enteric pathogens (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">de Wit et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Tam et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, it is challenging to distinguish between foodborne outbreaks and outbreaks caused by direct contact between humans. Classic clinical symptoms of foodborne disease vary, ranging from diarrhea and vomiting to abdominal cramps and general malaise, which makes it hard for clinicians to pinpoint the exact causative agent. This leads to misdiagnosis if the diagnostic workup is selective, and if there are no obvious signs of food-related exposure (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">de Graaf et al., 2016</xref>). Susceptibility to fecal-orally transmitted viruses may also be influenced by the established microbiome and virome in the host population, of which the prior is shown to differ between different locations and age groups (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>). It is reasonable to think that the differences in the gut environment are more pronounced between countries with larger social and economic differences such as first and third world countries, which often differ in their resident pathogens (

 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Hay et al., 2013</xref>). The role of the gut virome, in addition to the gut microbiome, is a relatively new concept and has been described as potentially having influence on gut health and therefore expression of disease (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Cadwell, 2015</xref>). Because of under and miss-diagnoses, clinical surveillance likely only captures the tip of the iceberg of food- and waterborne viral disease cases.
