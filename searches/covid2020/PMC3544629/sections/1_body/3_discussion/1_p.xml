<p>LRTIs and particularly RSV associated LRTIs account for a substantial number of pediatric hospitalizations and utilize an important number of beds. In British Columbia during 2008â€“10, LRTI as the primary diagnosis accounted for a significant proportion of diseases of the respiratory system in all children &lt;19 years of age and the majority of hospitalizations for diseases of the respiratory system in infants &lt;1 year of age. Infants &lt;1 year of age accounted for 47 and 77% hospitalizations due to pediatric LRTIs and LRTIs specifically due to RSV, respectively. Acute bronchiolitis due to RSV was the most frequently listed LRTI as the primary diagnosis in infants &lt;1 year of age. There was considerable seasonal variation in the incidence of hospitalizations. Most pediatric hospitalizations attributable to LRTIs in British Columbia hospitals occurred between November and April.</p>
