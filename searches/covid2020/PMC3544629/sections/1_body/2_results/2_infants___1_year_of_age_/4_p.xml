<p>Infants &lt;1 year of age accounted for 47 and 77% of LRTI and RSV-specific LRTI hospitalizations, respectively, among all children (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Hospitalization rates for LRTI as the primary diagnosis among infants &lt;1 year of age were significantly increased compared to children 1–&lt;19 years of age (2410/100,000 population &lt;1 year of age 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 235/100,000 children 1–&lt;19 years of age; P &lt;0.0001). Bed-days rates for LRTI as the primary diagnosis were significantly increased among infants &lt;1 year of age compared to children 1–&lt;19 years of age (15,663/100,000 population &lt;1year of age 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 1473/100,000 children 1–&lt;19 years of age; P &lt;0.0001). Considering the bed days spent by those patients, this is an equivalent bed rate of 21.45 beds/100,000 infants &lt;1 year of age per day and 2.02 beds/100,000 children 1–&lt;19 years of age per day (P &lt;0.0001).
