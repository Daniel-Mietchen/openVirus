<p>Population projections estimated a 6.6% growth in the pediatric population by 2020 and 17.2% growth by 2030 (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). Assuming the same incidence of LRTI hospitalizations required by pediatric patients, these projections predicted a growth in LRTI bed-days of 5.5% among all children &lt;19 years of age and 16.3% among infants &lt;1 year of age by 2020 and 16.2% among all children &lt;19 years of age and 14.9% among infants &lt;1 year of age by 2030. In 2020, the average number of acute care beds required to treat pediatric LRTIs will be 20.7 among all children 0â€“&lt;19 years of age including 11.2 among the subpopulation of infants &lt;1 year of age. This will increase to a maximum bed occupancy of 68 among all children including 48 in infants &lt;1 year of age during the peak months for LRTI hospitalizations. In 2030, 22.8 acute care beds will be needed among all children &lt;19 years of age including 11.0 among infants &lt;1 year of age. This will increase to a maximum bed occupancy of 74 beds among all children including 47 among infants &lt;1 year of age in the winter months (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref>).
