         <p>Pediatric LRTI hospitalizations are a significant burden on patients, families, and
            healthcare systems. This study determined the burden of pediatric LRTIs on hospital
            settings in British Columbia and the benefits of prevention strategies as they relate
            to healthcare resource demand.

         <p>LRTI inpatient episodes for patients &lt;19 years of age during 2008–2010 were extracted
            from the BC Discharge Abstract Database. The annual number of acute care beds required
            to treat pediatric LRTIs was estimated. Sub-analyses determined the burden due to
            infants &lt;1 year of age and high-risk infants. Population projections were used to
            forecast LRTI hospitalizations and the effectiveness of public health initiatives
            to reduce the incidence of LRTIs to 2020 and 2030.

         <p>During 2008–2010, LRTI as the primary diagnosis accounted for 32.0 and 75.9% hospitalizations
            for diseases of the respiratory system in children &lt;19 years of age and infants &lt;1
            year of age, respectively. Infants &lt;1 year of age accounted for 47 and 77% hospitalizations
            due to pediatric LRTIs and pediatric LRTI hospitalizations specifically due to respiratory
            syncytial virus (RSV), respectively. The average length of stay was 3.1 days for otherwise
            healthy infants &lt;1 year of age and 9.1 days for high-risk infants (P &lt;0.0001). 73.1%
            pediatric LRTI hospitalizations occurred between November and April. Over the study
            timeframe, 19.6 acute care beds were required on average to care for pediatric LRTIs
            which increased to 64.0 beds at the peak of LRTI hospitalizations. Increases in LRTI
            bed-days of 5.5 and 16.2% among &lt;19 year olds by 2020 and 2030, respectively, were
            predicted. Implementation of appropriate prevention strategies could cause 307 and
            338 less LRTI hospitalizations in &lt;19 year olds in 2020 and 2030, respectively.

         <p>Pediatric LRTI hospitalizations require significant use of acute care infrastructure
            particularly between November and April. Population projections show the burden may
            increase in the next 20 years, but implementation of effective public health prevention
            strategies may contribute to reducing the acute care demand and to supporting efforts
            for overall pediatric healthcare sustainability.
