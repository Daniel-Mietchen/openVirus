<p>Currently, CEPI has invested in five technologies for Lassa fever vaccines using recombinant viruses and nucleic acid-based immunization. Indeed, the first CEPI-sponsored phase I clinical trial began in May 2019 using Inovio Pharmaceuticals’ DNA technology (NCT03805984) [

There are four vaccine candidates under investigation for MERS-CoV, again with a similar combination of technologies. However, two of the recombinant viruses being tested have already gained useful clinical data prior to CEPI funding and thus are in a more advanced state of development. In the program for Nipah, four vaccines are in development and include recombinant viruses and recombinant proteins. In all cases, it is expected that phase I studies will begin within 18–24 months, with phase II studies following shortly afterward. Recent funding has been made available in partnership with the European Commission for RVF and Chikungunya. Two RVF vaccine candidates are in development and consist of attenuated viruses, other two candidates are under development for Chikungunya. Investments have also been made into three platform technologies based on nucleic acids and recombinant proteins. All three have the potential to produce a vaccine rapidly in the event of an emergency (Table
