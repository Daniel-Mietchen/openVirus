<p>After linkage of fragments it can be necessary to determine the order of the fragments by generating overlaps between contigs. Order might be inferred from paired end data, if available, but can also be deduced from augmented assemblies, produced by applying different assembly and alignment parameters. Wrong assemblies at contig ends can be the reason that no further overlap has been found by an assembler. Editing of contig ends improves wrong assemblies and facilitates subsequent gap closing with a different assembler.</p>
