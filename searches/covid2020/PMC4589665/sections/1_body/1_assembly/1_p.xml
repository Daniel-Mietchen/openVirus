<p>A metagenome dataset consists not only of reads of the (novel viral) target genome but also of all other genetic material present in the sequenced sample, at varying concentrations and sequencing depth. If the viral load in the sample is sufficient to produce overlapping sequencing reads, it is in theory possible to create longer, contiguous sequences from the viral genome. A first step in retrieval of a viral genome from a metagenome is therefore to assemble all reads, followed by identification of (part of) the target genome. Unfortunately, only very few assemblers were developed with virus discovery metagenomics in mind. A specific challenge here is the much greater sequence diversity in viruses compared with host or bacterial genomes. In contrast to assembly in general metagenomics where assembly of all sequencing reads is necessary to shed light into population and functions within the metagenomic community (Howe and Chain, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), only assembly of a single or few targets (namely the virus in question) but to a high level of completeness is pursued. These targets might have highly uneven coverage and can be very dissimilar to sequences of known pathogens which make reference-guided assembly impossible.
