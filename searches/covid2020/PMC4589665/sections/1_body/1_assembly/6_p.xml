<p>Both assemblers were designed for paired-end short read data. To achieve the assembly of long 454 metagenome reads, an algorithm was developed that sequentially uses an overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) assembler (Newbler, Roche 454) followed by several rounds of greedy assembly (CAP3, Huang and Madan, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) until convergence (Sch√ºrch et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Application of this algorithm to a data set derived from a cell culture supernatant containing a virus isolated from tissue of a dead white-beaked dolphin (
 <italic>Lagenorhynchus albirostris</italic>) lead to long contigs of a novel dolphin rhabdovirus that was closely related to fish rhabdoviruses of the genera 
 <italic>Perhabdovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Vesiculovirus</italic> (Siegers et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These contigs were combined with fragments derived by other assembly methods to retrieve a full viral genome (Smits et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Such a sequential assembly strategy for short-read data using an OLC and a de Bruijn graph assembler is also proposed by Deng et al. (Deng et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and shows great promise for metagenome assembly in general.
