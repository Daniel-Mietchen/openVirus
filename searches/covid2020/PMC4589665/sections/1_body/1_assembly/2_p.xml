<p>A comparison of the performance of standard, whole-genome shotgun DNA sequence assemblers in viral metagenomes has been published recently (Vázquez-Castellanos et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). None of the tested assemblers achieved convincing results. Whole-genome assemblers are known to perform poorly on metagenomes because they assume even coverage (Pop, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Laserson et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Peng et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lai et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Namiki et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Scholz et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). An assembler that was designed to work with uneven depth encountered in metagenomes is IDBA-UD (Peng et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and it has been tested for viral genome assembly in simulated viral metagenomes with good results (Aguirre de Cárcer et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
