<p>Other successful approaches in assembly of viral genomes from mixed samples are strategies that involve 
 <bold>iterative assembly</bold>. The genome of Bas-Congo virus that was associated with an outbreak of human cases of acute hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2009 (Grard et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), was assembled with software (PRICE) that applies iterative rounds of contig extension on paired-end reads (Ruby et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This targeted way of assembly is depending on a seed sequence, such as a read or contig that was initially identified by sequence similarity to a known virus. The seed is then extended by establishing local assemblies at both ends with the remaining reads which are merged to form a new contig. The target genome grows with each extension step. PRICE has been applied to a number of metagenome datasets, and aided, among others, in the discovery of a frequent contaminant in spin columns (Naccache et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), the identification of novel rhabdoviruses and bunyaviruses in mosquitos (Coffey et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and the assembly of a novel nidovirus from a ball python (Stenglein et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A similar, iterative assembly approach is applied by IVA (Iterative Virus Assembler, Hunt et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), developed for RNA virus genomes with uneven sequencing depth. Extension steps are carried out more conservatively than with PRICE, leading to more accurate assemblies of HIV and Influenza sequencing samples. The usefulness of IVA for metagenome and virus discovery data has yet to be shown.
