  <title>Iterative assembly</title>
 </caption>
 <p>Sequence assembly consists of searches of overlaps, alignment, and merging of sequences. Computational limitations however prohibit most assemblers to perform exhaustive overlap searches. In iterative assembly, the resulting contiguous sequences (contigs) and singletons of the initial assembly are subjected to assembly by the same or a different assembly algorithm. This process is repeated until no new contigs can be found. Iterative assembly disregards coverage information and is therefore well-suited for metagenomics samples where coverage biases might exist.</p>
