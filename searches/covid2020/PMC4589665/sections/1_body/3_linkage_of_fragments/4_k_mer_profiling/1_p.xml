<p>Differing sequence composition of the target genome compared to other genomes present in the metagenome can be used to cluster sequences by k-mer frequency profiling. 
 <bold>K-mer profiles</bold> are used in a wide range of sequence similarity searches in bioinformatics. In metagenomics, k-mer frequency profiling is applied for alignment-free similarity analyses between sequences (Sims et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Trifonov and Rabadan, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Comin et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), especially for sequence assembly, quality control (Plaza Onate et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and for taxonomic profiling and binning methods (Edwards et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Silva et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Dröge et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). There, k-mer analysis allows to overcome data analysis challenges associated with growing data volumes and short read lengths. The sensitivity of taxonomic classification for viral metagenome datasets however does not reach the 
 <italic>de facto</italic> gold standard level of tBLASTX analyses (Vázquez-Castellanos et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), especially for longer reads(Edwards et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and is, like BLAST searches, limited by the quality and comprehensiveness of the reference data set. This is especially true for taxonomic profiling methods, which analyse k-mer content in relation to a set of taxon-specific marker genes or genomes. Binning methods use k-mer profiles to cluster sequences based on similarity of their profiles and allow draft genome recovery (Dröge et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Ranking of k-mer profiles, based on their similarity to the seed contig, which is a method similar to binning, was successfully used to link fragments of two rhabdovirus genomes (Smits et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Other applications of k-mer analysis in viral metagenomes include nucleotide composition analysis, which are special cases of k-mers (1- and 2-mers) which was successfully used to infer a host for novel picorna-like viral sequences found in gut metagenomes (Kapoor et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).
