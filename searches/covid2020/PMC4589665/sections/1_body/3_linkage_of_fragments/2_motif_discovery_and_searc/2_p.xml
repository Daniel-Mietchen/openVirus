<p>If the presence of a sequence motif is not obvious, 
 <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery on a putative seed contig can be performed with motif discovery methods, e.g., with MEME (Bailey et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), given that this contig is long enough to harbor several occurrences of the motif. Matches of these motifs to other sequences then can be detected with MAST (Bailey et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A wide range of applications for motif discovery and searches are available (Das and Dai, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) which can accommodate differing data properties and individual preference.
