<p>DNA, RNA, or protein motifs with or without assigned functions are present in the genetic material of viruses (and other life forms). Sequence motifs that are potentially useful for linkage of fragments are motifs that occur several times in a single genome. These motifs can be useful for linkage of missing content, or the linkage of distinct segments. Well-known examples are the conserved motifs that act as mRNA start and poly(A)/stop site in viruses of the order 
 <italic>Mononegavirales (</italic>non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses) (Kolakofsky et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Penno et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) or motifs that act as leader sequence or transcription-regulation sequences in viruses of the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> (families 
 <italic>Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Roniviridae</italic>) (Pasternak et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). These elements are conserved in each genome, but the motifs are distinct for the different families. Other positive-strand RNA viruses synthesize subgenomic RNAs with similar or different mechanisms (Miller and Koev, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Lozano and Mart√≠nez-Salas, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) which can often be linked to the presence of conserved motifs in the genome. The existence of these sequence motifs in 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> and 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> could provide an ideal target for motif search and detection strategies for linkage of fragments. Also viruses with segmented genomes, like Influenza A, have been shown to harbor conserved sequence motifs (ElHefnawi et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
