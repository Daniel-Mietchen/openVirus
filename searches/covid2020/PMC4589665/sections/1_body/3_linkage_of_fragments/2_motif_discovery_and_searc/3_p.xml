<p>An example of this is the retrieval of a full genome of a red fox fecal rhabdovirus from feces of red foxes from Spain (Bodewes et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>) that was enabled by detection of a highly conserved junctional motif (Smits et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The occurrence of this motif in other, unassigned fragments, was used to link all fragments of the viral genome. The motif was highly specific for the red fox fecal rhabdovirus genome which suggested, given sufficiently long contigs, that motif search could be an effective method to link fragments.
