<p>Binning of coverage profiles refers to the clustering of contigs based on their read coverage, utilizing the differences in abundance of the organism within the metagenome sample. To this end, the read coverage for each contig has to be known, either by extraction of this information from the assembly or by mapping of the reads to the generated contigs. The coverage per base is calculated and contigs with a similar coverage are binned.</p>
