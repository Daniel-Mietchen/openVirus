<p>Binning of metagenomic contigs by coverage profiles is widely used in general metagenomics (Alneberg et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and can be used to recover rare bacterial species from metagenomes (Albertsen et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In viral metagenomes, coverage profile binning was used to assemble viral genomes across different human gut metagenomes avoiding the use of reference strains (Nielsen et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and to verify cross-assemblies of a novel bacteriophage present in 73% of all publicly available gut metagenomes (Dutilh et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, if amplification is applied during metagenome processing, a coverage bias can be introduced to the sequencing data (Karlsson et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Rosseel et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In such cases, coverage profile binning does not always have the desired effect of linking fragments from the same source (Smits et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Therefore, coverage profile binning can be applied in cases in which amplification is unnecessary or the introduction of a coverage bias was excluded.
