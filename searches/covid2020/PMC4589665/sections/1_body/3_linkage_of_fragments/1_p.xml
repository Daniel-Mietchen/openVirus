<p>Even after optimal or nearly-optimal assembly of a metagenome, no full viral target genome might have been recovered, because of drops in coverage or miss-assemblies that prohibit the extension of contigs to full length genomes. Or, in case of viruses with segmented genomes, segments can only be separately assembled. In these cases, additional methods are necessary to link the fragments together. This can be achieved by motif searches, coverage profile binning, kmer profiling, and other methods.</p>
