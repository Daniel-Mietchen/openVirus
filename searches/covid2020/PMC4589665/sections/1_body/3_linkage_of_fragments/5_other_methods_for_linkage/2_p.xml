<p>Another method to link fragments is to extract all information obtained from an assembly by looking at the original contig graphs (Mulyukov and Pevzner, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Information on adjacency of contigs can be found in such graphs and extracted for genome finishing. This method has successfully been applied when sequencing the gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>Rickettsia prowazekii</italic> (Nagarajan et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Contig adjacency information is especially useful if repeats exist that are longer than the read length, and contigs were split at positions where the reconstruction was ambiguous.
