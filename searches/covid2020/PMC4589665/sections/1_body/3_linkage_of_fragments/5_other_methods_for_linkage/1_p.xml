<p>If the sequence similarity of a part of the viral target genomes to sequences in the databases is low, it is sometimes still possible to apply remote homology detection methods (Kuchibhatla et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), such as PSI-BLAST and HMMER3 (Altschul, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Finn et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and profile-profile comparison (HHpred Kuchibhatla et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), HHblits (Remmert et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), FFAS (Jaroszewski et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), WebPRC (Brandt and Heringa, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). To apply remote homology detection it is necessary that the viral family of the target genome was identified, for example by the identification of a highly conserved stretch, and that sequence profiles of this families are present in the respective databases [e.g., in pFAM (Finn et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) or Uniprot (Magrane and Consortium, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>)] or can be produced from multiple sequence alignments.
