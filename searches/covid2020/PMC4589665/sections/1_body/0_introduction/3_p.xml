<p>Despite this promise, however, most new discoveries made through metagenomics in fact are viruses that belong to already known virus families as current data analysis strategies rely mostly on 
 <bold>similarity searches</bold> against annotated sequences in public databases (Woyke et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chew and Holmes, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Schmieder and Edwards, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Garcia-Garcerà et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Prachayangprecha et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Schürch et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Significant problems in characterization of full-length viral genomes from metagenomic datasets are encountered when dealing with a highly divergent new virus with no closely related genomes in public databases. Additional time-consuming experimental approaches are required to obtain full-length genome sequences (Van Leeuwen et al., 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Siegers et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). By optimally mining the metagenomic content, for example through effective assembly, k-mer frequency profiling, motif search, coverage profile binning, or other fragment linkage strategies, the likelihood, and speed of finding viral reads and the level of viral genome completeness can be increased. This also increases the number of reads for which a source can be assigned in metagenomes. An example was described by us recently (Smits et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and showed that, using BLAST searches, 27.67, 5.82, and 0.11% of all reads were identified as being from the viral target genome (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), whereas after viral 
 <bold>genome finishing</bold>, 69.52, 13.58, and 26.14% reads were tagged as belonging to the viral genome (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). At the same time, genome completeness increased from 7291, 7682, and 24,734 bases in the initial fragments, to full-length or nearly full-length genomes of 11, 15.5, and 33 kb (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). With the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> methods described here, the need for laboratory follow-up can be minimized, thereby providing the necessary information in a timely, efficient, and more cost-effective manner.
