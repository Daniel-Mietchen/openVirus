<p>Recovery of full-length genomes of novel viruses from metagenome data consists of four different steps: First, the assembly of the reads into long fragments, second, assignment of at least one contig (seed) as originating from the target virus, third, the linkage of other fragments to the seed contig to receive a draft genome and fourth, gap closing and finalizing of the draft genome to receive a full-length genome (Figure
