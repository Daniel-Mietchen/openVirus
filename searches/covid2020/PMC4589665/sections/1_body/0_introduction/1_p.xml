<p>Infectious viral diseases, both emerging, and re-emerging, pose a continuous health threat and disease burden to humans. In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of emerging virus disease outbreaks in human and animals alike with substantial health and economic impact. They are most likely related to accelerating environmental and anthropogenic changes, such as increased mobility and demographic changes, which alter the rate and nature of contact between animal and human populations. The influenza A viruses are probably the most notorious viruses which have shown their potential for repeated cross species transmission and pandemic potential (Claas et al.,

Schmallenberg virus caused an outbreak in ruminants with major impact on international trade of susceptible animals and animal products such as semen and embryos with more than 15 countries imposing restrictions on imports of live cattle from the European Union (EU) (Beer et al.,
