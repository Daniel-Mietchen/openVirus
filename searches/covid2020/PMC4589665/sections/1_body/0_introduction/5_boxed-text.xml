 <p>After metagenome assembly, genomes of individual organisms are often incomplete and shattered into different contigs. While in case of known viral genomes, the genomes can be resolved by mapping to a reference genome, in novel, and divergent viral genomes it is often necessary to link contigs first. Further steps to retrieve a full-length genome involve confirmation of linkage, augmenting assemblies, determination of the order of the contigs and closing gaps between them.</p>
