<p>Breakthroughs in the field of metagenomics have had far-reaching effects on the identification and characterization of newly emerging viral pathogens (Fauci and Morens, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Virus discovery metagenomics assays rely on sequence-independent amplification of nucleic acids from clinical samples, in combination with next-generation sequencing platforms and bioinformatics tools for sequence analysis. They are relatively simple and fast, and allow detection of hundreds of viruses simultaneously and unknown viruses even if they are highly divergent from those that are already described (Rosario and Breitbart, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Miller et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Smits and Osterhaus, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). If the new viral genome shows considerable similarity to previously characterized virus genomes present in public databases, the identification of a new virus and its genomic characterization can be finalized in a matter of days and a fraction of the costs compared to a few years ago. This is of utmost importance for timely disease outbreak management. Here, the guiding questions are: Is the group of diseased persons normal for the time of year and/or geographic area? If so, which pathogen(s) is causing the disease? Who gets infected? How do people get infected? What is the source of infection? What are transmission routes? How can infection be prevented, treated and/or contained? The fast discovery of a partial or full-length viral genome can also serve as basis for development of specific molecular diagnostic assays to confirm suspect cases and for development of vaccines and antivirals. This was exemplified after the discoveries of Schmallenberg virus and MERS Coronavirus, where molecular diagnostic protocols were made available within a matter of days after the discovery of the pathogen (Beer et al.,

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).
