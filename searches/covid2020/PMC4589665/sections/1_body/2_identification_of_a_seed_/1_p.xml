<p>After assembly it is essential to identify at least one fragment as originating from the target virus. This is most often performed by sequence similarity to known viruses, for example by BLAST analysis (Mokili et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In the absence of sequence similarity, contig length, and abundance of the fragment can be an indication for the presence of an abundant organism with a comparably short genome within the metagenome (Bellas et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Additional information gained from the sequence alone, like circularity, can also give an indication for the possible viral origin of a fragment (Mokili et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).
