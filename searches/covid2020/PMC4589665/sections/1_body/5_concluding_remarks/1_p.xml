<p>In this review, we discussed some methods for assembly and linkage of viral genomes from metagenomes. They overcome often-encountered challenges associated with the extraction of full-length viral genomes from metagenomes: no or little similarity to viral sequences in databases, uneven coverage of the target genomes, and intrapopulation diversity or sequencing errors leading to incomplete contigs.</p>
