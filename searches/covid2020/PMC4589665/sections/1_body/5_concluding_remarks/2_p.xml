 <italic>In silico</italic> genome finishing methods for recovery of a full-length viral genome from a metagenome are cost-effective and fast because they avoid re-sequencing. Selection of the most effective methods for assembly and finishing of viral genomes depends highly on the sample: host, originating tissue, library preparation, sequencing technique, and depth will lead to different methods for finishing. In general, recovery consists of four different steps (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>): assembly, identification, linkage, and finalizing. All methods are depending on the presence of sufficient sequencing data of the target genome, which in turn is related to a sufficiently high load of the viral target genome in the metagenome sample, and the quality of sample preparation and sequencing protocols in the first place. If target genome loads are not high enough, re-sequencing of the metagenome sample can be a solution, with either a complementary sequencing technique, mate-pair, or paired-end reads, or longer sequences or at a higher depth (Nagarajan et al.,
