<p>To effectively use k-mer profiles, coverage profile binning and motif search to link fragments, it is essential that long contigs (&gt;1 kb) are produced by the assembly. Coverage and k-mer profile analysis perform better on long fragments because of the noise associated with the high numbers of features in case of k-mers or introduced by uneven coverage (Smits et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Motif search is limited by occurrence of the motif, which is more likely in long contigs. Therefore, it is advisable to apply the linkage methods only to well-assembled, long fragments. Successful assembly on the other hand starts with the selection of an assembler suited for sequencing technique and read length, and, if applicable, makes use of paired-end information. By combining assemblies (thus the contigs) or assemblers (thus iterative assembly), the length of contigs can be increased. However, in order to directly recover full-length viral genomes from metagenomes, the development of efficient and dedicated metagenome assemblers that consider the characteristics of viromes and viral genomes is needed.
