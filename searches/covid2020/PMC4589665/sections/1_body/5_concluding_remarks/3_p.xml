<p>In some cases, even though the coverage of the organism is sufficient, viral genomes cannot completely be resolved 
 <italic>in silico</italic> despite exploitation of all possibilities described here. This was the case for the genome of a python nidovirus (PNV, Bodewes et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>; Smits et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) which had an unresolvable 5′ end and the PNV genome (accession nr 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="KJ935003" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">KJ935003</ext-link>) putatively lacks some genome information there. Since also results of 5′RACE PCRs were inconclusive, most likely due to fragmentation of the RNA in the original lung tissue, other options are needed to obtain the complete genome. For instance, another next-generation sequencing platform could be used to confirm the findings of the 454 data. In addition, it could be of interest to set up an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system to obtain a high titer virus stock with less background and use that as input material, like it was done for the DRV (Osterhaus et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>).
