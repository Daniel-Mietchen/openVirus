         <p>Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
            is a common infectious disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
            The patterns of aetiological pathogens differ by region and country. Special attention
            must be paid to CAP in Southeast Asia (SEA), a region facing rapid demographic transition.
            Estimates burden and aetiological patterns of CAP are essential for the clinical and
            public health management. The purposes of the study are to determine the incidence,
            aetiological pathogens, clinical pictures and risk factors of community-acquired pneumonia
            (CAP) in the Vietnamese adult population.

         <p>A prospective surveillance for hospitalised adult CAP was conducted in Khanh Hoa Province,
            Central Vietnam. All adults aged ≥15 years with lower respiratory tract infections
            (LRTI) admitted to a provincial hospital from September 2009 to August 2010 were enrolled
            in the study. Patients were classified into CAP and non-pneumonic LRTI (NPLRTI) according
            to the radiological findings. Bacterial pathogens were identified from sputum samples
            by the conventional culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 
            
            <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, 
            
            <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, and 
            
            <i>Moraxella catarrhalis</i>; 13 respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal specimens by PCR.

         <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Results</div>
         <p>Of all 367 LRTI episodes examined, 174 (47%) were CAP. Older age, the presence of
            underlying respiratory conditions, and higher index score of smoking were associated
            with CAP. The one-year estimated incidence of hospitalised adult CAP in our study
            population was 0.81 per 1,000 person years. The incidence increased considerably with
            age and was highest among the elderly. The case fatality proportion of hospitalised
            CAP patients was 9.8%. Among 286 sputum samples tested for bacterial PCR, 79 (28%)
            were positive for 
            
            <i>H</i>. 
            
            <i>influenzae</i>, and 65 (23%) were positive for 
            
            <i>S</i>. 
            
            <i>pneumoniae</i>. Among 357 samples tested for viral PCR, 73 (21%) were positive for respiratory viruses;
            influenza A (n = 32, 9%) was the most common.

         <p>The current adult CAP incidence in Vietnam was relatively low; this result was mainly
            attributed to the young age of our study population.
