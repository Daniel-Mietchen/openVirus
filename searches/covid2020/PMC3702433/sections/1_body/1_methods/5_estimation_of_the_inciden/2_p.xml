<p>Let 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>a </italic>
 </sub>denote the number of actively enrolled cases of LRTI and C
 <sub>a</sub> denote the number of actively enrolled CAP cases with chest X-ray confirmation. Let 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>d </italic>
 </sup>denote the number of cases with ICD-10 coded pneumonia in the hospital database. Amongst 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>d </italic>
 </sup>there were some cases which had been missed by the active enrolment and hence no chest X-ray was available to determine whether they attributed to the total incidence of CAP. Among those cases which were included in both

 <sub>
