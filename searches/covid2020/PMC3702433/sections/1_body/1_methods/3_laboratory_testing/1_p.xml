<p>The clinical specimens were immediately transported to the hospital laboratory. Gram staining was performed on all sputum, and the specimen quality was evaluated according to Geckler’s category [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Conventional bacterial culture was performed by trained laboratory technicians. To each of the NPS specimens, 800 μl of normal saline (NS) was added for processing; then, 140 μl of this fluid was transferred to a medium containing skim milk, tryptone, glucose, and glycerine (STGG media). Another 200 μl of the NPS-saline solution was added to viral transfer media (VTM). Residual sputum samples and VTM were stored at −80°C in the hospital laboratory and transported on ice pack to the Institute of Tropical Medicine at Nagasaki University, Japan every three months for further molecular tests. The sputum samples were tested by multiplex PCR, which is a conventional PCR with mixing three sets of pathogen specific primers to identify three typical pathogenic bacteria: 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from VTM using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction kit and tested for 13 previously described respiratory viruses: influenza A/B (FLUA, FLUB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Human adenovirus (HAdV), Human rhinovirus (HRV), Human bocavirus (HBoV), Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) type 1–4, and Human coronavirus OC43/229E (HCoV) [
