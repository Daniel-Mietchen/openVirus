<p>Evidence in several studies indicates that viral infection is an important trigger of secondary bacterial infection; previous viral infection might impair mucosal barriers in the respiratory system and make the host susceptible to bacterial infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, we have previously reported that the bacterial burden of

 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> in nasopharyngeal swabs was significantly higher in virus co-infected patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the current study, patients with single bacterial infection had a significantly longer duration prior to hospital admission compared with patients with virus infection. It is plausible that patients with single bacterial infection have had a previous viral infection, which had resolved by the time of hospitalisation.
