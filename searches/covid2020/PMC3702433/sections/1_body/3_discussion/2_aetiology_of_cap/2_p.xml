<p>Respiratory viruses were detected in 21% of adult CAP cases. This value is comparable with the results of other studies from European countries, which showed that 12â€“32% of hospitalised CAP patients were viral positive [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Influenza A and HRV are the leading pathogens of childhood acute respiratory infections, but positivity for these viruses was much lower in adults [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Although our finding could not confirm lower respiratory infection with HRV, the high prevalence of HRV detected from nasopharynx samples in adult CAP cases suggests the involvement of HRV as a cause of pneumonia [
