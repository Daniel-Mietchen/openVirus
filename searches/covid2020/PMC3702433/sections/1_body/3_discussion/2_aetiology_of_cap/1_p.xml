 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> are known to be common causes of adult CAP. Similarly, these pathogens were most frequently detected in adult patients with CAP in our study. Whereas 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> was detected in 25% of samples, which is comparable with the results of other studies showing positivity of 9 to 48% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the proportion of positivity for 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>influenza</italic>e (28%) in our study was substantially higher than previously reported: 2.7–6% in Sweden, Spain, and Thailand [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This difference may be because we used molecular techniques. There were some discrepancies between bacterial culture and PCR; more positive results were observed in PCR than culture but this tendency was compatible with previously published reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. PCR methods are known to detect pathogens even just a few days after being exposed to antibiotics, which is difficult to detect with conventional bacterial culture [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We believe that molecular techniques are more appropriate for pathogen surveys because the results are less affected by pre-exposure to antibiotics. It is generally difficult to distinguish bacteria colonised in the oral cavity from bacteria as a causative pathogen. Quality assessment of sputum samples is therefore important; Gram staining can provide supplementary information. In this study, we simultaneously performed Gram staining and assessed the quality of sputum samples. Unfortunately, obtaining good quality sputum was found to be difficult. Only 11% turned out to be 4 or 5 in Geckler’s category. The proportion of positive samples and the pattern of pathogens did not significantly differ between good quality samples and those with lower quality. Furthermore, preceding antibiotic use might have affected the sensitivity of bacterial culture results. Although the clinical specimens were collected before the administration of antibiotics in the hospital, one-fourth of the patients in our study took antibiotics purchased at a local pharmacy prior to their admission. When all of these factors are considered, careful interpretation of the aetiology results is necessary.
