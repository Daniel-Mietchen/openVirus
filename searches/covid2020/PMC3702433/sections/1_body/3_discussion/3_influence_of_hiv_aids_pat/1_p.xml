<p>We included 7 cases with known HIV infection. While some similar studies in other regions excluded immuno-suppressed patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] or restricted to previously well patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], others did not exclude these patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Our concern was that the regional variation in the prevalence of HIV infection could affect the incidence of pneumonia. However, even excluded these patients the incidence of CAP was not changed much (0.81/1,000 population-year, 95%CI 0.71-0.91). The aetiology of pneumonia amongst patients with HIV/AIDS may differ, but because of limited laboratory resource, we couldnâ€™t test for additional pathogens like 
 <italic>P</italic>.
 <italic>jirovecci</italic>, cytomegarovirus or criptococcus. In one HIV positive case, co-infection of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> and adenovirus was detected by bacterial culture and viral PCR. One single 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>influenzae</italic> infection, two single 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> infections and one co-infection with 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>influenzae</italic> were detected from bacterial PCR, and no pathogen was detected from the other 3 cases. Thus the aetiology in HIV infected cases was not apparently different from those without HIV infection.
