<p>Our study revealed that the one-year estimated incidence of hospitalised CAP among adults aged ≥15 years in Central Vietnam was 0.8 per 1,000 PY. This figure was, in fact, lower than that of similar studies with chest X-ray-confirmed pneumonia in the Western world, such as studies in the USA (patients aged &gt; 45 years: 16 per 1,000 PY vs. 1.8 per 1,000 PY in our study) [
