<p>Several factors explain this difference. First, the definition of pneumonia varies by study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Certain studies used chest X-ray findings to determine pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], whereas others used clinically defined criteria or simply relied on reported cases at the sentinel sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In our study, we carefully defined pneumonia using stringent criteria based on chest X-ray findings; with these criteria, only 45% of clinically diagnosed LRTIs exhibited consolidation on chest X-rays. Thus, our figures are conservative estimates. Second, our study targeted hospitalised CAP and did not include cases treated at the outpatient department or at neighbouring clinics. Since our hospital is only tertiary hospital in this area, there was a concern that only severe cases were admitted to this hospital. However, the proportions of mild cases with PSI classes I or II and CURB65 score 0 or 1 were similar to those reported by Capelastegui (CURB65 0–1 69.8%, incidence of CRP 3.1 per 1,000PY) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and Gutiérrez (PSI classes I and II 54.2%, incidence of CAP 1.2 per 1,000PY) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We therefore believe that a selective bias towards severe patients is not a major factor explaining the low incidence rate although we need to collect the information about health care seeking behaviour within the community to determine the actual incidence of CAP. Third, the age distribution is substantially different; the proportion of the elderly in Vietnam is lower than those in Western counties. Although the one-year estimated incidence of CAP in Spain was higher than our estimates, their age group-specific incidences were compatible with our estimates: 0.7, 1.1, 2.4, and 5.3 per 1,000 PY for the age groups of 15–44, 45–64, 65–74, and over 75 years, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This finding indicates that the relatively low one-year incidence of CAP was mainly attributable to differences in the population structures. A similar large-scale study conducted in Thailand also showed a slightly higher incidence, but that study included children under 5 years old with a very high incidence rate of pneumonia [
