<p>Our study revealed that the one-year estimated incidence of CAP was relatively low in the current adult population in Vietnam, but we showed that both the incidence and the case fatality ratio drastically increased with age and were highest among the elderly. This observation indicates that the disease burden will rapidly increase as the population gets older. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Vietnamese elderly population (persons aged ≥ 65 years) will reach 11 million (11%) in 2030, which is almost double the 2009 percentage [
