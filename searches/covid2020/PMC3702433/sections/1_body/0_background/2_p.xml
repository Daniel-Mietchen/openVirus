<p>From the clinical and public health perspectives, estimates of the overall health care burden and aetiological patterns of CAP are essential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. According to a recent systematic review, the patterns of aetiological pathogens differ by region and country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In SEA, the overuse of antibiotics may be associated with different pathogen distributions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As a result of these differences, the empirical antimicrobial therapy and vaccination (e.g., 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine) programmes recommended in Western countries may not be directly applicable to the adult population in this region. Complicating the issue, available data on the epidemiology of CAP are seriously limited in SEA countries, including Vietnam [
