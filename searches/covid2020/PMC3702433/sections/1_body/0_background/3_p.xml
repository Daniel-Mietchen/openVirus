<p>The major limitation in conducting a CAP study in resource-limited settings is the lack of sensitive diagnostic tools and standardised clinical data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The recent development of improved microbiological methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), may overcome this limitation. One of the advantages of PCR for respiratory pathogens is its ability to identify pathogens in patients who have already received antimicrobial therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Only a few studies have applied this method to the study of CAP in SEA [
