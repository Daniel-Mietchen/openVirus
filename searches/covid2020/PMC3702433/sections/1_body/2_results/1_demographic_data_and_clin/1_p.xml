<p>A total of 367 LRTI episodes were found in 359 patients who were actively enrolled in the study. Five patients had two episodes each, and one patient had four episodes. A total of 174/367 (47%) were CAP, and the rest were NPLRTI (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Median age (range) of enrolled cases, CAP and NPLRTI were 42 (15–97), 50 (15–97) and 34 (16–95) respectively. Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows a comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics by endpoints. Older age ≥ 65 years, history of tuberculosis, malnutrition and higher smoking index (e.g. number of cigarettes per day multiplied by smoking year) were associated with CAP.
