<p>A total of 323 sputum samples were obtained from actively enrolled 323 cases. Of the 289 tested by bacterial culture, 43 (15%) were positive. Of the 286 tested by PCR, 132 (46%) were positive for at least one bacterial pathogen, including 19 samples with dual infection and four with triple infection. In culture, 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>catarrhalis</italic> were the most frequently isolated, followed by 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, whereas in PCR, 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>influenzae</italic> and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> were the most frequently detected, followed by 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>catarrhalis</italic> (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). 252 samples were tested for both bacterial culture and PCR (Additional file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1). The concordance rate of these tests was 206/252 (81.7%), 190/252 (75.4%) and 238/252 (94.4%) for 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>influenzae</italic>, and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>catarrharis</italic>, respectively. The numbers of the positive PCRs with negative bacterial cultures were more than those of positive cultures with negative PCRs for all three bacteria. Overall, among 323 samples tested for either culture and/or PCR, 149 (46%) were positive for some bacterial pathogens. The patterns of isolated bacteria were similar between CAP and NPLRTI. These patterns were also similar between age groups, except that 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>aeruginosa</italic> was isolated more frequently in the elderly (p = 0.031). Blood cultures were performed for all enrolled cases; 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> was isolated in one case, and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> was isolated in two cases. According to Gram staining, only 12% (n = 24/208) of evaluated sputum samples showed acceptable quality (4 or 5 in Geckler’s category). Even among these 24 quality-assured sputum samples, only 13% (n/N = 3/24) turned out to be positive by culture, whereas approximately 52% (n/N = 11/21) were positive by PCR: 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (n = 5), 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>influenzae</italic> (n = 4), and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>catarrhalis</italic> (n = 2).
