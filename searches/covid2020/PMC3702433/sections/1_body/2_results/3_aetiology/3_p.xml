<p>In 245 cases with samples completed for both bacterial and viral tests, pathogens were identified in 151 (62%). In 26 (11%) of the cases, both virus and bacterial pathogens were detected, but there was no significant association between the detection of virus and of bacteria. HMPV, HBoV, PIV1-4, and HCoV were not detected in any of our cases. The distribution of identified pathogens in each age group is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The mean duration from onset to admission was significantly longer in cases with bacterial infection (mean ± SD: 4.2 ± 5.8 days, n = 123, p = 0.013) compared with that of cases without bacterial infection (2.7 ± 3.1 days, n = 122)
