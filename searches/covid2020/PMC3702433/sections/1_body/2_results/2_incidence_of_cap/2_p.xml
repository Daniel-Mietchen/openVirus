<p>The estimated age group-specific incidences of CAP are shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. The incidence of CAP in the elderly aged ≥ 65 years was 4.6 per 1,000 person years (PY) (95% CI: 3.8–5.5), which was ten times higher than the incidence in the younger age group; 0.48 (0.41 – 0.57). Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows sex-specific incidence rates for each age group. The incidence of CAP in females was higher than that of males for ages 45–64 years, whereas no gender difference was observed in the one-year estimated incidence for total adult population.
