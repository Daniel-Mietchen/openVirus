<p>Concerning laboratory capacity for the detection of common diseases, all countries lack capacity for diagnostics of some diseases/syndromes important for patient management and safety, and monitoring of public health programs, particularly on the regional and local level. All countries reported that laboratories serving physicians at the primary care level have insufficient technical equipment or reagents and that adequate diagnostic tests are therefore not available. In addition, in all but one country doctors do not systematically test and/or refer patients for diagnostic microbiology testing. In some countries, standard algorithms for performing laboratory testing of samples in patients presenting with common diseases/syndromes are either not available or not followed at clinical care level. All countries except one have developed algorithms for sample referral for meningitis, however only half of the countries have algorithms for sample referral for cases of diarrhea. Four countries indicated that insufficient levels of trained laboratory personnel in clinical laboratories also hamper effective use of microbiology diagnostic tests by physicians at primary level.</p>
