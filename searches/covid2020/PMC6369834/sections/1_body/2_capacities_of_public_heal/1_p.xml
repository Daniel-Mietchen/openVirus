 <italic>EU acquis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) (as per EU surveillance case definition) (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), the capacity in the Western Balkan countries ranged between 70 (37 out of 53 diseases) and 85% (45 out of 53 diseases). No country reported having full diagnostic capacity for variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, and only a few countries reported full capacity for rare and emerging diseases, such as smallpox, SARS, and yellow fever. For botulism, plague, poliomyelitis, rabies, tetanus, and yersiniosis the diagnostic capacity was limited. An overview of capacities by pathogen is displayed in
