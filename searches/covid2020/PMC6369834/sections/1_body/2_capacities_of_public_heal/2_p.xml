<p>Countries identified several key issues in the organizational set up and structures of national laboratory systems supporting public health that need to be addressed. First, national regulations and nominations of reference microbiology laboratories are often missing or ambiguous; re-assessment of the situation for re-nomination is problematic in a majority of countries. Second, resources for laboratory activity are often ineffectively allocated to e.g., screening programmes without scientific basis and tangible impact (and lacking technical collaboration with other sectors). Third, in some countries, there is no complete inventory nor a clear overview of all microbiology laboratories; only half of the countries have a national database of all available microbiology laboratories operating in the public and private sectors. Four out of six countries reported that they perform a national assessment of capacities, space, equipment, and staff. None of the countries has established an electronic laboratory data reporting system from microbiology laboratories to the public health central level. All countries reported having established cross-sectoral information exchange including exchange between laboratory and epidemiology services.</p>
