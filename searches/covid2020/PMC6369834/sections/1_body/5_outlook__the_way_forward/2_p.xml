<p>Bringing together advanced technologies in laboratory diagnostics (e.g., NGS- and/or WGS-based typing) and epidemiology raises the possibility of a digital pathogen surveillance system. In the context of the One Health approach, in which human, animal, and environmental health are considered together, such a system could have a potential to improve public health, e.g., in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity (

Thus, there is also a clear case to be made to integrate improvement of laboratory capacities and capabilities for effective pathogen detection, characterization and control into regional investment to boost One Health approach against AMR in Western Balkan countries.
