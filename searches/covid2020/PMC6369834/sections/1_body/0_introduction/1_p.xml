<p>Europe's responses to cross-border health threats from communicable diseases are dependent on strong and well-functioning health systems in the EU and in its neighbors. Investing in neighboring countries' epidemiological and laboratory capacities is key for the security of both EU citizens and their neighbors against the threat of communicable diseases. In this regard, ECDC under the EU enlargement policy contributed to national efforts of EU candidate and potential candidate countries to strengthen their communicable disease prevention and control capacities.</p>
