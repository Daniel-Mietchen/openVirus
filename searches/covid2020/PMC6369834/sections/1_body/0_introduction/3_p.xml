<p>During the 10 years of technical cooperation on communicable disease prevention and control, ECDC has supported national authorities in EU candidate and potential candidate countries to improve the capacities of microbiology laboratory systems to fulfill requirements set out by 
 <italic>EU acquis</italic> on cross-border health threats. Analysis of the current situation of microbiology laboratories supporting public health in the countries suggests that system capacities and their services to support communicable disease surveillance and response as required by the 
 <italic>EU acquis</italic> are limited. In addition, limited availability of clinical guidelines and laboratory testing algorithms for aetiological diagnosis of common infections arguably hampers efficient treatment of patients in many of these countries.
