<p>In 2013, an Observer role was established to the ECDC National Microbiology Focal Points (NMFP) forum for Western Balkan countries and Turkey representing national public health institutes, to increase awareness about the importance of public health microbiology in national communicable disease surveillance and control, thereby contributing to the preparation of these countries to participate in ECDC work. Through this initiative, ECDC supports implementation of EU acquis through exchange of best practices and EU standards for effective laboratory response to public health events and enhanced public health microbiology.</p>
