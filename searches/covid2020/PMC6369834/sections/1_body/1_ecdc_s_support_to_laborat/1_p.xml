With financial support from the European Commission under Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), ECDC has gradually supported integration of these countries into ECDC activities, including support to public health microbiology systems. Upon request from the European Commission, ECDC has also been assessing country capacities in the area of communicable disease prevention and control. ECDC reviewed countries' compliance and implementation of EU legislation and made recommendations on reforms needed to meet essential public health system requirements as part of the accession process. In this regard, one of the six assessed areas was national systems of public health microbiology laboratories.
