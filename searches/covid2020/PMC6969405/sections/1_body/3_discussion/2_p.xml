<p id="Par33">Further screening of a total of 1554 animals resulted in 439 nidovirus RNA positive animals (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). From 377 (for which information about the disease status was available) nidovirus RNA positive animals 285 showed no respiratory disease (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). In addition to the species described in previous reports, we could prove the infection in 
 <italic>Python brongersmai</italic>, 
 <italic>Bothrochilus albertisii</italic>, 
 <italic>Brothrochilus boa</italic>, 
 <italic>Morelia boeleni</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspidites melanocephalus</italic> as well as Papua pythons (
 <italic>Apodora papuana</italic>, data not shown, 2019) further expanding the viral host range. Approximately 31% of all tested pythons were positive. In spite of this, only one boa out of 128 animals revealed the presence of nidovirus genome. This is in concordance to one published study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Unfortunately, no material for sequencing was available from the infected boa. This roughly confirms the 27% positive pythons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. At least in our study, the detection of viral RNA correlates not always with clinical signs.
