<p id="Par31">We further validated the new developed real-time PCR by comparing it to the PCR used from Dervas et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In total, 60 negative and 46 positive swabs were tested using both methods. Results of our PCR were in line with the PCR developed by Dervas et al. (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). All positive samples showed comparable results with both PCRs. In two samples, results were negative in the PCR according to Dervas et al., whereas low reactions was found in our PCR assays.
