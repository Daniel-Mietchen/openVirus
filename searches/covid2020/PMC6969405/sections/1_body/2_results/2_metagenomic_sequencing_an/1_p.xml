<p id="Par26">Organ material of one green tree pythons (
 <italic>Morelia viridis</italic>) was subjected to a metagenome analysis. Thereby, a few reads with the highest overall identity to a ball python snake nidovirus were detected. Besides, reads of a retrovirus could be classified. Afterwards two other snake samples with a higher viral load were chosen for whole genome sequencing. A primer walking approach could close the gaps of the snake nidovirus sequences and thus two complete coding genomes could be generated with a sequence length of 32.88 kb and 32.75 kb respectively. The overall genome organization with eight open reading frames is similar to the other published snake nidoviruses (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Due to their origin, they were named 
 <italic>Morelia viridis</italic> snake nidovirus. These two sequences share a nucleotide identity of 99.7% to each other. The highest overall sequence similarity to published sequences appears to be 66.8 and 66.9%, respectively to a nidovirus sequence derived from a green tree python in Switzerland (MF351889 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). The overall sequence similarities to other published snake nidoviruses is between 64.8 and 65.5%. The ORF1B (part of the replicase gene) seems to be most conserved with sequence similarities on nucleotide level varying between 79.8 and 80.8% and roughly 85% on amino acid level. The most variable area is the ORF3 (glycoprotein) with nucleotide sequence similarities of 53.5–47.5% and amino acid similarities of 40.7–33.2% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). All reptile nidoviruses cluster together in the genera 
 <italic>Serpentovirinae</italic> inside the family 
 <italic>Tobaniviridae</italic> within the order Nidovirales (Fig.
