<p id="Par12">The order 
 <italic>nidovirales</italic> compromises divergent virus families with notable human and animal pathogens like for example severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The snake nidoviruses were assigned to the family 
 <italic>coronaviridae</italic> in the subfamily 
 <italic>torovirinae</italic> that covers two genera: 
 <italic>torovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>bafiniviru</italic>s infecting mammals and fish, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The reptile nidoviruses cluster together in a monophyletic clade and a new genus for these unassigned viruses was proposed: 
 <italic>barnivirus</italic> (bacilliform reptile nidovirus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Last year the ICTV changed the taxonomy of the order 
 <italic>nidovirales</italic> from four to seven suborders. The subfamily 
 <italic>torovirina</italic>e, based on molecular properties, is now no longer part of the 
 <italic>coronaviridae</italic>, but belongs instead to a suborder called 
 <italic>tornidovirineae</italic> in a new family called 
 <italic>tobaniviridae</italic>. Within this family, the subfamily 
 <italic>Serpentovirinae</italic> compromises in the genus 
 <italic>Roypretovirus</italic> the ball python nidovirus (ICTV, 2018).
