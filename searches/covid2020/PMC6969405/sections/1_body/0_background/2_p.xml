<p id="Par11">In 2014, three working groups described contemporaneous using unbiased deep sequencing a new nidovirus in captive pythons suffering from pneumonia. The first report from the USA investigated material from eight deceased ball pythons (
 <italic>Python regius</italic>) with a pneumonia. By deep sequencing, they were able to obtain a complete coding genome of a novel nidovirus. As a control, organ materials of 57 snakes, mostly colubrid, with clinical signs other than respiratory diseases were tested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The other study from the USA focused as well on ball pythons. There, 12 snakes suffering from pneumonia, tracheitis and esophagitis were examined and were subjected to a metagenomic workflow and partial sequences from a novel nidovirus were derived [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The third study described the results from a diagnostic workup of an Indian python (
 <italic>Python molurus</italic>) diagnosed with severe necrotizing pneumonia from a zoological garden in northern Germany. Again, unbiased sequencing resulted in the complete coding genome sequence of a novel nidovirus, which could not be detected in ten healthy boas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. After that, a working group from Switzerland detected a nidovirus in different captive breeding colonies of green tree pythons (
 <italic>Morelia viridis</italic>). Twelve deceased animals with pneumonia were investigated and this virus shared only &lt; 85% sequence similarity to the previous published sequences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Marschang and Kolesnik detected the virus not only in deceased animals, but also in swab samples from living animals. Out of the 201 examined animals, 30 were RNA positive. The animals originated from different parts of Europe and positive animals included 
 <italic>Python regius</italic>, 
 <italic>Python molurus</italic>, 
 <italic>Morelia viridis</italic>, 
 <italic>Morelia spilota</italic> and 
 <italic>Boa constrictor</italic>. Pythons (27.4%) were more affected than boas (2.4%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In Italy the virus was detected in six tracheobronchial lavages from diseased ball pythons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A working group in the USA fulfilled Koch’s postulates in 2018, which showed a causal relationship between the novel snake nidovirus and pneumonia in ball pythons by experimentally infection of three animals. The observed clinical signs covered oral mucosal redding, mucous secretions, open-mouth breathing and anorexia. Histologic examinations showed rhinitis, stomatitis, tracheitis, esophageitis and interstitial pneumonia. The virus was present in oral secretions as well as in feces, suggesting either transmission by aerosolization or by the fecal-oral route [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Besides these reports from snakes, nidoviruses were also found in other reptiles like turtles and lizards in the last years. In lizards, they have been proven in animals with and without clinical signs. In turtles, the virus was found only once in diseased animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
