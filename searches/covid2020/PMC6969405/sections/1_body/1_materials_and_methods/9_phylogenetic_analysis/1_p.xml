<p id="Par24">The newly generated sequences of two full-length snake nidoviruses were aligned to each other as well as to further complete coding genome sequences from different members of the subfamily 
 <italic>Tobaniviridae</italic> obtained from GenBank using the method MAFFT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] as implemented in the Geneious software (version 10.2.1). Furthermore, the 36 partial ORF1AB sequences were aligned to each other and to other full-length snake nidovirus genomes. Based on these alignments, maximum-likelihood trees (PhyML) were calculated using the HKY85 model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] with 1000 bootstrap replicates by the Geneious software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].
