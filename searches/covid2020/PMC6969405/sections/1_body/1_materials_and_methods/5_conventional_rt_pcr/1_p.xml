<p id="Par20">In order to find specific primers for one published ball python nidovirus (KJ541759) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] the primer designed tool Primer-BLAST was used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Three different primer pairs were tested. The RT-PCR was done with the One step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and uses a forward primer (5’CAA CTC TGC ACA AAC GCG AA 3′) and a reverse primer (5’CGG CGA TCT TGA TGT TGC TG 3′) amplifying a PCR product of approximately 300 bp. The temperature profile consists of a reverse transcription step at 50 °C for 45 min, an activation step at 94 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 45 s as well as a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were visualized by electrophoreses on an agarose gel.
