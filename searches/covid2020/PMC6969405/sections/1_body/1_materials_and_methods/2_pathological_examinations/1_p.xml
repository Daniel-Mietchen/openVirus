<p id="Par17">Nine green tree snakes were sent for necropsy. Diagnostic workup in the chemical and veterinary investigation office included a gross pathology, histopathology, virology and bacteriology. Necropsy and following investigations have been carried out using standard techniques. In short, after pathological examination of the carcasses tissues were fixed in formalin and stained with Haematoxylin-Eosin. The tissues were evaluated microscopically. All snakes were investigated virologically. Suspensions of liver, lung, kidney and intestine were inoculated bacteria-free into Viper Heart Cells at 29 °C (ATCC CCL 140) and incubated for 1 week. Supernatant was transferred to a new cell culture and incubated for another week. Cells were inspected daily for the presence of cytopathic effects. PCRs for paramyxovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], for reovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], for reptarenavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], ranavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and for adenovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] were performed with organ tissues and cell culture supernatant. Bacteriological investigations from liver, kidney and lung were carried out in five snakes onto blood agar, incubated at 30 °C. Isolated bacteria were typed using MALDI TOF.
