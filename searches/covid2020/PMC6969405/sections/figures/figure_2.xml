 <caption>
  <p>Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of previously published and newly identified reptile nidoviruses within the subfamily 
   <italic>Serpentovirinae</italic>. The tree is based on a 882â€‰bp long nucleotide sequence in the ORF1B coding for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Statistical support for nodes was obtained by bootstrapping (1000 replicates). Accession numbers are indicated after the respective sequence. The sequences are derived from different species: Bellinger River snapping turtle (black), green tree python (green), carpet python (orange), diamond python (red), ball python (blue), indian python (purple) and white-lipped python (grey). Full-length sequences are marked in bold and all newly generated sequences are markes with a red star
