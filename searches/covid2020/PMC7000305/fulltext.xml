This has directed the development of stringent screening criteria that has been implemented in different health care systems in Saudi Arabia; including Ministry of Health hospitals. A suspected case which defined as an instance of admission to a health care facility with any clinical symptoms that suggest infection or a history of contact with established cases, will trigger a laboratory MERS-CoV testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for MERS-CoV in swab samples collected at admission (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Aleanizy et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">Although, many studies have suggested the prognosis of confirmed MERS-Cov and the contribution of underlying comorbidities on the severity of the disease, yet no studies have highlighted the characteristics of those who tested positive with RT-PCR test among suspected cases, especially the contribution of medications.

As reported on smaller studies, age, male sex and comorbidities are likely to be associated with the infection (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Aleanizy et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Guery et al., 2013</xref>). Other variables are less likely to suggest MERS infection. In term of medication history, of the analyzed sample we found no statical differences that suggest increase or decrease the likelihood of the MERS infection, however, all subjects on received DiPeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors tested negative which may suggest an underlying mechanism that prevents the transmission of the virus. Other medications include metformin, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) nor beta blockers are associated with an increase or decrease in the likelihood of the MESRA infection.</p><p id="p0050">Like other studies that suggested that MERS infection is predominance in male, we found a statistical association that confirmed this (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Aleanizy et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Guery et al., 2013</xref>). Although, our study has a large female representation in our sample and which can be due to the likelihood of the sharp increase in health care workers- which likely to be female, screening upon exposure to a patient with a possible history of MERS infection. The other reason is many health care institutions became very strict with screening and testing any suspected cases to prevent MERS infection outbreaks which increase the female detection. Our study suggests that gender difference is associated with an increase in the likelihood of MERS infection. Also, our study suggests diabetic patient are more likely to have a confirmed MERS infection compared to nondiabetic patients which have been also reported previously in the literature (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Zumla et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">One of the unique sides of our study is to look at the impact of medications on MERS infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at the association of patient&#x02019;s medication history and the risk of infection. We found that many medications include those for chronic diseases are not associated with the increase or decrease the likelihood of MERS infection. Although many diabetic patients were on metformin, our analysis shows that it has no effect on MERS infection. Similarly, sulfonylureas were not associated with an increase or decrease in the likelihood of the infection. Of the diabetic medication, patient on DDP-4 inhibitors was less likely to have MERS infection. The entry receptor for MERS-CoV was identified as a dipeptidyl peptidase receptor. DDP-4 is expressed on the surface of human airway and the blockage of this enzyme may interfere with the virus transmission.</p><p id="p0060">In a similar study looked at the demographics of patients with MERS infection, many studies suggested that the infection is more common in patients with comorbidities, primarily diabetes, and chronic kidney diseases. Moreover, the severity of the infection and the increased risk of mortality is likely with older patients and patients with diabetes and chronic kidney diseases. These findings suggest the benefit of screening suspected infection and may suggest future preventive therapy.</p><p id="p0065">The limitations of this study include the following. First, there were some missing data on some demographics data which limit the analysis to draw a better understanding of the infection. Second, this was a retrospective analysis which has an inherited flow by its nature. Finally, the outcome of infection and the severity of disease were not reported in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0070">MERS-Cov infection is more common in male, advanced age and diabetes. No medications were associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection, except for the DPP-4 inhibitors that have shown a less likely to have MERS infection. This is important to focus on screening and detection to this patient population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0075">The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest withrespect to the research, authorship, and publication of this article.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aleanizy</surname><given-names>Fadilah Sfouq</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohmed</surname><given-names>Nahla</given-names></name><name><surname>Alqahtani</surname><given-names>Fulwah Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohamed</surname><given-names>Rania Ali El Hadi</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Saudi Arabia: a retrospective study</article-title><source>BMC Infect.
