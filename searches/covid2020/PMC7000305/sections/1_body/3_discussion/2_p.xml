<p id="p0045">In this study, we evaluated the characteristics of confirmed MERS infection. As reported on smaller studies, age, male sex and comorbidities are likely to be associated with the infection (

 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Guery et al., 2013</xref>). Other variables are less likely to suggest MERS infection. In term of medication history, of the analyzed sample we found no statical differences that suggest increase or decrease the likelihood of the MERS infection, however, all subjects on received DiPeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors tested negative which may suggest an underlying mechanism that prevents the transmission of the virus. Other medications include metformin, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) nor beta blockers are associated with an increase or decrease in the likelihood of the MESRA infection.
