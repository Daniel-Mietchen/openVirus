<p id="p0055">One of the unique sides of our study is to look at the impact of medications on MERS infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at the association of patientâ€™s medication history and the risk of infection. We found that many medications include those for chronic diseases are not associated with the increase or decrease the likelihood of MERS infection. Although many diabetic patients were on metformin, our analysis shows that it has no effect on MERS infection. Similarly, sulfonylureas were not associated with an increase or decrease in the likelihood of the infection. Of the diabetic medication, patient on DDP-4 inhibitors was less likely to have MERS infection. The entry receptor for MERS-CoV was identified as a dipeptidyl peptidase receptor. DDP-4 is expressed on the surface of human airway and the blockage of this enzyme may interfere with the virus transmission.</p>
