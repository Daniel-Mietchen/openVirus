<p id="Par47">To contain the transmission of the virus, it is important to decrease 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. According to the equation of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> deduced from the simplified RP model, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is related to many parameters. The mainly parameters which could be changed were 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>P</italic>
 </sub>, 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>W</italic>
 </sub>, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>. Interventions such as wearing masks and increasing social distance could decrease the 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>P</italic>
 </sub>, the intervention that close the seafood market could decrease the 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>W</italic>
 </sub>, and shorten the duration form symptoms onset to be diagnosed could decrease 1/
 <italic>γ</italic>. All these interventions could decrease the effective reproduction number and finally be helpful to control the transmission.
