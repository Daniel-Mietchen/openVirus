<p id="Par46">Researches showed that the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was about 2.7–3.4 or 2–4 in Hong Kong, China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Another research found that the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of SARS was about 2.1 in Hong Kong, China, 2.7 in Singapore, and 3.8 in Beijing, China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, we believe that the commonly acceptable average value of the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of SARS might be 2.9 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The transmissibility of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is much lower than SARS. The reported value of the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of MERS was about 0.8–1.3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], with the inter-human transmissibility of the disease was about 0.6 or 0.9 in Middle East countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, MERS had a high transmissibility in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea with the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of 2.5–7.2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 might be higher than MERS in the Middle East countries, similar to SARS, but lower than MERS transmitted in the Republic of Korea.
