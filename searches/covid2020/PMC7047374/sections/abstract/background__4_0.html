         <p id="Par1">As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was
            identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese
            authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome
            coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11
            February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the
            transmissibility of the virus.

         <p id="Par2">In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model
            for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats)
            to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore
            clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood
            Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People
            (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to
            calculate the basic reproduction number (
            
            <i>R</i>
            <sub>0</sub>) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2.

         <p id="Par3">The value of 
            
            <i>R</i>
            <sub>0</sub> was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which
            means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing
            a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58.

         <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Conclusions</div>
         <p id="Par4">Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle
            East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory
            syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea.
