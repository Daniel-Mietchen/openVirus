The MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein mediates viral entry into target cells. For this, MERS-CoV S engages the host cell protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) and the interface between MERS-CoV S and DPP4 has been resolved on the atomic level. Here, we asked whether naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4, that alter amino acid residues required for MERS-CoV S binding, influence cellular entry of MERS-CoV. By screening of public databases, we identified fourteen such polymorphisms. Introduction of the respective mutations into DPP4 revealed that all except one (&#x00394;346-348) were compatible with robust DPP4 expression. Four polymorphisms (K267E, K267N, A291P and &#x00394;346-348) strongly reduced binding of MERS-CoV S to DPP4 and S protein-driven host cell entry, as determined using soluble S protein and S protein bearing rhabdoviral vectors, respectively. Two polymorphisms (K267E and A291P) were analyzed in the context of authentic MERS-CoV and were found to attenuate viral replication. Collectively, we identified naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4 that negatively impact cellular entry of MERS-CoV and might thus modulate MERS development in infected patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus</kwd><kwd>spike glycoprotein</kwd><kwd>dipeptidyl peptidase 4</kwd><kwd>polymorphisms</kwd><kwd>receptor binding</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung, network project RAPID (Risikobewertung bei pr&#x000e4;pandemischen respiratorischen Infektionserkrankungen&#x000a0;)</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100002347</named-content></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported, including the efforts of Stefan P&#x000f6;hlmann and Christian Drosten, by the Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung [grant numbers 01KI1723D and 01KI1723A], network project RAPID (Risikobewertung bei pr&#x000e4;pandemischen respiratorischen Infektionserkrankungen).

It belongs to the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family (genus <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>), which is part of the order <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. MERS-CoV was isolated in 2012 from the sputum of a 60 year old man suffering from acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since its discovery, MERS-CoV has caused 2,442 human infections of which 842 (34.5%) had a fatal outcome (as of May, 2019) [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Dromedary camels are reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV and display only common cold-like symptoms upon infection but constitute the main source of human infections. Transmission to humans occurs via close contact to animals or contaminated animal products [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref>]. Human-to-human transmissions seem limited and were mainly observed in health care settings, leading to MERS outbreaks in hospitals [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;12</xref>]. Finally, differences in the tissue specific expression of the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV, DPP4, were recently suggested to account for the differences in MERS-CoV transmission and disease induction in camels and humans, respectively [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In order to infect a host (cell) and replicate, MERS-CoV has to deliver its genome into the cellular cytoplasm for gene translation and genome replication. This process is facilitated by the viral spike (S) glycoprotein, a type-I transmembrane protein embedded in the viral envelope. For host cell entry, the surface unit, S1, of MERS-CoV S binds to the cellular type-II transmembrane protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The structure of the interface between DPP4 and MERS-CoV-S was resolved on the atomic level and fifteen residues in DPP4 were found to make direct contact with residues in the viral S protein [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Upon DPP4 engagement, MERS-CoV S undergoes proteolytic activation through the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 or the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref>], which allows the transmembrane unit, S2, of MERS-CoV S to fuse the viral membrane with cellular membranes.</p><p>DPP4 is a prolyl oligopeptidase that is expressed in various tissues [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and involved in multiple biological processes including T-cell activation [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], control of the activity of growth factors, chemokines and bioactive peptides [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref>], and regulation of the glucose metabolism [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Mature DPP4 is embedded in the plasma membrane as a homodimer and each monomer consists of an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a large ectodomain, which can be further subdivided into a short stalk domain, a glycosylation-rich and a cysteine-rich region as well as the C-terminal catalytic domain (&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-hydrolase domain) [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Polymorphisms in the DPP4 gene were implicated in several diseases and conditions, including diabetes [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and myocardial infarction [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] but their potential impact on MERS-CoV infection has not been analyzed.</p><p>We asked whether naturally-occurring amino acid polymorphisms in DPP4 residues making contact with MERS-CoV S have an impact on MERS-CoV entry. We identified fourteen polymorphisms by screening public databases and introduced the respective mutations into a DPP4 expression plasmid. We identified four mutations that reduced MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4 and MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry without affecting DPP4 expression at the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="S002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S002-S2001"><title>Analysis of total DPP4 expression by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot</title><p>293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for WT or mutant DPP4, or empty expression vector (negative control).

For this, we used soluble MERS-CoV S, produced by fusing the S1 subunit, which contains the DPP4 binding domain, to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G (solMERS-S1-Fc). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that DPP4 variants harboring polymorphisms K267E, K267N or A291P, which were not compatible with efficient MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry, displayed significantly reduced ability to interact with MERS-CoV S as indicated by weaker DPP4 signals upon protein A-sepharose-mediated pull-down of DPP4/solMERS-S1-Fc (as compared to DPP4 WT, <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A-B). Notably, DPP4 variant &#x00394;346&#x02013;348 could be as efficiently co-immunoprecipitated as DPP4 WT, indicating that its inefficient receptor function was solely due to its defect in proper surface transport. The findings obtained by co-IP analysis were confirmed by flow cytometry. It was revealed that polymorphisms that reduced MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry (K267E, K267N, A291P and &#x00394;346&#x02013;348) and spread of authentic MERS-CoV (K267E and A291P) also reduced MERS-CoV S binding to cells expressing DPP4 on the cell surface (<xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). In addition, polymorphism A289V, which decreased MERS-CoV S-driven transduction to a lesser extent than the aforementioned polymorphisms (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), also reduced MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4.

Presented are the mean data from three independent experiments. Error bars indicate the SEM. Statistical significance of differences in MERS-CoV S/DPP4 interaction between WT and mutant DPP4 was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett&#x02019;s posttest (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05, ns; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05, *; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.001, ***). (C) Soluble MERS-CoV S1-Fc was incubated with BHK-21 cells expressing wildtype (WT) or mutant DPP4, or cells transfected with empty expression vector or an ACE2-expression plasmid (controls). To detect bound S protein, the cells were subsequently incubated with an AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-human antibody directed against the Fc-tag. Fluorescent signals representing bound solMERS-S1-Fc were analyzed by flow cytometry and MFI values for each sample were calculated. For normalization, the MFI value of the negative control (empty expression vector) was subtracted from all samples. Further, binding of solMERS-S1-Fc to cells expressing DPP4 WT was set as 100% and the relative binding to cells expressing the DPP4 mutants was calculated accordingly. Shown are the combined data of five independent experiments with error bars indicating the SEM. Statistical significance of differences in solMERS-S1-Fc binding to cells expressing WT or mutant DPP4 was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett&#x02019;s posttest (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05, ns; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05, *; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.01, **; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.001, ***).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="TEMI_A_1713705_F0006_OC"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="S004"><title>Discussion</title><p>Host cell entry of MERS-CoV critically depends on the interaction between the viral S protein and the cellular receptor DPP4. A link between obesity or underlying diseases like diabetes mellitus, which both can affect DPP4 expression levels [<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and the risk of fatal outcome of MERS-CoV infection has been made [<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Moreover, alanine scanning mutagenesis identified DPP4 residues critical for MERS-CoV entry, including K267, L294, I295, R317 and R336 [<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, the impact of natural-occurring variations on host cell entry of MERS-CoV has not been addressed so far. We identified DPP4 polymorphisms that reduce S protein-driven host cell entry and replication of authentic MERS-CoV by lowering the binding efficiency of MERS-CoV S to DPP4, suggesting that the DPP4 phenotype may impact the course of MERS-CoV infection.</p><p>Western blot analysis, flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that none of the polymorphisms studied, except deletion of amino acids 346&#x02013;348, had a significant impact on total or cell surface expression of DPP4, at least in the context of DPP4 transfected cells. Four polymorphisms located at three different sites in DPP4 (K267E, K267N, A291P and &#x00394;346&#x02013;348) severely reduced S protein-driven host cell entry. As DPP4 &#x00394;346&#x02013;348 was shown to be incompatible with robust cell surface transport but able to interact with MERS-CoV S in co-IP analysis, we conclude that the reduction in entry efficiency is solely due to insufficient DPP4 surface levels. In contrast, reduction of host cell entry by K267E, K267N and A291P could not be explained by reduced DPP4 expression and these polymorphisms were thus further investigated. MERS-CoV infection of BHK-21 cells transfected to express DPP4 WT and variants K267E or A291P revealed that K267E or A291P were not compatible with robust MERS-CoV replication. Finally, co-IP analyses and binding studies with soluble MERS-CoV S showed that these DPP4 polymorphisms reduced S protein binding to DPP4.</p><p>When looking at the crystal structure of the complex consisting of the MERS-CoV S receptor binding domain bound to DPP4, these observations do not come as a surprise. DPP4 residue K267 has been reported to contact MERS-CoV S residues G538 and D539, including a salt bridge interaction with D539 [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The exchange of K267 to either glutamate (E) or asparagine (N) likely abolishes/decreases the interaction with MERS-S due to the different biochemical properties of K267 (positively charged, basic) versus E267 (negatively charged, acidic) and N267 (not charged, acidic) (Supplementary Figure 1). For DPP4 residue A291, which has been reported to contact the MERS-CoV S residue E513, no information on the type of interaction is available [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, we speculate that the bulky and distorted side chain of proline (in comparison to the small side chain of alanine) abolishes/decreases interaction with MERS-CoV S residue E513 (Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast to that, valine contains a small side chain and also has identical biochemical properties as alanine and thus might be efficiently contacted by E513 of MERS-CoV S, which is why we did not observe any impact of polymorphisms A291V on MERS-CoV S-driven entry and MERS-CoV S MERS-CoV S binding/interaction (Supplementary Figure 1).</p><p>The observation that certain polymorphisms in DPP4 reduced MERS-CoV S binding and viral entry triggered the question whether residues in MERS-CoV S that are in direct contact with the respective DPP4 residues are also polymorphic. Indeed, we obtained initial evidence to support such a concept. Thus, we found that residue 539 in MERS-CoV S which contacts DPP4 residue 267 is polymorphic, with certain MERS-CoV variants harboring an asparagine instead of an aspartate residue at this position. D539N reduced entry into cells expressing relatively low amounts of DPP4 but had no effect on entry into cells expressing high amounts of DPP4 (Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, and more interestingly, D539N slightly rescued MERS-CoV S-driven entry from the negative effect exerted by DPP4 polymorphism K267N (Supplementary Figure 2). Similarly, residue 510 in MERS-CoV S, which is known to interact with DPP4 residues 317 and 322, was found to be polymorphic, and previous studies demonstrated that polymorphism D510G reduced DPP4 binding but also increased resistance to neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Notably, D510G slightly increased entry via DPP4 harboring polymorphism Y322H and allowed MERS-CoV S to use DPP4 with polymorphism R317K with the same efficiency as WT DPP4. It should be stated that none of these effects was statistically significant and that DPP4 and MERS-CoV S polymorphisms occur with low frequency. Although it is unlikely that the DPP4 polymorphisms have emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure from MERS-CoV infections, our results suggest that certain existing DPP4 polymorphism(s) might foster the emergence of MERS-CoV variants with altered biological properties.</p><p>The polymorphisms studied here occur with relatively low frequencies of one per &#x0223c;19,000 (A289V) to &#x0223c;245,000 (T288I) individuals. However, detailed information on the geographic distribution or incidence in certain ethnical groups is largely missing. Thus, DPP4 polymorphisms could contribute to the perplexing absence of MERS cases in Africa, where the virus circulates in camels [<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52&#x02013;57</xref>]. However, recent evidence suggests that sequence variations between African and Arabian MERS-CoV might be a factor [<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. More importantly, it remains to be analyzed how frequent DPP4 polymorphisms that affect S protein binding occur in the Middle East and whether they are associated with the clinical course of MERS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM6840"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="TEMI_A_1713705_SM6840.zip" orientation="portrait" id="d37e268" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to thank G.
