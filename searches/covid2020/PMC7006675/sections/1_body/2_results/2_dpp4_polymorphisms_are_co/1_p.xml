<p>We next introduced the polymorphisms in a DPP4 expression plasmid. Western blot analysis and signal quantification revealed that all resulting DPP4 variants were robustly expressed and total expression levels were comparable (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A-B). As DPP4 needs to be transported to the plasma membrane to be engaged by MERS-CoV S for host cell entry, we next investigated whether the presence of the polymorphic DPP4 residues has an impact on DPP4 cell surface localization. For this, we performed flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy, using transfected BHK-21 cells and an antibody targeting the DPP4 ectodomain. We found that all DPP4 variants but one, a deletion variant lacking amino acid residues 346–348 (Δ346–348), displayed comparable cell surface expression levels (
