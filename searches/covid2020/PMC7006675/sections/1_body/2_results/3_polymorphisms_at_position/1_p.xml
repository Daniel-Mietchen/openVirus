<p>We next investigated whether polymorphic DPP4 residues impact MERS-CoV host cell entry. For this, we made use of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes (VSVpp) bearing MERS-CoV S or VSV G, which does not bind to DPP4 and served as negative control [
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. As expected, VSVpp harboring VSV G were able to efficiently transduce BHK-21 target cells irrespective of DPP4 expression. In contrast, transduction of BHK-21 cells mediated by MERS-CoV S critically depended on ectopic expression of human DPP4, in accordance with published findings [

 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Notably, four DPP4 polymorphisms - K267E, K267N, A291P and Δ346–348 - severely reduced MERS-CoV S-driven transduction compared to DPP4 WT (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In order to analyze whether the reduction in MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry would translate into attenuated MERS-CoV replication, we next investigated two DPP4 polymorphisms (K267E and A291P) in the context of infection with authentic MERS-CoV. When followed over a period of two days post infection it was observed that MERS-CoV replication in BHK-21 cells expressing human DPP4 was significantly reduced when DPP4 contained either K267E or A291P (
