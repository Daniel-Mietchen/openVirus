<p>In order to identify polymorphic residues in DPP4 that contact MERS-CoV S, we screened public databases that provide information on polymorphic amino acid residues based on data derived from different bio projects (i.e. gnomAD, TOPMed, ExAC, 1000G; more information is given in the Materials and Methods section). By this method we found that nine out of the fifteen DPP4 residues interacting with MERS-CoV S are polymorphic (K267, Q286, T288, A289, A291, R317, Y322, I346 and K392) (

While five of these residues can be replaced by only a single different amino acid residue (Q286[K], A289[V], R317[K], Y322[H] and K392[N]) the remaining four residues can be replaced by two different amino acid residues (K267[E/N], T288[I/S], A291[P/V] and I346[T/V]) or can even be absent from DPP4 (I346Î”) (
