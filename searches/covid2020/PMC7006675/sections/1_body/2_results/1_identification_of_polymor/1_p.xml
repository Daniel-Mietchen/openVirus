<p>The binding interface between MERS-CoV S and the cellular receptor DPP4 was resolved by Wang and colleagues using crystallography, revealing the interacting amino acid residues for each binding partner [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]: Fourteen residues of MERS-CoV S (Y499, N501, K502, L506, D510, R511, E513, D537 G538, D539, Y540, R542, W553 and V555) interact with a total of fifteen residues in DPP4 (K267, F269, Q286, T288, A289, A291, L294, I295, H298, R317, Y322, R336, Q344, I346 and K392) [
