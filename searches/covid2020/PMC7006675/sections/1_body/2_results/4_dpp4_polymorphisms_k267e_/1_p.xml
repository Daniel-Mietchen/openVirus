<p>After the identification of DPP4 polymorphisms that reduce S-driven cellular entry of rhabdoviral vectors as well as MERS-CoV replication, we next sought to investigate whether the attenuating phenotype was due to reduced binding of MERS-CoV S to DPP4. For this, we used soluble MERS-CoV S, produced by fusing the S1 subunit, which contains the DPP4 binding domain, to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G (solMERS-S1-Fc). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that DPP4 variants harboring polymorphisms K267E, K267N or A291P, which were not compatible with efficient MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry, displayed significantly reduced ability to interact with MERS-CoV S as indicated by weaker DPP4 signals upon protein A-sepharose-mediated pull-down of DPP4/solMERS-S1-Fc (as compared to DPP4 WT,

Notably, DPP4 variant Δ346–348 could be as efficiently co-immunoprecipitated as DPP4 WT, indicating that its inefficient receptor function was solely due to its defect in proper surface transport. The findings obtained by co-IP analysis were confirmed by flow cytometry. It was revealed that polymorphisms that reduced MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry (K267E, K267N, A291P and Δ346–348) and spread of authentic MERS-CoV (K267E and A291P) also reduced MERS-CoV S binding to cells expressing DPP4 on the cell surface (

 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), also reduced MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4. Thus, DPP4 polymorphisms K267E, K267N and A291P reduce MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry and MERS-CoV infection by diminishing MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4.
