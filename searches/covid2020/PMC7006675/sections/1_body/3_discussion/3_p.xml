<p>When looking at the crystal structure of the complex consisting of the MERS-CoV S receptor binding domain bound to DPP4, these observations do not come as a surprise. DPP4 residue K267 has been reported to contact MERS-CoV S residues G538 and D539, including a salt bridge interaction with D539 [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The exchange of K267 to either glutamate (E) or asparagine (N) likely abolishes/decreases the interaction with MERS-S due to the different biochemical properties of K267 (positively charged, basic) versus E267 (negatively charged, acidic) and N267 (not charged, acidic) (Supplementary Figure 1). For DPP4 residue A291, which has been reported to contact the MERS-CoV S residue E513, no information on the type of interaction is available [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, we speculate that the bulky and distorted side chain of proline (in comparison to the small side chain of alanine) abolishes/decreases interaction with MERS-CoV S residue E513 (Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast to that, valine contains a small side chain and also has identical biochemical properties as alanine and thus might be efficiently contacted by E513 of MERS-CoV S, which is why we did not observe any impact of polymorphisms A291V on MERS-CoV S-driven entry and MERS-CoV S MERS-CoV S binding/interaction (Supplementary Figure 1).
