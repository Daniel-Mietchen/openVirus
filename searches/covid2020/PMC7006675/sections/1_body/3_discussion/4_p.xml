<p>The observation that certain polymorphisms in DPP4 reduced MERS-CoV S binding and viral entry triggered the question whether residues in MERS-CoV S that are in direct contact with the respective DPP4 residues are also polymorphic. Indeed, we obtained initial evidence to support such a concept. Thus, we found that residue 539 in MERS-CoV S which contacts DPP4 residue 267 is polymorphic, with certain MERS-CoV variants harboring an asparagine instead of an aspartate residue at this position. D539N reduced entry into cells expressing relatively low amounts of DPP4 but had no effect on entry into cells expressing high amounts of DPP4 (Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, and more interestingly, D539N slightly rescued MERS-CoV S-driven entry from the negative effect exerted by DPP4 polymorphism K267N (Supplementary Figure 2). Similarly, residue 510 in MERS-CoV S, which is known to interact with DPP4 residues 317 and 322, was found to be polymorphic, and previous studies demonstrated that polymorphism D510G reduced DPP4 binding but also increased resistance to neutralizing antibodies [

Notably, D510G slightly increased entry via DPP4 harboring polymorphism Y322H and allowed MERS-CoV S to use DPP4 with polymorphism R317K with the same efficiency as WT DPP4. It should be stated that none of these effects was statistically significant and that DPP4 and MERS-CoV S polymorphisms occur with low frequency. Although it is unlikely that the DPP4 polymorphisms have emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure from MERS-CoV infections, our results suggest that certain existing DPP4 polymorphism(s) might foster the emergence of MERS-CoV variants with altered biological properties.
