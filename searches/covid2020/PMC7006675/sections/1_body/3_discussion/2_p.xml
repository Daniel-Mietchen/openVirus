<p>Western blot analysis, flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that none of the polymorphisms studied, except deletion of amino acids 346–348, had a significant impact on total or cell surface expression of DPP4, at least in the context of DPP4 transfected cells. Four polymorphisms located at three different sites in DPP4 (K267E, K267N, A291P and Δ346–348) severely reduced S protein-driven host cell entry. As DPP4 Δ346–348 was shown to be incompatible with robust cell surface transport but able to interact with MERS-CoV S in co-IP analysis, we conclude that the reduction in entry efficiency is solely due to insufficient DPP4 surface levels. In contrast, reduction of host cell entry by K267E, K267N and A291P could not be explained by reduced DPP4 expression and these polymorphisms were thus further investigated. MERS-CoV infection of BHK-21 cells transfected to express DPP4 WT and variants K267E or A291P revealed that K267E or A291P were not compatible with robust MERS-CoV replication. Finally, co-IP analyses and binding studies with soluble MERS-CoV S showed that these DPP4 polymorphisms reduced S protein binding to DPP4.</p>
