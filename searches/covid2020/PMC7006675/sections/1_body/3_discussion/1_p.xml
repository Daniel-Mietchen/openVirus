<p>Host cell entry of MERS-CoV critically depends on the interaction between the viral S protein and the cellular receptor DPP4. A link between obesity or underlying diseases like diabetes mellitus, which both can affect DPP4 expression levels [
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and the risk of fatal outcome of MERS-CoV infection has been made [
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Moreover, alanine scanning mutagenesis identified DPP4 residues critical for MERS-CoV entry, including K267, L294, I295, R317 and R336 [
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, the impact of natural-occurring variations on host cell entry of MERS-CoV has not been addressed so far. We identified DPP4 polymorphisms that reduce S protein-driven host cell entry and replication of authentic MERS-CoV by lowering the binding efficiency of MERS-CoV S to DPP4, suggesting that the DPP4 phenotype may impact the course of MERS-CoV infection.
