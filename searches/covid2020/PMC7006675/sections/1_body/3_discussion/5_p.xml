<p>The polymorphisms studied here occur with relatively low frequencies of one per ∼19,000 (A289V) to ∼245,000 (T288I) individuals. However, detailed information on the geographic distribution or incidence in certain ethnical groups is largely missing. Thus, DPP4 polymorphisms could contribute to the perplexing absence of MERS cases in Africa, where the virus circulates in camels [
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52–57</xref>]. However, recent evidence suggests that sequence variations between African and Arabian MERS-CoV might be a factor [
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. More importantly, it remains to be analyzed how frequent DPP4 polymorphisms that affect S protein binding occur in the Middle East and whether they are associated with the clinical course of MERS.
