<p>293T cells (grown in 6-well plates) were cotransfected with expression plasmids coding for solMERS-S1-Fc and WT or mutant DPP4. Cells transfected with empty expression vector instead of DPP4 or solMERS-S1-Fc (or both) served as controls. At 48 h posttransfection, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 500 µl/well NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM, Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% [v/v] NP-40, 1 tablet/100 ml of 
 <italic>Complete</italic> protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) by incubation for 45 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 16,400 x g at 4 °C, before 400 µl of the supernatant were mixed with 50 µl of protein A-sepharose (1 g protein A-sepharose [Sigma-Aldrich] in 4 ml PBS) while the residual 100 µl of the cell lysate were mixed with 100 µl 2x SDS-sample buffer and incubated for 15 min at 96 °C (These samples were later analyzed to confirm comparable total protein levels [via detection of ACTB] as well as comparable DPP4 and solMERS-S1-Fc levels before the co-immunoprecipitation [co-IP] step.). Following incubation of the lysate/protein A-sepharose mixtures for 2 h at 4 °C in an overhead shaker, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,400 x g at 4 °C to pellet the protein A-sepharose/solMERS-S1-Fc/DPP4-complexes. After aspiration of the supernatant, 500 µl of NP40 lysis buffer (without protease inhibitors) were added and the cells were mixed by vortexing, before being centrifuged again. This washing routine was repeated three times, before finally 50 µl of 2x SDS-sample buffer were added to the pelleted complexes and the samples were further incubated for 15 min at 96 °C. Thereafter, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (see above). Detection of DPP4 (lysate and co-IP samples) and ACTB (lysate samples) was carried out as described above. solMERS-S1-Fc was detected (lysate and co-IP samples) by incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-human antibody (goat, 1:5,000, Dianova).
