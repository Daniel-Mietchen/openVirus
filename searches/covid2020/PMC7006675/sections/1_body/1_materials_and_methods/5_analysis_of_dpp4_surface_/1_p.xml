<p>BHK-21 cells were transfected with expression vectors for WT or mutant DPP4, or empty expression vector (negative control). At 16 h post transfection, the culture medium was replaced and the cells were further incubated for additional 32 h. Then, the cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in PBS/BSA and pelleted by centrifugation (600 x g, 5 min, 4 °C). After aspiration of the supernatant, the cells were resuspended in PBS/BSA containing anti-DPP4 antibody (mouse, diluted 1:100, Abcam) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Next, the cells were pelleted, washed with PBS/BSA, pelleted again, resuspended in PBS/BSA containing AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (donkey, diluted 1:500, ThermoFisher Scientific) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed (as described above) and resuspended in PBS/PFA for 2 h at 4 °C for fixation. Finally, the cells were washed (as described above) and resuspended in PBS/BSA for flow cytometric analysis using an LSR II flow cytometer and the FACS Diva software (both BD Biosciences). Additional data analysis was carried out using the FCS Express 4 Flow research software (De Novo software). For quantification of DPP4 surface expression, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value of the negative control was subtracted from all samples. For normalization of DPP4 surface expression, values obtained for cells expressing DPP4 WT were set as 100% and the relative surface expression of the respective DPP4 mutants was calculated accordingly.</p>
