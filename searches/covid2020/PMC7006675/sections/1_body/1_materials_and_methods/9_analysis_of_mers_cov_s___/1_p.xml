<p>For the binding studies with soluble DPP4, a similar protocol was followed as described for the analysis of binding of solMERS-S1-Fc with the exceptions that a soluble DPP4 fused to the Fc region of human IgG (solDPP4-Fc, Acro Biosystems) was used instead of solMERS-S1-Fc (1:200 dilution in PBS/BSA) and that an AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-human antibody (goat, 1:500 dilution in PBS/BSA, ThermoFisher Scientific) was employed as the secondary antibody. 293T cells transfected with expression vectors for WT or mutant (D510G and D539N) MERS-CoV S, or empty expression vector (negative control) were analyzed by flow cytometry for solDPP4-Fc binding using an LSR II flow cytometer and the FACS Diva software (both BD Biosciences). Additional data analysis was carried out using the FCS Express 4 Flow research software (De Novo software). For quantification of solDPP4-Fc binding, the MFI value obtained for cells transfected with empty expression vector was subtracted from all samples. Further, binding of solDPP4-Fc to cells expressing MERS-CoV S WT was set as 100% and the relative binding efficiencies to cells expressing the respective MERS-CoV S mutants were calculated accordingly.</p>
