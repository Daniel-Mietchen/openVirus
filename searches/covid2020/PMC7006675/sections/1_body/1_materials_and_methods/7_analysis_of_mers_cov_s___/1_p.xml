<p>For the binding studies with solMERS-S1-Fc, a similar protocol was followed as described for the analysis of DPP4 surface expression with the exceptions that solMERS-S1-Fc was used instead of the primary antibody (1:10 dilution in PBS/BSA) and that an AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-human antibody (goat, 1:500 dilution in PBS/BSA, ThermoFisher Scientific) was employed as the secondary antibody. BHK-21 cells transfected with expression vectors for WT or mutant DPP4, ACE2 or empty expression vector (both negative controls) were analyzed by flow cytometry for solMERS-S1-Fc binding using an LSR II flow cytometer and the FACS Diva software (both BD Biosciences). Additional data analysis was carried out using the FCS Express 4 Flow research software (De Novo software). For quantification of solMERS-S1-Fc binding, the MFI value obtained for cells transfected with empty expression vector was subtracted from all samples. Further, binding of solMERS-S1-Fc to cells expressing DPP4 WT was set as 100% and the relative binding efficiencies to cells expressing the respective DPP4 mutants or ACE2 were calculated accordingly.</p>
