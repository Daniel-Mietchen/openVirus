<p>BHK-21 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with the different DPP4 constructs or empty expression vector using ICAFectin-441 (In-Cell-Art) at 24 h post seeding according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After changing the culture medium at 4 h post transfection, the cells were incubated for additional 20 h. Then, the culture medium was aspirated and the cells were washed with PBS, before they were fixed by incubated with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PBS/PFA) for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were washed with 0.1 M glycine/PBS solution followed by a washing step with PBS. Next, the coverslips were incubated with anti-DPP4 antibody (mouse, diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin [PBS/BSA], Abcam) for 1 h at 4 °C. For this, the coverslip was put on a drop (20 µl) of antibody solution that was added on a sheet of parafilm inside a humidity chamber (a glass dish in which the parafilm was placed on wet paper tissue). Thereafter, the cells were washed 3x with PBS before incubation with AlexaFluor568-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (goat, 1:1000, diluted in PBS/BSA, ThermoFisher Scientific) for 30 min at 4 °C was performed. Subsequently, the cells were washed 3x with PBS. Finally, the cells were incubated with DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Carl Roth) and mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (ThermoFisher Scientific) before they were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM800 (Zeiss) confocal laser scanning microscope and the ZEN imaging software (Zeiss).</p>
