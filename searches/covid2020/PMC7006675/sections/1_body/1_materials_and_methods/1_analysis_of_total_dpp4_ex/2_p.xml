<p>In order to quantify the signal intensity of the protein bands, the program ImageJ (FIJI distribution) [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was used. To account for differences in the total protein content of the samples and variations, we normalized the DPP4 signals against the respective signals of the loading control (ACTB).
