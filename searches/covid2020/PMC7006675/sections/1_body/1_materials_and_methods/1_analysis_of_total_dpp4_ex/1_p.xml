<p>293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for WT or mutant DPP4, or empty expression vector (negative control). At 16 h post transfection, the culture medium was replaced and the cells were further incubated for additional 32 h. Then, the cells were washed with PBS and mixed with 2x SDS-sample buffer (0.03 M Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.2% bromophenol blue, 1 mM EDTA). Cell lysis was achieved by incubating the samples for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation at 96 °C for an additional 10 min. The samples were further loaded on polyacrylamide gels and SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) was performed. Next, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hartenstein GmbH) by immunoblotting. The membranes were further blocked by incubation in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk powder) for 30 min at room temperature. Afterwards, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with undiluted supernatant of a hybridoma cell line secreting anti-cMYC antibody 9E10 (for DPP4 detection) or PBS-T containing anti-ß-actin (ACTB) antibody (mouse, 1:1,000, Sigma Aldrich). Following three washing intervals with PBS-T, the membranes were further incubated with PBS-T containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (goat, 1:5,000, Dianova) for 1 h at room temperature before an in house-prepared enhanced chemiluminescent solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 8.6], 250 µg/ml luminol, 1 mg/ml para-hydroxycoumaric acid, 0.3% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) was added and signals were recorded using the ChemoCam imaging system and the ChemoStar Professional software (Intas Science Imaging Instruments GmbH).
