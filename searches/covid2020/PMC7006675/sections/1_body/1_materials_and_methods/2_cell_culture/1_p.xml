<p>293T (human kidney cells, DSMZ no. ACC 635), BHK-21 (hamster kidney cells, DSMZ no. ACC 61) and Vero 76 (African green monkey kidney cells, kindly provided by Andrea Maisner, Philipps-University Marburg) were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (PAN-Biotech) while Caco-2 cells (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells) were cultivated in Minimum Essential Medium (ThermoFisher Scientific). The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom), 100 U/ml of penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin (PAN-Biotech). All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. For subcultivation and seeding, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and detached by incubation with trypsin/EDTA solution (PAN-Biotech) (BHK-21, Vero 76 and Caco-2) or by resuspending the cells in culture medium (293T). Transfection of 293T and BHK-21 cells was carried out by calcium-phosphate precipitation or with the help of ICAFectin-441 (In-Cell-Art) or FuGENE HD (Promega).</p>
