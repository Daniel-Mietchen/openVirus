<p>BHK-21 cells were transfected with expression vectors for wildtype or mutant DPP4 (K267E or A291P), or empty expression vector (negative control) using FuGENE HD (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with MERS-CoV (Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012, MERS-CoV EMC-2012, GenBank accession number: JX869059) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 for 1 h. Thereafter, the inoculum was removed and the cells were washed 3x with PBS before fresh medium was added and the first sample (time point 0 h postinfection) was taken. The cells were further incubated and additional samples were taken at 24 and 48 h postinfection. Viral titers in the culture supernatant were analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, using the upE assay according to a published protocol [

In brief, viral RNA was isolated from cell culture supernatant using the NucleoSpin RNA Virus kit (Macherey-Nagel), reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Superscript III one step RT–PCR system (ThermoFisher Scientific) and analyzed on a LightCycler 480 qPCR cycler platform (Roche) with primers and conditions as specified for the upE assay [
