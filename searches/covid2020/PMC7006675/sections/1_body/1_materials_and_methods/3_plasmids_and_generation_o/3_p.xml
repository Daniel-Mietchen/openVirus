<p>Soluble S comprising the S1 subdomain of MERS-CoV S (aa residues: 1â€“747) fused to a human IgG Fc tag was generated by inserting the PCR-amplified S1 sequences into the pCG1Fc vector [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] (kindly provided by Georg Herrler, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover) making use of the BamHI/SalI restriction sites. In addition, we generated an expression vector for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) by inserting the eGFP coding sequence, which was PCR-amplified from the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech), into the pCAGGS plasmid using the EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites.
