<p>We further utilized pCAGGS-based expression vectors for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G), MERS-CoV S wildtype (WT) and MERS-CoV S (D510G) (the latter two either untagged or equipped with a C-terminal V5 epitope) that have been described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35â€“37</xref>]. In addition, a previously described expression vector for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 was employed [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Similar to the strategy used for the generation of DPP4 mutants, we employed the overlap-extension PCR technique to introduce a single mutation into the MERS-CoV S open reading frame, thus generating untagged and V5-tagged MERS-CoV S (D539N).
