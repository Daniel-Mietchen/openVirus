<p>DPP4 is a prolyl oligopeptidase that is expressed in various tissues [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and involved in multiple biological processes including T-cell activation [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], control of the activity of growth factors, chemokines and bioactive peptides [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref>], and regulation of the glucose metabolism [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Mature DPP4 is embedded in the plasma membrane as a homodimer and each monomer consists of an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a large ectodomain, which can be further subdivided into a short stalk domain, a glycosylation-rich and a cysteine-rich region as well as the C-terminal catalytic domain (α/β-hydrolase domain) [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Polymorphisms in the DPP4 gene were implicated in several diseases and conditions, including diabetes [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and myocardial infarction [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] but their potential impact on MERS-CoV infection has not been analyzed.
