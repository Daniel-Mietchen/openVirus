<p>In order to infect a host (cell) and replicate, MERS-CoV has to deliver its genome into the cellular cytoplasm for gene translation and genome replication. This process is facilitated by the viral spike (S) glycoprotein, a type-I transmembrane protein embedded in the viral envelope. For host cell entry, the surface unit, S1, of MERS-CoV S binds to the cellular type-II transmembrane protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The structure of the interface between DPP4 and MERS-CoV-S was resolved on the atomic level and fifteen residues in DPP4 were found to make direct contact with residues in the viral S protein [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Upon DPP4 engagement, MERS-CoV S undergoes proteolytic activation through the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 or the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17â€“19</xref>], which allows the transmembrane unit, S2, of MERS-CoV S to fuse the viral membrane with cellular membranes.
