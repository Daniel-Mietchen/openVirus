<p>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. It belongs to the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family (genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>), which is part of the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. MERS-CoV was isolated in 2012 from the sputum of a 60 year old man suffering from acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since its discovery, MERS-CoV has caused 2,442 human infections of which 842 (34.5%) had a fatal outcome (as of May, 2019) [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Dromedary camels are reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV and display only common cold-like symptoms upon infection but constitute the main source of human infections. Transmission to humans occurs via close contact to animals or contaminated animal products [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref>]. Human-to-human transmissions seem limited and were mainly observed in health care settings, leading to MERS outbreaks in hospitals [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7–12</xref>]. Finally, differences in the tissue specific expression of the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV, DPP4, were recently suggested to account for the differences in MERS-CoV transmission and disease induction in camels and humans, respectively [
