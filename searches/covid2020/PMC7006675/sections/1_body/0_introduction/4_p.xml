<p>We asked whether naturally-occurring amino acid polymorphisms in DPP4 residues making contact with MERS-CoV S have an impact on MERS-CoV entry. We identified fourteen polymorphisms by screening public databases and introduced the respective mutations into a DPP4 expression plasmid. We identified four mutations that reduced MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4 and MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry without affecting DPP4 expression at the cell surface.</p>
