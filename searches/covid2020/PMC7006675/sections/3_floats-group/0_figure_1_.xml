  <p>Identification of polymorphic amino acid residues in DPP4 at the binding interface with MERS-CoV S. (A) Schematic representation of DPP4 (CD26). Highlighted are the transmembrane domain (TD, brown), glycosylation-rich (blue) and cysteine-rich (orange) regions, and the catalytic domain (purple). Circles with sticks represent glycosylation sites, while small numbers indicate the amino acid residues. Triangles below the domains highlight the positions of amino acid residues that directly interact with MERS-CoV S (grey triangles mark residues for which no polymorphism has been reported, while red triangles indicate polymorphic residues). (B) Side (left) and top (right) view of homodimeric DPP4 (the dotted line indicates the border between the two monomers and the cellular plasma membrane is schematically depicted below the side view model of DPP4). The protein model was constructed on the published crystal structure (4PV7) deposited in RSCB PDB and the binding interface with MERS-CoV S has been highlighted (green). (C) Close-up on the DPP4 residues that directly interact with MERS-CoV S and for which no polymorphic (yellow) or polymorphic (red) residues have been reported. In addition, the specific residues in DPP4 (regular letters and numbers), including the respective polymorphic residues (letters in brackets), and the corresponding interacting residues in MERS-CoV S (italicized letters and numbers) are indicated. (D) Frequency of polymorphic DPP4 residues in the human population. Public databases (see Supplementary Table 1 and the materials and methods section for detailed information) were screened for the frequency of the polymorphic residues under study (y-axis). Error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM) and refer to polymorphic residues found in more than one database.</p>
