  <p>DPP4 harboring polymorphic amino acid residues at the binding interface with MERS-CoV S are efficiently transported to the cell surface. (A) Wildtype (WT) and mutant DPP4 were expressed in BHK-21 cells (cells transfected with empty expression vector served as negative control). Surface expressed DPP4 was stained by subsequent incubation of the non-permeabilized cells with a primary antibody that targets the DPP4 ectodomain and an AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary antibody. Fluorescent signals representing surface-expressed DPP4 were analyzed by flow cytometry and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for each sample were calculated. For normalization, the MFI value of the negative control was subtracted from all samples. Further, surface expression of DPP4 WT was set as 100% and the relative surface expression of the DPP4 mutants was calculated accordingly. Shown are the combined data of three experiments with error bars indicating the SEM. Statistical significance for differences in surface expression between WT and mutant DPP4 was tested by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s posttest (
   <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, not significant; 
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05, *). (B) DPP4 surface expression was further analyzed by immunofluorescence analysis. For this, DPP4 WT or DPP4 mutants were expressed in BHK-21 cells grown on coverslips (cells transfected with empty expression vector served as negative control). After fixation of the cells, surface expressed DPP4 was stained by subsequent incubation of non-permeabilized cells with a primary antibody that targets the DPP4 ectodomain and an AlexaFluor568-conjugated secondary antibody. In addition, cellular nuclei were stained with DAPI. Finally, images were taken using a confocal laser scanning microscope at a magnification of 80x.
