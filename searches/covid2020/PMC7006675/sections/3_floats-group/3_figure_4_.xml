  <p>Identification of polymorphic amino acid residues in DPP4 that do not support efficient MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry. (A) To investigate whether mutant DPP4 support host cell entry driven by MERS-CoV S, we produced vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype particles (VSVpp) harboring MERS-CoV S (left) or VSV G (control, right). VSVpp were further inoculated on BHK-21 cells expressing wildtype (WT) or mutant DPP4, or cells that were transfected with empty expression vector. At 16 h posttransduction, transduction efficiency was analyzed by measuring the activity of virus-encoded firefly luciferase. Shown are the combined data from three independent experiments (each performed in quadruplicates) for which transduction efficiency of cells expressing DPP4 WT was set as 100%. Error bars indicate the SEM. Statistical significance of differences in transduction efficiency of cells expressing WT or mutant DPP4 was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s posttest (
