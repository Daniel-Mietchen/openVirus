  <p>Reduced MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry is caused by inefficient S protein binding to DPP4 harboring polymorphic amino acid residues. In order to investigate whether reduced MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry and MERS-CoV replication is due to inefficient MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4 harboring amino acid polymorphisms at the binding interface, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) as well as binding experiments with a soluble S protein comprising the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV S fused to the Fc region of human IgG. (A) 293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids coding for soluble, Fc-tagged MERS-CoV S1 (solMERS-S1-Fc) and the indicated DPP4 variant containing a C-terminal cMYC-tag. Cells that were transfected only with empty expression vector alone, or empty expression vector instead of either solMERS-S1-Fc or DPP4 served as controls. At 48 h posttransduction, cells were lysed and incubated with protein A sepharose. Next, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. DPP4 levels were detected via antibodies specific for the cMYC-tag, whereas solMERS-S1-Fc was detected using a peroxidase-coupled anti-human antibody. Similar results were obtained in three individual experiments. Analysis of whole cell lysates (WCL) for expression of solMERS-S1-Fc, DPP4 and ß-actin confirmed comparable ß-actin levels in each sample and comparable expression levels for solMERS-S1-Fc and DPP4. (B) For quantification of MERS-CoV S/DPP4 interaction we first normalized the DPP4 signals against the respective solMERS-S1-Fc signals. Then, MERS-CoV S/DPP4 interaction was set as 100% for wildtype (WT) DPP4 and the relative interaction efficiency for each DPP4 mutant was calculated accordingly. Presented are the mean data from three independent experiments. Error bars indicate the SEM. Statistical significance of differences in MERS-CoV S/DPP4 interaction between WT and mutant DPP4 was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s posttest (

   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05, *; 
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001, ***). (C) Soluble MERS-CoV S1-Fc was incubated with BHK-21 cells expressing wildtype (WT) or mutant DPP4, or cells transfected with empty expression vector or an ACE2-expression plasmid (controls). To detect bound S protein, the cells were subsequently incubated with an AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-human antibody directed against the Fc-tag. Fluorescent signals representing bound solMERS-S1-Fc were analyzed by flow cytometry and MFI values for each sample were calculated. For normalization, the MFI value of the negative control (empty expression vector) was subtracted from all samples. Further, binding of solMERS-S1-Fc to cells expressing DPP4 WT was set as 100% and the relative binding to cells expressing the DPP4 mutants was calculated accordingly. Shown are the combined data of five independent experiments with error bars indicating the SEM. Statistical significance of differences in solMERS-S1-Fc binding to cells expressing WT or mutant DPP4 was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s posttest (
