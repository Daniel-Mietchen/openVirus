  <p>DPP4 harboring polymorphic amino acid residues at the binding interface with MERS-CoV S are robustly expressed. (A) Wildtype (WT) and mutant DPP4 were expressed in 293T cells (cells transfected with empty expression vector served as negative control). Whole cell lysates (WCL) were prepared and analyzed for DPP4 expression by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and WB using a primary antibody targeting the C-terminal cMYC epitope and a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Further, expression of beta-actin (ACTB) was analyzed as a loading control. Shown are the expression data from a representative experiment. Numbers at the left indicate the molecular weight in kilodalton (kDa). (B) Quantification of total DPP4 expression in WCL. After normalization of DPP4 band intensities with that of the corresponding ACTB bands. DPP4 WT expression was set as 100% and the relative expression of mutant DPP4 was calculated accordingly. Presented are the combined data of three independent experiments with error bars indicating the SEM. No statistical significance for differences in total expression between WT and mutant DPP4 was observed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s posttest (
