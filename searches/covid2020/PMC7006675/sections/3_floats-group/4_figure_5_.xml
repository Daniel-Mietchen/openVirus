  <p>DPP4 harboring polymorphic amino acid residues at the binding interface with MERS-CoV S poorly support replication of live MERS-CoV. Two DPP4 mutants that showed reduced compatibility for MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry (K267E and A291P) were analyzed in the context of infection and replication of authentic MERS-CoV. For this, BHK-21 cells expressing wildtype (WT) or mutant DPP4, or no DPP4 at all (negative control) were inoculated with MERS-CoV. At 1 h postinfection, the inoculum was removed and the cells were washed before they received fresh culture medium and were further incubated. MERS-CoV replication was analyzed at 0, 24 and 48 h postinfection by determining MERS-CoV genome equivalents (GE) in the culture supernatant (given as GE/ml) by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. Shown are the combined results of three independent experiments (each performed in triplicates). Error bars indicate the SEM. Statistical significance of differences in MERS-CoV replication in cells expressing WT or mutant DPP4 was analyzed by two-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s posttest (
