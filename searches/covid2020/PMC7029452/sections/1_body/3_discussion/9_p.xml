<p>The rapid and collaborative management of the first imported COVID-19 cases in France highlights the fact that the French healthcare system is adequately prepared to respond to such emerging diseases threats. However, this surveillance system is extremely time-consuming and requires considerable manpower. The data available on 12 February strongly suggest that human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is frequent, with the reproduction number estimated at 2 to 3 [

Especially the occurrence of large clusters in the same region would strongly impact on the local health authoritiesâ€™ capacities. The surveillance objectives would then need to evolve from containing the epidemic to mitigating its medical and societal impact.
