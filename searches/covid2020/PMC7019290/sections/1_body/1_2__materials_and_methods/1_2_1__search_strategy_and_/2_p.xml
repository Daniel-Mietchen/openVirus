<p>Titles and abstracts of all unique references were screened by two independent reviewers (K.T.T.K. and D.F.N.). After first screening, full texts of remaining articles were assessed for eligibility. Articles that were not written in English were excluded. We also excluded conference abstracts and articles that did not report any original data (i.e., review papers, editorial, and commentaries). Only studies that performed viral metagenomic sequencing in specimens from farm animals were included. We included studies that focused on cattle, small ruminants (goats and sheep), poultry, and pigs. The flow of the systematic review was adapted from the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [
