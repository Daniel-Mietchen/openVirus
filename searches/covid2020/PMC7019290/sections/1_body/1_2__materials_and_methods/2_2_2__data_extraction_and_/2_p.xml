<p>Data cleaning, stratification, analysis, and visualization was performed using R packages [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] (dplyr [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], ggplot2 [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], reshape2 [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and stringr [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). Information on host range and taxonomy of different virus families was adapted from ViralZone [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and International Committee Taxonomy of Viruses [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The host range of different virus families were stratified into seven groups: vertebrate virus, invertebrate virus, bacteriophage, plant virus, other virus not classified into the first four categories (e.g., mycovirus and archaeal virus etc.), virus with multiple hosts, and unclassified virus/virus with unknown host(s). Geographical origins of included studies were stratified according to World Health Organization (WHO) regions: Africa region, the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean region, European region, South-East Asia region, and the Western Pacific region. Health conditions of farm animals were stratified into four major groups: healthy, gastrointestinal signs, respiratory signs, and other clinical signs. The category “other clinical signs” refers to any clinical signs that could not be classified into the first three categories and unspecified health conditions. Studies were stratified into seven arbitrary types based on their primary findings: virome study (i.e., papers that focused on studying the virus diversity of the animals), genetic characterization, mNGS as a diagnostic tool, mNGS as a diagnostic tool and virome study, virus discovery (i.e., papers that primarily focused on discovery of novel viruses), methodology papers, and others. Sequencing platforms were stratified into four main sequencing platforms: 454 pyrosequencing (Roche), Illumina, Ion Torrent (Thermo Fisher), and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Sample sizes were stratified into six arbitrary groups: less than 10, 11–50, 51–100, 101–500, 501–1500, and unspecified sample size. Nucleic acid extraction strategies were stratified into four groups: column-based, solvent-based (e.g., chloroform and TRIzol [Thermo Fisher]), magnetic bead-based, and other/multiple types of extraction methods.
