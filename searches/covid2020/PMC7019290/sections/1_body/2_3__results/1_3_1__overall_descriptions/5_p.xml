<p>In terms of viral enrichment strategies, we found that half of the included studies performed filtration steps, majority (68.3%, N = 82) performed nuclease treatment, and 45.8% (N = 55) studies performed DNA/RNA amplification steps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00107-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Almost half of the studies (N = 58) extracted both DNA and RNA and around one-third of the studies extracted RNA only (N = 44). For extraction strategies, majority used the column-based method (N = 62), followed by the solvent-based method (19.2%, N = 23), and the magnetic bead-based method (6.7%, N = 8).
