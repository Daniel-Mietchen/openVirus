<p>In terms of metadata availability, only one-fifth of the included studies specified farm types and nearly 40% of the studies did not mention the age of the farm animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00107-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Twenty-eight percent and 40% of studies pooled specimens between farms and within farms together for sequencing, respectively. More than 95% of the studies did not specify whether there were technical controls for validating the sequencing results. For data availability, only 10.8% (N = 13) provided raw sequencing data in the public repository, either the SRA or ENA. There is no distinct pattern when comparing metadata and data availability in studies with different study rationales.
