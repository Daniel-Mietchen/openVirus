<p>The greatest diversity of viruses was observed in samples from poultry, with 49 virus families reported in the available literature, followed by cattle with viruses found from 33 families and pigs with 32 families (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00107-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In comparison, only 20 virus families were reported in studies involving small ruminants. Fifteen vertebrate virus families were reported in both pigs and poultry, followed by cattle (N = 14) and small ruminants (N = 6). Apart from vertebrate viruses, bacteriophages and plant viruses were found in all four types of livestock while invertebrate viruses were only detected in cattle and poultry. Bacteriophage belonging to families 
 <italic>Myoviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Podoviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Siphoviridae</italic> were detected in all four livestock types. Interestingly, the diversity of plant viruses was identified highest in poultry with seven plant virus families detected (compared to two each for pigs and cattle, and one for small ruminants). Overall, 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Astroviridae</italic> were among the three most frequently found virus families identified. There was no distinguishable pattern when comparing genera of the above-listed three most abundantly found virus families in the four major health conditions (

 <italic>Enterovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>bocaparvovirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>dependoparvovirus</italic> were reported in all four livestock types (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00107-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Viruses within the 
 <italic>Astroviridae</italic> family were host species-specific as 
 <italic>avastrovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>mamastrovirus</italic> were only found in poultry and mammals, respectively (
