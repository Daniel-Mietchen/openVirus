<p>Advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and rapid development of bioinformatics and computational tools offer new opportunities for EID surveillance in quality and in scale. Particularly, metagenomic NGS (mNGS) allows unbiased detection of all microbes and viruses in a sample, showing potential for timely detection of rare or novel infectious etiologies, as well as for surveillance of foodborne and waterborne viruses [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the use of mNGS as a potential surveillance tool requires a deeper understanding of what is “normal” diversity in humans [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and farm animals [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Characterizing species-specific metagenomes could potentially be used to provide a surveillance baseline for early detection and for tracking of movements of pathogens across different hosts, and has been promoted by projects like the global virome project [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, for such applications, detailed background is needed regarding coverage, representativeness, and biases in the study designs. Here, we conduct a systematic review to identify available literature that performed viral mNGS in common farm animals including cattle, small ruminants (goats and sheep), poultry, and pigs. We reviewed the data and metadata availability and quality of these studies. We further summarized reported viromes of common farm animals in order to translate these efforts as background virus diversity profiles of common farm animals to guide preparedness of diseases at the livestock-human interface.
