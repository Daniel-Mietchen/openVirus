<p>Intensification of livestock farming is widely practiced in support of increasing food demand due to human population growth. This, in turn, facilitates disease transmissions within herds and between livestock and humans by increasing livestock population and density [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Two years later, another highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 virus emerged in Asia in 2005, probably as a result of frequent mixing between flocks and wild birds, suggesting that pre-existing biosecurity measurements could not keep up with the rate of livestock intensification [

 <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> infections, with animal abortion waves that had gone unnoticed. The policy of voluntary reporting abortion outbreaks to the Animal Health Service hindered the timely detection of the circulation of Q fever, and therefore early interventions. These examples indicate that zoonotic risks in the livestock industry should be carefully managed and adapted to livestock intensification. The One Health approach has been coined for advocating collaboration between multiple stakeholders including veterinarians, clinicians, epidemiologists, virologists, microbiologists, ecologists, and policy makers to prevent and control EIDs through the human-animal-environment interface [
