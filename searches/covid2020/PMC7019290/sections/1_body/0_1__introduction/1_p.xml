<p>Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are responsible for a substantial burden of mortality and morbidity globally, and a majority of EIDs (60.3%) are caused by zoonotic pathogens [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the past decades, high impact outbreaks have occurred with introductions from wildlife and livestock reservoirs, respectively, exemplified by the wildlife-borne outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and outbreaks resulting from contact with livestock animals, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS] [
