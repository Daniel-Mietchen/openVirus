<p>Although the global population of goats and sheep exceeds that of pigs [
 <xref rid="B138-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>], only nine mNGS studies of samples from small ruminants were identified in our review and hence it is not surprising that reported virus diversity of small ruminants was the lowest when compared to other common farm animals. Even though zoonoses from small ruminants such as chlamydiosis are thought to be transmitted via direct contact, the example of Q fever has shown the potential for spread by inhalation of contaminated aerosol [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. The largest Dutch Q-fever outbreak in 2007â€“2010 with more than 3500 cases certainly indicated that zoonotic risk from small ruminants should not be underestimated [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and in line with the predominance of viruses as causes of emerging disease outbreaks, studies are needed to characterize the virome of small ruminants and its possible relationship to the health and disease of exposed humans.
