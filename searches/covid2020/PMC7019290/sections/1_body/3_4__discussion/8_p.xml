<p>To our best knowledge, this is the first systematic review that summarizes available literature that performed viral mNGS in farm animal samples. These aforementioned limitations of the reviewed dataset may hinder the reusability of the published metagenomic data. An incredible amount of metagenomics data is being generated these days as we speak, given reduced costs of sequencing and increased availability of NGS platforms. Therefore, timing is perfect to take one step further to implement good data management practices referred as the “FAIR” (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles [
 <xref rid="B151-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. In brief, data should be properly indexed and easy to find and assess. Data should also be described with rich and well-defined metadata that can be interpreted by humans and computers. By making metagenomic data “FAIR”, reusability of the data can be optimized so the data can be combined into meta-analysis settings. Minimum datasets for the sharing of pathogen genomic data have already been established through the global microbial identifier project [
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. We propose to always include breed types, age of the animals, and farm types in the minimal metadata set to allow determination of viral fingerprints of different farm animals. More “FAIR” metagenomic data of farm animals would be favorable for future large-scale farm animal virome characterization analysis that can guide zoonotic outbreak preparedness.
