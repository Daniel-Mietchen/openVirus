<p>The rapid and extensive development of NGS has opened up more opportunities to advance understanding in infectious disease diagnostics, surveillance, and transmission [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. One of the key NGS applications is the primer-independent, agnostic (i.e., without prior knowledge) viral metagenomics to characterize all viruses present in the samples, and also allow the discovery of novel or uncommon infectious etiologies [

 <xref rid="B135-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. In this review, we summarize previous studies that performed viral mNGS in common farm animals including cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and pigs in an effort to provide background virus diversity profiles of these farm animals. Information systematically summarized from this review will help to guide the design of future studies employing mNGS for surveillance as well as preparedness for detection of diseases at the livestock-human interface.
