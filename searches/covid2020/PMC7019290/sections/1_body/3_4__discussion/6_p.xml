<p>There are limitations in our review dataset of the available farm animal mNGS studies. Reporting bias might be introduced with different study objectives and research interests, the use of different algorithms for metagenomic analysis, reference databases [
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>], and different sample preparation strategies (e.g., presence/absence of nuclease treatment, filtration and random amplification, different sizes of filters used, and centrifugation strategies) [
 <xref rid="B144-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Some studies performed pooling among samples from different farms. This practice is cost-effective for a resource-limited setting, however viruses with low abundance may be diluted and missed. About 90% of studies did not provide raw sequencing data on SRA or ENA which hampers cross-study comparison and future large-scale reanalysis and interpretation. This is crucial, as it has been shown that outputs from metagenomic workflows are not directly comparable with the use of different algorithms and reference databases. Data sharing is also warranted for successful pathogen surveillance and outbreak detection [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B146-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] and our review shows that there is much to be gained in the field of metagenomics. It was difficult to compare virome composition of farm animals from different farm types and of different ages in available studies. Over 80% and 40% of available studies did not specify farm type and age of farm animals. We observed that metadata availability is consistently lacking in available literature regardless of different study types. Our review shows that the current state of the art is far from providing such information as the minimal metadata that is needed to select datasets for analysis is rarely provided with published reports. In the longer term, a better understanding of the association between farm types and virome composition of farm animals would guide farm management practices for reducing risks from zoonoses. In the meantime, it is important to benchmark metagenomic tools and reference databases [
