<p>The majority of available farm animal viral mNGS literature studied pigs, which may be explained by the emergence and global spread of swine viruses such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [
 <xref rid="B136-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>] and African Swine Fever virus [
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] in the recent decade. Indeed, these viruses were reported in our included studies [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00107" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Other mNGS studies also found hepatitis E viruses in pigs, known to be zoonotic. In addition to these known animal viruses, a wide range of other viruses have been described in different livestock by using mNGS, highlighting the potential for using mNGS to identify not only viruses that affect the animals, but also zoonotic and novel viruses.
