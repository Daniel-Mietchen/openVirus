<p>We showed that 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Astroviridae</italic> were among the most commonly identified virus families in common farm animals. Therefore, although sample sizes were relatively small, these virus families may be signature viruses to indicate livestock exposure. For instance, 
 <italic>Avastrovirus</italic>, an avian virus, so far has only been reported in poultry sample metagenomes. Multiple signature viruses would be required to set up a viral fingerprint profile for each livestock type, as one genetic marker may not be sensitive and/or specific enough. In our studies, we aim to identify stable signatures to allow tracking the flow of viruses between different livestock, humans, and the surrounding environment.
