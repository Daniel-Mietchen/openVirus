 <caption> An overview of study design and data (and metadata) availability of 120 included publications. Each column represents one paper, and numbers refer to the list of references ( Supplementary Materials). Rows describe data fields extracted from the papers as follows (from top to bottom): study rationale, sequencing platforms, sample sizes, availability of sequencing data in public repository, availability of animal age description, availability of farm type description, indication of whether filtration was performed, indication of whether nuclease treatment was performed during sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction strategy, type of nucleic acid extracted, indication of whether nucleic acid amplification was performed, indication of whether sample pooling was performed in same/different farms, and mention of technical controls for validating sequencing results. Categories and color codes for each data field are indicated in the figure legend. Gray boxes indicate that the technique was not performed, or the information was not specified. mNGS = metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing. SRA = Sequence Read Archive. ENA = European Nucleotide Archive. NA = nucleic acid. </caption>
