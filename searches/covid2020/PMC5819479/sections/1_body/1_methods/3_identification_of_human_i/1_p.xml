<p>Viruses were eligible for inclusion in our catalogue only if they were classified as species by the ICTV as of July 21st 2017. The main ICTV criteria for defining RNA virus species are: relatedness based on sequence data; serological cross-reactivity; host range; and transmission route. We note that our focus on species ignores pertinent within-species variation. For example, there is huge variation in the epidemiology of subtypes of 
 <italic>Influenza A virus</italic>: contrast the human influenza viruses such as H1N1 and H3N2 with avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 and H7N9 that only occasionally infect humans. Although 
 <italic>Influenza A virus</italic> is exceptionally variable in this respect, there are other virus species with distinct subtypes that differ in traits such as antigenicity (e.g. 
 <italic>Dengue virus</italic>) or host preference (e.g. 
 <italic>Rabies virus</italic>). Here, we combine the traits of all identified subtypes to make up the traits of that virus species as a whole.
