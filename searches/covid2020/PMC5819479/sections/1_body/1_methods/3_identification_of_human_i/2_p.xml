<p>Our list of human-infective RNA viruses results from a series of systematic literature reviews carried out over the past 18 years. Literature reviews covered multiple reference databases (Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus), supplemented by secondary sources such as the WHO and CDC web sites, moderated web resources such as ProMed [
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.promedmail.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.promedmail.org/</ext-link>] and one comprehensive review article

 </sup>. We also followed up primary references linked to RNA virus genome sequence data in NCBI [

Structured searches typically included the following key words: human and virus and (case* or patient* or infection* or disease* or outbreak* or zoono*). Searches for newly reported viruses added the key word term: (new or novel). The critical criteria for inclusion in the database are: i) RNA virus species recognised by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as of July 2017); ii) peer-reviewed primary report providing robust evidence of human infection.
