<p>Literature reviews for host range data were conducted within Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus. Structured search key words were: (virus name and all synonyms listed by ICTV separated by ‘or’) and (host or range or reservoir or animal or mammal or bird or avian). Data on host range is supported by peer-reviewed primary publications where available (PubMed IDs and hyperlinks provided), supplemented by information from the Global Mammal Parasite Database

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>
 </sup> and one primary publication
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Our data were supplemented by reference to an extensive data set on virus-mammal associations provided prior to publication by Kevin Olival of EcoHealth Alliance in New York; these data have since been published
