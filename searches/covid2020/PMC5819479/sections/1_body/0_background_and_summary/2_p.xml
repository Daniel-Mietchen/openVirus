<p>Our research group first published a catalogue of human-infective RNA viruses (and other infectious agents) in 2001
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Since then we have regularly refined our methodology and updated the catalogue as new human-infective RNA viruses are recognised and reported in the scientific literature
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
 </sup>. In addition to identifying human-infective viruses, we record a number of traits including the date of the first report of human infection, transmissibility in human populations, transmission route(s) and host range (all fully described below).
