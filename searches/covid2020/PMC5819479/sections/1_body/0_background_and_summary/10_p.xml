<p>We hope that this database will be of value to researchers undertaking comparative studies of human-infective RNA viruses, as well as being a useful reference for those interested in pathogen diversity. We also hope that the database will continue to be a valuable tool for identifying characteristics of viruses likely to pose the greatest emerging public health threat. We note that the database could be extended to include further information on human-infective RNA viruses. We welcome and encourage suggestions from the scientific community for updating the information contained in the database, with the proviso that all information included must be supported by a published literature reference.</p>
