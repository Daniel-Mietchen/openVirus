<p>The accumulation of (currently) ICTV-recognised, human-infective RNA virus species up to 2015 is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. The figure goes back to 1901, when the discovery of the first human virus species–
 <italic>Yellow fever virus</italic>–was reported. The number of species increases slowly up to the mid 1950s and somewhat faster thereafter. Methods are available for extrapolating from this curve to predict future rates of discovery and the total diversity of human-infective RNA virus species

 </sup>. We note that there is often a lag of several years between a novel virus being reported to infect humans and that virus being recognised as a new species, or not, by ICTV. As of July 2017 there were more than 20 putative RNA virus species in that category. For this reason we extend 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> only to the end of 2015. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> also depicts the accumulation of (currently) ICTV-recognised RNA virus genera and families known to contain human-infective species.
