<p>For each virus, we record all known transmission routes, categorised as follows and fully defined in the Methods section: inhalation; ingestion; sexual contact; any form of direct physical contact; fomites; bites/broken skin; iatrogenic; vector (biting arthropod); maternal. The distribution of virus species by transmission route is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>. It is noteworthy that 91 (43%) of species can be transmitted by vectors (invariably a fly or tick).
