<p>This catalogue and metadata have been used in a number of ways. First, to estimate the diversity of human-infective RNA viruses using two techniques, extrapolation of the virus discovery curve
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>
 </sup> and an ecological diversity measure
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Second, they have been used to identify traits associated with newly emerging viruses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
 </sup>. Third, they have been used to identify RNA viruses with future epidemic potential in human populations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>
 </sup>. Chikungunya virus, Ebola virus and Zika virus all met the criteria prior to their actual emergence in 2005, 2014 and 2015 respectively. It has also contributed to the World Health Organisationâ€™s Blueprint for R&amp;D preparedness and response to public health emergencies due to highly infectious pathogens
