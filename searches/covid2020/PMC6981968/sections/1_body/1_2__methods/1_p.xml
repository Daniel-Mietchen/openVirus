<p>Data were obtained from the MERS-CoV information website (
 <uri xlink:href="http://mers.go.kr/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://mers.go.kr/</uri>) managed by the Korean Ministry of Health &amp; Welfare. This website provides information regarding the statistics and management status for MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-00305" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These data contained daily statistics regarding numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases, quarantined individuals, patients undergoing treatment, and deaths and other countriesâ€™ MERS-CoV related information. We included daily numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and quarantined individuals from 20 May 2015 to 5 July 2015 in a time-series analysis. 20 May was chosen because it was the day on which MERS-CoV was confirmed in the first patient in Korea. There were no additional laboratory-confirmed cases after 5 July 2015. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the institution with which the first and second authors were affiliated.
