      <p>This study examined the effect of disclosing a list of hospitals with Middle East
         respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) patients on the number of laboratory-confirmed
         MERS-CoV cases in South Korea. MERS-CoV data from 20 May 2015 to 5 July 2015 were
         from the Korean Ministry of Health &amp; Welfare website and analyzed using segmented
         linear autoregressive error models for interrupted time series. This study showed
         that the number of laboratory-confirmed cases was increased by 9.632 on 5 June (
         
         <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). However, this number was significantly decreased following disclosure of
         a list of hospitals with MERS-CoV cases (Estimate = âˆ’0.699; 
         
         <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Disclosing the list of hospitals exposed to MERS-CoV was critical to the
         prevention of further infection. It reduced the number of confirmed MERS-CoV cases.
         Thus, providing accurate and timely information is a key to critical care response.
