<p>The ecological effects of antimicrobial selection pressure, including its effects on the human and animal microbiome, are poorly understood. Antimicrobial use in production animals has been restricted in Australia following the recommendations of the Swann report.
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> When avoparcin use in feedlot cattle was shown to increase the prevalence of 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> resistance to vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic used for the treatment of human infections),
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> it was voluntarily withdrawn from the Australian market. Fluoroquinolones were never approved for use in production animals in Australia, which probably explains the low levels of fluoroquinolone resistance observed in 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic> species compared with other countries where agricultural use is unrestricted.

 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Recent descriptions of highly resistant bacteria found on chicken and swine farms in China, linked to outbreaks of human infection with bacteria containing similar plasmid-mediated resistance, offer a stark example of the health risks associated with unregulated antimicrobial use in production animals.
