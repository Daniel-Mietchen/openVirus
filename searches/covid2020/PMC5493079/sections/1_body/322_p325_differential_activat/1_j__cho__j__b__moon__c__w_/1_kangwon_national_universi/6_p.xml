<p id="Par2947">The average infarct size of the left ventricle circumference was about 44 % after MI. Neuronal damage/death was not detected in both PVNH and PVNT after MI. c-Fos immunoreactive (+) cells were hardly found in both nuclei of the sham-group. However, c-Fos + cells were increased in both nuclei after MI and peaked in the PVNH and PVNT 3 days and 14 days, respectively, after MI. At 56 days after MI, c-Fos + cells were barely found in both nuclei.</p>
