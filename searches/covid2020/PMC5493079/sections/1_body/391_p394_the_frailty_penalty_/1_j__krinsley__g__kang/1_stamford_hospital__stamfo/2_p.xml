 <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data, and includes all 10,149 patients admitted to the 16 bed intensive care unit of our university-affiliated hospital between 10/1/05 and 9/30/15. We abstracted information from the ICU’s database, including diagnoses, APACHE II scores (APII), APACHE IV predictions of mortality (APIVM) and hospital discharge status. We prospectively characterized patients as FS1 (fully independent, n = 8,146), FS2 (partly dependent, living at home, n = 1,026) and FS3 (not living at home, n = 977). We stratified by severity of illness, compared observed:expected mortality ratios (O:E) and created a multivariable model to assess the independent effect of FS on mortality.
