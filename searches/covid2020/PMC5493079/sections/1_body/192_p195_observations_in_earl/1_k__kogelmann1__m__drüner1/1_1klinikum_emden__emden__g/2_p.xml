 <bold>Methods:</bold> We collected data from 14 Patients treated additional with cytokine-haemadsorption filter (Cytosorb) as adjunctive therapy in septic shock or severe SIRS. The focus was abdominal (28.6 %), pneumonia (50 %) and pancreatitis (14.3 %). Aim of our case study was to show the effectiveness of Cytosorb treatment used as adjunctive therapy in critically ill patients. If there was no decrease of catecholamine demand and kidney injury persistent after initial therapy following actual guidelines [2], Cytosorb therapy was initiated. We collected data before, during and after treatment and calculated demand of norepinephrine (μg/h vs. thereby achieved mm Hg MAP).
