 <bold>Introduction:</bold> In several studies and in vitro data is demonstrated that the additional treatment with an extracorporal cytokine adsorption filter (Cytosorb, Cytosorbents corp.) may be helpful in patients with multiorgan failure due to increased cytokine levels [1]. CytoSorb is used as adjunctive therapy not only in septic multiorgan failure as well as in severe pancreatitis and other critical ill patients and is well tolerated and safe.
