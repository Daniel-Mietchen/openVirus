 <bold>Results:</bold> 42.8 % patients were female, mean age was 56,4 years, APACHE II Score was 37, overall survival was 35,7 %. In contrast, survival in Cytosorb therapy start delay 24 h was 66.7 %. Poor outcome increased in patients with late start of Cytosorb (survivors: therapy start delay &lt; 48 h: 50 %, delay &gt; 48 h: none). Cytosorb therapy start in nonsurvivors was by far later than in survivors (61,3 h vs 28,8 h). After Cytosorb therapy we observed pronounced decrease of catecholamine demand (Norepinephrine μg/h vs thereby achieved MAP): Catecholamine demand decreased 10-fold (84,81 vs 8,84). Blood lactate level was divided into halves (mg/dl: 42,7 vs 20,2).
