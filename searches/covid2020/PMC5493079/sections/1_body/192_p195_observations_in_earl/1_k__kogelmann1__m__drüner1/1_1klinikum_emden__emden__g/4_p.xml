 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this case study the effects we could observe were pronounced decrease in catecholamine demand and blood lactate level. We could see increased survival if treatment with CytoSorb haemadsorption filter started between 24 – 48 h, patients who had a greater delay had poor outcome. Reasons for delay has been late acute renal failure or late admission to ICU. This implicates a therapy start not later than 24 – 48 hours.
