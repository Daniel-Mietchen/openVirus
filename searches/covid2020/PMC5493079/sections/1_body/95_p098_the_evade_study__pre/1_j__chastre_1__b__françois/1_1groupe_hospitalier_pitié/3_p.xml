 <bold>Methods:</bold> EVADE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic responses to MEDI3902 in adult ICU patients requiring MV and who are colonised with P aeruginosa in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of NP caused by P aeruginosa, proposed as a clinically meaningful, objective and reproducible endpoint. The safety of MEDI3902 will be assessed through 49 days postdose. Subjects included in the study are ICU patients aged ≥18 yrs, intubated and on MV; have LRT sample positive for P aeruginosa, but have not been diagnosed with new onset of pneumonia prior to randomization.
