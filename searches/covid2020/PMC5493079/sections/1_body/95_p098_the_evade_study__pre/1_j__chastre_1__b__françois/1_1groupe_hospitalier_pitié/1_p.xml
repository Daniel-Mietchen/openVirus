 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections in critically ill patients. The organism produces an array of factors that contribute to its virulence. Two such virulence factors are the Psl exopolysaccharide, which contributes to bacterial persistence, and the PcrV protein which contributes to the virulence of the organism. MEDI3902 is a novel bivalent, bispecific mAb that selectively binds to both factors, thereby inhibiting the cytotoxicity and immune evasion properties of the pathogen. Psl and PcrV target expression is independent of antibiotic susceptibility status; therefore, MEDI3902 also has the potential to be active against multi-drug resistant strains of P aeruginosa. MEDI3902 is being developed for the prevention of P aeruginosa pneumonia. We describe the rationale and design of the EVADE study to investigate the use of MEDI3902 in mechanically-ventilated (MV) subjects.
