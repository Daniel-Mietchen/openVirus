 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The use of math models for decision making is of great importance, it sets an objective parameter within the existing evaluations. We proposed the use of inequations, to set intervals of solution with the three points of care for ultrasound guided weaning from MV. With this the inequations propose generate an area of certainty within the proposed values an the solution intervals.
