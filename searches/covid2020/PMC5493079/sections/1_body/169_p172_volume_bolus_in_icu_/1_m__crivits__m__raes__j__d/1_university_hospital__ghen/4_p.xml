 <bold>Results:</bold> The data of one patient was excluded from analysis because of a lack of informed consent. The remaining 50 patients were included, 23 (46 %) received S, 27 PL (54 %). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics (T0) between both groups. S patients had higher Cl at T1 and T2 (110 vs. 109 mmol/L; p = 0.032 , resp. 110 vs. 108 ; p = 0.038), and higher Na at T1 (138 vs. 135 mmol/L; p = 0.034). Otherwise, no differences were noted. In addition, S patients had immediately after infusion an increase of Na (+0.4 vs. -0.8 mmol/L) , Cl (+3 vs. -1 mmol/L) (both p &lt; 0.001), and a decrease of Strong Ion Difference (SIDa) (-2.3 vs. -0.1; p &lt; 0.001), Strong Ion Gap (SIG) (-0.7 vs. +0.4; p = 0.015), and anion gap (AG) (-1.5 vs. -0.4; p = 0.018). This persisted at T2 for Cl (+2 vs. -1 mmol/L; p &lt; 0.001) and SIDa (-2.1 vs. 0.4; p = 0.018). We found no difference in UO and blood pressure.
