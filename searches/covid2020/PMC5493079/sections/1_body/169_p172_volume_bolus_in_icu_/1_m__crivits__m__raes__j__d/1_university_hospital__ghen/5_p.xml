 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Compared to Plasma-Lyte, a 1Â L fluid bolus of saline was at short term associated with a small increase of Na and Cl, and decrease in SID, SIG, and AG. These changes were statistically significant, but limited and were not associated with differences in hemodynamics or UO.
