 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Normal saline contains 154Â mmol of Na and Cl, and may therefore induce hypernatremia, hyperchloremia and acidosis. Observational studies showed that resuscitation with normal saline when compared to balanced crystalloids, is associated with acute kidney injury and death. In these studies a large volume of saline was administered. A 1 liter (L) fluid bolus is often administered in ICU patients, e.g. for hypotension or oliguria. It remains uncertain if this limited volume is also associated with adverse effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a fluid bolus of saline (S) and Plasma-Lyte (PL), a balanced crystalloid, on electrolytes, acid-base status, hemodynamics and urine output (UO).
