 <bold>Results:</bold> Results: Between January to December 2012, we studied 932 patients (60.4 % were classified as “SIRS positive”). Patients “SIRS positive” were more severily ill compared to patients “SIRS negative” (SAPS 3 of 45 [34 – 56] versus 39 [31 – 50] respectively; p &lt; 0.001) and had higher hospital mortality rates (16.9 % vs 8.1 % respectively; p &lt; 0.001). However, area under ROC curve for SAPS 3 was higher (0.81 [95 % CI 0.78 – 0.85]) than for SIRS criteria both as a dichotomous variable (0.60 [95 % IC 0.55 – 0.65]) as an ordinal variable (0.62 [95 % IC 0.57 – 0.68]; p &lt; 0.001 for comparisons between SAPS 3 and SIRS criteria).
