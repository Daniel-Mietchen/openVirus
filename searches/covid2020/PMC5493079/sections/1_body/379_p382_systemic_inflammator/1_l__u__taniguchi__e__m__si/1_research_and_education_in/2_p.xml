 <bold>Methods:</bold> Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at a private tertiary hospital (Hospital Sirio-Libanes) at São Paulo, Brazil. We extracted relevant information from the adult intensive care unit database (sistema Epimed™). A comparison was performed between SAPS 3 score model and SIRS model both as a dichotomous variable (&gt; = 2 criteria - “SIRS positive” versus 0-1 criterion - “SIRS negative”) and as an ordinal variable from 0 to 4 (according to the number of SIRS criteria met) for predicting hospital mortality. Models discriminations were compared using area under the ROC curves.
