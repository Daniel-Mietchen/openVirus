 <bold>Results:</bold> The serial change of C1INH was evaluated in 40 patients with sepsis (30 male and 10 female; 30 survivors and 10 non-survivor; mean age, 70+/-13.5 years). We divided patients into three groups such as (i) non-shock group (n = 14), (ii) non-refractory shock group (n = 13), (iii) refractory shock group (n = 13, survivors; n = 3, non survivors; n = 10). In non-shock group, C1INH were 107.3+/-26.5 % at admission and 104.2+/-22.3 % at day1, and it increased after day1 (128.1+/-26.4 % at day3, 138.3+/-21.2 % at day 7, 140.3+/-12.5 % at day 14)(p = 0.0040). In non-refractory shock group, C1INH were 113.9+/-19.2 % at admission and it increased after admission (120.2+/-23.0 % at day1, 135.7+/-19.9 % at day3, 138.8+/-17.2 % at day 7, 137.7+/-10.7 % at day 14)(p = 0.0029). In refractory shock group, C1INH were 96.7+/-15.9 % at admission and 88.9+/-22.3 % at day1 and it increased after day1 (119.8+/-39.6 % at day3, 144.4+/-21.1 % at day 7, 140.5+/-24.5 % at day 14)(p &lt; 0.0001). The difference between these three groups was statistically significant (p = 0.0039). C1INH in non-survivors did not increase significantly during their clinical course (p = 0.0773).
