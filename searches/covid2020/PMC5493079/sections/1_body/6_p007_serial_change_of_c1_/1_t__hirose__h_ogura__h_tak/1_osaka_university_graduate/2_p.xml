 <bold>Methods:</bold> This study was a single center prospective observational study. We serially examined C1INH activity values (normal range 70-130Â %) in patients with sepsis admitted into the intensive care unit of the Trauma and Acute Critical Care Center at Osaka University Hospital (Osaka, Japan) during the period between January 2014 and August 2015. We defined refractory shock as septic shock unresponsive to the conventional therapy such as adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy to maintain hemodynamics.
