<p id="Par3496">Cardiac surgery is associated with a high incidence of neurological complications, including stroke, delirium and cognitive impairment. Involved mechanisms include embolism and reduced brain flow during bypass. There are no data evaluating the impact of cardiac surgery in cerebral autoregulation and its potential relation to neurological outcomes. The aim of this prospective observational single-centre study was to evaluate the impact of cardiac surgery on dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) and assess its potential association with postoperative delirium.</p>
