<p id="Par3500">Thirty-three (23 male) patients, mean age 64.5 (SD10.9) years had data with acceptable quality.CBFV step responses at T2 were markedly different from T1 and T3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig96" ref-type="fig">96</xref>) with corresponding values of ARI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig97" ref-type="fig">97</xref>) significantly reduced at T2 (3.9 ± 1.4), compared to T1(5.7 ± 1.4) and T3 (5.4 ± 1.6) (p &lt; 0.001). We defined impaired dCA &lt; 4. Of a total of 33 patients, 19 (57 %) had impaired CA at T2 and 7 patients (21 %) at T3.Delirium was diagnosed in 8 patients; of these, 6 (31 %) had impaired dCA, compared to 2 (14 %) with normal dCA (Fisher p = 0.31). At T3, 71 % of patients with impaired dCA had delirium compared to 8 % with normal dCA (Fisher p = 0.0175).
