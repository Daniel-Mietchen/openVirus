<p id="Par3498">Adult with a EuroSCORE &gt; 6 or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with bypass were included. Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV, transcranial Doppler, middle cerebral artery), end-tidal PaCO2 (EtCO2, infrared capnograph), and blood pressure (BP, Finapres or intra-arterial) were continuously recorded supine during 5 minutes at rest pre-operatively (T1),after 24 h (T2) and 7 days after surgery (T3). Diagnosis of delirium was performed using the confusion assessment method for ICU (CAM-ICU). Autoregulation index (ARI) was estimated from CBFV response to a step change in BP derived by transfer function analysis using standard template curves. Changes in ARI at T1, T2 and T3 were assessed with repeated measures ANOVA.</p>
