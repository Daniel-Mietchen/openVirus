 <bold>Results:</bold> Stretched cells showed higher levels of IL-8 compared to non-stretched cells (198.2 ± 11.7 vs 62.0 ± 1.9 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.05). Incubation with untreated RBC products further spiked IL-8 production compared to cells that were only stretched (892.8 ± 235.8 vs 198.2 ± 11.7 pg/ml, p = 0.027). Both filtering of supernatant and depletion of microvesicles resulted in reduction in levels of IL-8, compared to samples to which untreated RBCs were added (respectively 306.6 ± 73.1 vs 340.2 ± 24.4 vs 892.8 ± 235.8 pg/ml, p = 0.02).
