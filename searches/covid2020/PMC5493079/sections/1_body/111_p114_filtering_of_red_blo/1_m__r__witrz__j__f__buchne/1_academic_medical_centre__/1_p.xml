 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is associated with acute lung injury, but the causative factor is not known. Possibly, mechanical ventilation and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion are synergistic in the induction of lung injury. We hypothesize that filtering of RBCs or depletion of RBCs from microvesicles decreases the pulmonary inflammatory reaction during mechanical ventilation.
