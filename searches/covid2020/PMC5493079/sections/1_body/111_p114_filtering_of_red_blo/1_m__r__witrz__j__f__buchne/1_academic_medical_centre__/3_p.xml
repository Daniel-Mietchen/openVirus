 <bold>Methods:</bold> Alveolar epithelial type II A549 cells were cultured on an elastic membrane and incubated with cells or supernatant from stored (35-42 days) RBC products. RBCs were optimized by filtering of the supernatant using a 0.2micron filter, or by depletion of the supernatant from microvesicles using high-speed centrifugation (N = 4 per group). Cyclic stretch of 25 % was applied to the cells for 24 hours using a cell-stretcher at 37˚C in the presence of 5 % CO2. IL-8 production was measured using ELISA. Controls are untreated products and non-stretched cells.
