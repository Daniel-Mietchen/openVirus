 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Stretching of alveolar cells and RBC transfusion have a synergistic effect on the production of IL-8. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that supernatant of RBCs contain causative agents for IL-8 production. Possibly, microvesicles are responsible for this reaction. Filtering of RBCs might be a reasonable and feasible procedure to remove microvesicles from the products.
