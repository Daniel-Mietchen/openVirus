 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The prediction of infection and its severity remains difficult in critically ill patients with suspected infection
 <sup>1</sup>. A novel, simple biomarker derived from five blood-cell derived parameters that characterize the innate immune response in routine blood samples, the intensive care infection score (ICIS), could be helpful in this respect 
 <sup>2,3</sup>. We therefore compared the predictive value of the ICIS with that of the white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) for infection and its severity in critically ill patients.
