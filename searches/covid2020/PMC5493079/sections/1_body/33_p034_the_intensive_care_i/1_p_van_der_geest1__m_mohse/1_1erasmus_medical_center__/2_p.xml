 <bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a multi-center, cluster randomized, crossover study in critically ill patients between January 2013 and September 2014. Patients with a suspected infection for which blood cultures were taken by the attending intensivist were included. Blood was taken at the same time for WBC, ICIS, CRP and PCT measurements in the study periods. Patients were divided into groups of increasing likelihood of infection and invasiveness: Group 1 without infection or with possible infection irrespective of cultures, Group 2 with probable or microbiologically proven local infection without blood stream infection (BSI) and Group 3 with BSI irrespective of local infection.
