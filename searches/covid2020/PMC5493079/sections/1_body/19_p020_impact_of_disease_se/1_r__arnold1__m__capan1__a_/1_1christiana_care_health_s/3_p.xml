 <bold>Results:</bold> 367 subjects were identified from original 759 meeting all study criteria. Frequency by disease severity: PIRO 0-4: 109 (30 %); PIRO 5-9: 191 (52 %); PIRO 10-14: 67 (18 %). There was a progressive increase in the frequency of dShock by increasing severity (37 %, 51 %, and 61 %). HBP was significantly elevated in dShock subjects across all subgroups (0-4:66 v 25; 5-9:75 v 39; 10-14:87 v 36, p &lt; 0.05). The change in HBP was significant at the high-severity subgroup (Fig.
