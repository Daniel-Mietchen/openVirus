 <bold>Methods:</bold> Design: A secondary analysis of a multi-centered observational study. Inclusion: 1. adults &gt;17 years with acute infection, 2. hospital admission and 3. two measurements of HBP. Exclusion: Hypotension within the first 12 hours. Initial PIRO scores calculated on arrival. Outcome: The development of delayed hypotension (dShock) = sBP &lt;90 after initial assessment. Analysis: Subjects were grouped according to PIRO score range using previously defined cutoffs, and outcomes for each group were summarized. Average values and change in HBP were described across each group.
