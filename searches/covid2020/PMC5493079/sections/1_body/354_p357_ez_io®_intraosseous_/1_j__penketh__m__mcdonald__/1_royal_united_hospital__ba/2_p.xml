<p id="Par3252">EZ-IO® ‘tea trolley’ training aimed to provide emergency intraosseous (IO) access teaching for time pressured hospital practitioners. Recent guidelines advocate the use of emergency IO access when intravenous access is difficult [1], as battery powered devices like the EZ-IO® allow IO access within 49 seconds [2]. Despite introductory training few use IO devices on a regular basis. There is increasing recognition that lifesaving technical skills used in emergencies but required infrequently, need regular practise to prevent ‘psychomotor skill fatigue’ [3,4].</p>
