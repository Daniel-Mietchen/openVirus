<p id="Par3254">We adopted a novel technique for technical skill training, used initially for difficult airway training [4], to train anaesthetic and ICU staff for EZ-IO® access. A theatre trolley is converted into a mobile training trolley with EZ-IO® training devices, tea and cakes. The trolley is operated by two anaesthetists and visits theatres during normal working hours: one anaesthetist takes over the care of a stable patient in theatre while the second delivers a 15 minute training session in the anaesthetic room to the listed anaesthetist and nurse/operating department practitioner (ODP). Training includes EZ-IO® device locations, all practical aspects of their use, and is followed by tea, cake and a questionnaire.</p>
