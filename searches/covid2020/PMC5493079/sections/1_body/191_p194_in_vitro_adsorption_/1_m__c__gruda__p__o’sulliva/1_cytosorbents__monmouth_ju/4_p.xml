 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study demonstrates that CytoSorbÂ® hemoadsorbent polymer beads are capable of reducing a broad range of toxic DAMPS and PAMPS from blood providing a means, in addition to cytokine reduction, of reducing the uncontrolled immune response that contributes to a maladaptive SIRS response, organ injury and death in patients with a broad range of life-threatening inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, trauma, lung injury and many others. Further study to elucidate the potential clinical impact is warranted.
