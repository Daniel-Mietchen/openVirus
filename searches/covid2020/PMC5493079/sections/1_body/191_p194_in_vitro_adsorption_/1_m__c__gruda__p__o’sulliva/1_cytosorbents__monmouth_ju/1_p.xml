 <bold>Introduction:</bold> This study quantifies the ability of CytoSorbÂ® hemoadsorbent polymer beads to adsorb a broad selection of inflammatory pathogen- and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs &amp; DAMPS) and cytokines from whole blood in an in vitro recirculation system. PAMPS cause either direct damage or trigger an immune response in the host to fight infection leading to the production of high levels of cytokines and the release of DAMPS into the bloodstream, which can trigger a maladaptive systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that can contribute to organ injury. The benefits of cytokine reduction using extracorporeal blood filtration with hemoadsorbant porous polymer beads has been demonstrated in septic animals, yet the adsorption of other toxins and inflammatory factors may also contribute to the observed benefits.
