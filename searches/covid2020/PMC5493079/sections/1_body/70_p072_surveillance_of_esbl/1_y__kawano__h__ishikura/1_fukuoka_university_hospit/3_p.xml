 <bold>Results:</bold> Of the 1,245 patients who were admitted to our ICU during the study period, we identified 670 patients (phase 1) and 575 patients (phase 2) respectively. The rates of patients either infected or colonized with ESBL-E were significantly higher in phase 2 than phase 1 (3 % versus 12.3 %, p &lt; 0.05). However, the AUD values for fluoroquinolones (6.8 versus 10.4 defined daily doses/1,000 bed-days, p = 0.27), third-generation cephalosporins (19.9 versus 33.3 defined daily doses/1000 bed-days, p = 0.36), tazobactam/ piperacillin (48 versus 50.7 defined daily doses/1000 bed-days, p = 0.55), and carbapenems (27.3 versus 60.3 defined daily doses/1,000 bed-days, p = 0.06) were not significantly different in each subphase. Moreover ICU mortality (17.9 % versus 16.1 %, p = 0.3) was also not found to differ significantly in the different phases of the study.
