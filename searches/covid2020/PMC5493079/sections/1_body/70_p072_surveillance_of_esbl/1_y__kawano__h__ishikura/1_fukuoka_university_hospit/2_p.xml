 <bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the ICU of Fukuoka University Hospital from April 2013 to September 2014. The occurrence of infections or colonization with ESBL-E, the antimicrobial use density (AUD) values, and the clinical outcome were investigated for the described periods, and those parameters were compared between April-December 2013 (phase 1) and January-September 2014 (phase 2). Moreover, we routinely performed stool cultures for ESBL-E in phase 2.
