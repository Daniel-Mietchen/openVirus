 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) strains are considered to be important, since few antibiotics currently remain active against these bacteria. However, the implications associated with the surveillance of fecal carriers of ESBL-E among ICU patients are unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of carrying out stool screening for ESBL-E.
