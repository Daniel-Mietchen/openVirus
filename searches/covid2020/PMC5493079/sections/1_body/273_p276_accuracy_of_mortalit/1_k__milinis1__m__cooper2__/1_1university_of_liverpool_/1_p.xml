 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a distinct syndrome from acute liver failure (ALF) characterised by acute decompensation, organ failure and high short-term mortality (50Â %) [1]. Several novel measures (Consortium Liver Failure-SOFA (CLIF-SOFA) and Royal Free Hospital (RFH) scores) have been specifically developed to predict mortality in ACLF, however their validity has not been assessed in ALF [1]. The aim of this study is to compare the performance of mortality prediction models in ALF and ACLF in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.
