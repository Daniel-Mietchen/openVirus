 <bold>Results:</bold> 220 patients were included in the study (ACLF = 118, ALF = 102). The main aetiology of cirrhosis in ACLF group was alcohol (91.5 %). The leading causes of ALF were paracetamol overdose (48 %), alcoholic hepatitis (31.4 %) and viral hepatitis (11.8 %). ACLF patients were significantly more likely to have longer stay (median 6 vs. 3 days, p &lt; 0.005) and higher risk of dying (54.2 % vs. 33.7 %, χ &lt;0.05). In general, the scoring systems performed better in ALF (AUROC values: CLIF-OF 0.77; CLIF-ACLF 0.79; RFH 0.80; MELD 0.80; APACHEII 0.76) compared to ACLF (AUROC values: CLIF-OF 0.68; CLIF-ACLF 0.68; RFH 0.72; APACHEII 0.65; MELD 0.71). Calibration of the models was acceptable across the both groups, except for APACHEII in ALF patients (χ =14.2, p &lt; 0.05).
