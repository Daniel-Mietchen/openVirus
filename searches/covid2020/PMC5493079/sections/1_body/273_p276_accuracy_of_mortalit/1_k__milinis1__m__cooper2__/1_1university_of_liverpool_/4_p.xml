 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Mortality and morbidity is higher in ACLF compared to ALF. Prediction models developed in ACLF populations perform even better in ALF. This could be possibly explained by relatively few comorbidities in ALF. In our patient cohort, the highest accuracy was achieved using RHF and MELD scores rather than CLIF-SOFA based measures.
