 <bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective data were collected on patients admitted with liver failure to ICU between 2008 and 2014. Demographic, clinical and biochemical parameters were recorded on admission to ICU. The main outcome was death in ICU. The scores were calculated for CLIF-Organ failure (CLIF-C OF, a shortened version of CLIF-SOFA), CLIF-ACLF (includes age and white cell count), RFH, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II). Accuracy and calibration of the scoring systems were assessed using area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) and goodness-of-fit Ï‡ respectively.
