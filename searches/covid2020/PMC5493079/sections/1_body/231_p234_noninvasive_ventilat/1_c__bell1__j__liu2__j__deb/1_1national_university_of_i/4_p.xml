 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Two thirds of patients with haematologic malignancy and acute respiratory failure required ETI following NIV failure and had a high subsequent mortality. Patients who fail NIV have higher PaCO2, higher FiO2 and more vasopressor use. Use of NIV may be associated with delayed diagnostic bronchoscopy.
