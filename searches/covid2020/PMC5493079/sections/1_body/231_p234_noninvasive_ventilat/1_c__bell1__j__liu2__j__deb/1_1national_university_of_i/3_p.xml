 <bold>Results:</bold> 79 patients (32 females, 56 ± 14 yrs, APACHE II 27.6 ± 4.6) with haematologic malignancy were treated with NIV for acute respiratory failure. 76 % of patients had acute leukaemia, 10 % had lymphoma, and 14 % had chronic leukaemia, multiple myeloma or myelodysplastic syndrome. Aetiology of respiratory failure was multifactorial in 39 % patients, with features of pneumonia in 77 % patients, severe sepsis or septic shock in 42 %, and pulmonary oedema in 30 %. 57 % of patients failed NIV and required ETI, 8 % had a do-not-intubate (DNI) order and died following NIV failure, and 35 % avoided ETI. Compared with patients who avoided ETI, those who failed NIV were more likely to have acute leukaemia (84 % vs 61 %, p = 0.019) and at baseline had higher PaCO2 (39 vs 30, p = 0.038), higher FIO2 (0.6 vs 0.4, p = 0.002), and more vasopressor use (31 % vs 11 %, p = 0.059). Only one patient had a diagnostic bronchoscopy while treated with NIV and 25 (55 %) had bronchoscopy within 1 day following ETI. Of the 44 patients who failed NIV and required ETI, (68 %) died in the ICU. Overall ICU mortality of this cohort was 41 % and 3-month mortality was 57 %.
