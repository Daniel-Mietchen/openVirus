 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is commonly used as a first line therapy for immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure, although it may not be appropriate for every patient. Failure of NIV is an independent predictor of mortality and delayed endotracheal intubation may worsen prognosis. We report our centerâ€™s experience and outcomes for patients with active haematologic malignancy treated with NIV.
