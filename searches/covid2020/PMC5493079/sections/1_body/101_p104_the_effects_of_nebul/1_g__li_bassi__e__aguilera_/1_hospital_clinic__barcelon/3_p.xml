 <bold>Results:</bold> Upon autopsy, lungs weighed 732 ± 320gr in the control group, 546 ± 89gr in the AF, 560 ± 83gr in the A group, 519 ± 53gr in the F, 480 ± 85gr in AF + Mero and 537 ± 80gr in the Mero group (p = 0.591). As depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>, P.aeruginosa concentration in lung tissue varied among groups (p &lt; 0.001). In particular, in the AF + Merop group, the highest bactericidal efficacy was achieved.
