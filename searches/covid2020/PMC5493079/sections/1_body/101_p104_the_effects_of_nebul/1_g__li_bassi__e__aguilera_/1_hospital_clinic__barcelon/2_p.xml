 <bold>Methods:</bold> Seventeen pigs (31.8 ± 1.9 Kg) were anesthetized and on MV for 78 hours. Multi-lobar pneumonia was developed by P. aeruginosa (1), resistant to amikacin (A), fosfomycin (F) and susceptible to meropenem (Mero). Following clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, animals were randomized to receive the following treatments: nebulized saline (control); nebulized AF; nebulized A; nebulized F; nebulized AF with Mero administered IV; Mero alone. Nebulization was performed through an in-line vibrating mesh nebulizer (PARI GmbH, Germany). Upon autopsy, lungs were weighed and the lobes biopsied for P.aeruginosa quantification.
