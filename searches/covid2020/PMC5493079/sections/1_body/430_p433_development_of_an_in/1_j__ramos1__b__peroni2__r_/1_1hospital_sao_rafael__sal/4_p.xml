 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This ICU admission triage tool demonstrated good reliability, validity and predictive characteristics. However, it may not be suitable to standard practice, yet, since it was not properly evaluated to demonstrate a difference in benefit of ICU admission, justifying the admission of one priority stratum over the others. Further prospective studies with additional collected variables should be implemented to address its limitations.
