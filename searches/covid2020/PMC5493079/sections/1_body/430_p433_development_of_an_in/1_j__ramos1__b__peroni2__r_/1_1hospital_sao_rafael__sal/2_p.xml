 <bold>Methods:</bold> An algorithm based on responses to an ICU request form was developed to classify patients in each of four SCCMâ€™s priority strata. Nine physicians with experience in critical care or emergency medicine evaluated forty clinical vignettes for reliability analyzes. The correlation of algorithm-based priorities with surrogate gold standards, defined by a panel of specialists, was evaluated in a validity analysis. Validity was further evaluated by applying this algorithm to a retrospective sample of 603 patients with requests for ICU admission, for association with outcomes.
