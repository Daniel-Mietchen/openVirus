 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Intensive care unit (ICU) admission triage is performed routinely in ICUs of developed and developing countries and is often based solely on clinical judgement, which could mask unethical prejudice or bias. Therefore, development of an objective triage score and of guidelines applying to individual patients has been discussed in the literature. To help triage decisions for ICU admission, a critical care team was assembled to come up with an instrument to aid triage decisions, based on the Society of Critical Care Medicineâ€™s (SCCM) guidelines. We sought to evaluate the validity and reliability of this instrument.
