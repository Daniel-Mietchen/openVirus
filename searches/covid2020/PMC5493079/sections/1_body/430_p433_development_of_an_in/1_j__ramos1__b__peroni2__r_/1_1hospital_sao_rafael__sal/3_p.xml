 <bold>Results:</bold> Overall agreement was substantial, with a weighted kappa of 0.61 (95% CI 0.57-0.65). Algorithm-based priorities were also correlated with the priorities ascribed by specialists, with a weighted kappa of 0.67 (95% CI 0.60-0.74) and with subjective assessments of appropriateness of ICU admission. Algorithm-based priorities were also associated with ICU admission and hospital mortality (priorities 1,2, 3 and 4 had hospital mortality rates of 35.5%, 27.6%, 46.1% and 66.1%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). However, in an unadjusted analysis, there was no differential mortality benefit of ICU admission in each priority stratum.
