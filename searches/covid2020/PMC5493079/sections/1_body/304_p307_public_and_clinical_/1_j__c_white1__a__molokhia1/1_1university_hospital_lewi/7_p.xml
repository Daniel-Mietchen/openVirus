<p id="Par2752">Compared to the national figure of 45.6 % for initial CPR survival, the public predicted the correct survival range more accurately (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig81" ref-type="fig">81</xref>) [1]. Staff results were more comparable to their local hospital data. Hospital A’s initial survival rate was 33 %: 15 % of staff compared to 6.6 % of public chose the correct survival range. In hospital B, every doctor underestimated the initial CPR survival figure (55 %). Nurses were closer to the figure with the most popular response range being 30-40 % compared to 10-20 % for doctors. GPs were most pessimistic at predicting general CPR survival rates and nurses were most optimistic.
