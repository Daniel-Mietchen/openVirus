<p id="Par3209">The cardiac Troponin test has a key role in the diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Over utilization and inappropriate requests for it have created a heavy workload for laboratory staff, increased costs to the health care system, and unnecessarily increased the length of stay and costs for patients. The aim of this study was to make and standardize all requests of Troponin more accurate and scientific without causing any burden to the patients, doctors or laboratory section.</p>
