 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this clinical setting, a cut-off value of 12500 AB/C on day 1-2 was associated with a high NPV for secondary sepsis. The mHLA-DR levels were lower in patients who acquired secondary sepsis. The aetiology of sepsis was associated with differences in mHLA-DR dynamics with the lowest initial values and greatest recovery demonstrated for [i]S.pneumoniae[/i]
