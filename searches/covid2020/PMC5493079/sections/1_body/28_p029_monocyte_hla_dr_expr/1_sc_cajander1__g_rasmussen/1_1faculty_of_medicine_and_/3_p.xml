 <bold>Results:</bold> Secondary sepsis occurred in 7 cases. The mHLA-DR levels on day 1-2 were significantly lower for cases who developed secondary sepsis; median 8990 vs. 18200 AB/C (p = 0.009), AUC 0.798. The negative predictive value (NPV) was 98 %, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 22 %. The three most prevalent pathogens demonstrated differences in linear association over time, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The mean mHLA-DR increased significantly to day 7 for [i]S.pneumoniae[/i]. A modest increase was seen for [i]S.aureus[/i].
