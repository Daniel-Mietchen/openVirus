 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Sepsis induced immunosuppression is an important risk factor for unfavourable outcome in severe sepsis. The monocyte HLA-DR expression (mHLA-DR) is suggested as a useful biomarker for immunosuppression. In this prospective study of bacteremic sepsis we aimed to; 1) assess the predictive value of mHLA-DR for secondary sepsis, and 2) compare mHLA-DR levels and dynamics of patients with different bacteremic aetiology of sepsis.
