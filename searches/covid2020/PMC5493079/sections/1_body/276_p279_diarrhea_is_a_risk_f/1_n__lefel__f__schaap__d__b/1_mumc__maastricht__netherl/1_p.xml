 <bold>Introduction:</bold> We hypothesize that diarrhea can lead to intestinal failure associated liver disease (IFALD) in critical illness. Risk factors for liver injury in the ICU include toxicity of drugs and TPN, but etiology often remains unknown. Currently, there is emerging interest in the relation between intestinal failure and liver injury. The occurrence of IFALD is mostly attributed to the use of TPN in patients with intestinal failure, but recent data suggest that interruption of the enterohepatic cycle also may be an important cause. Diarrhea induces nutrient malabsorption but may also impair reabsorption of bile acids and disturbance of the gut-liver axis. Along this line of reasoning diarrhea may be a hitherto unidentified risk factor for liver injury through the development of IFALD.
