 <bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to our ICU from September 2014 until February 2015. Markers of liver injury and other clinical and biochemical parameters were recorded on the day diarrhea (&gt;250 ml/day) developed (median at the 2d day of ICU admission) and 2 days thereafter. In patients without diarrhea data were recorded at the day of ICU admission and 2 days later. Patients with liver injury (defined as an elevation of serum y-glutamyltransferase or alkaline phosphatase levels above reference values) on admission or at the moment diarrhea occurred were excluded. 79 patients remained for analysis (19 with liver injury). Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for liver injury.
