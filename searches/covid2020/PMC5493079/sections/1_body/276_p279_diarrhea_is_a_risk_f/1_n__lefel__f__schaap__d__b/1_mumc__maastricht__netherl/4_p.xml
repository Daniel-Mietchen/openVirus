 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Diarrhea is an independent risk factor for the development of liver injury in the ICU. This supports the hypothesis that disturbance of the liver-gut axis due to diarrhea and bile salt malabsorption in ICU patients should be regarded as a manifestation of intestinal failure, potentially leading to intestinal failure associated liver disease. Future research should be aimed at unraveling mechanisms of IFALD in ICU patients and at interventions limiting malabsorption or its consequences for intestinal-hepatic bile salt signaling.
