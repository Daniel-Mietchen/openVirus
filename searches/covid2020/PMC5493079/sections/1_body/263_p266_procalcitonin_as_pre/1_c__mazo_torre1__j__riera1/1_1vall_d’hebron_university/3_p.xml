 <bold>Results:</bold> Procalcitonin at 24 h were associated with PaO2/FIO2 over the first 72 h and the severity of PGD at 72 h after LT (procalcitonin at 24 h of patients with grade 0-2 PGD were different from those patients with grade 3 PGD) (p &lt; 0.01). PCT levels at 24 h was higher from the 9 patients who died, (p = 0.02), AUC = 0.74 predict ICU-mortality. Procalcitonin and interleukin-10 at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h were correlated with the FEV1 one year after LT. Interleukin-10 at 48 h, also were correlated with the FVC one year after LT
