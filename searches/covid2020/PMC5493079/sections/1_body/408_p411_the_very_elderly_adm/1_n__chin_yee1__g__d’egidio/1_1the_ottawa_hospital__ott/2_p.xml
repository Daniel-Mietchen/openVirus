 <bold>Methods:</bold> This multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study included patients &gt; =80 years old admitted to 22 Canadian ICUs from 2009-2013. Overall cost of care per patient was determined by length of stay and direct-variable costs for ICU admission. Using both univariate and logistic regression models, we investigated potentially predictive factors influencing cost, including patient outcome (death vs. survival), frailty, residence in a nursing home, as well as the presence of advance directives. An exploratory analysis was performed to illustrate the potential cost savings of reducing the number of ICU admissions in this population.
