 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this study, we will demonstrate the significant economic costs of critical care in very elderly patients admitted to ICUâ€”a population for whom this level of care is often unwanted or futile. More importantly, we expect to illustrate the potential cost savings of reducing these admissions, which will be crucial for informing clinical and policymaking decisions.
