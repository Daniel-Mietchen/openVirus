 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Many elderly patients are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) despite known poor outcomes and frequent patient preference to avoid unnecessary prolongation of life. The REALISTIC-80 (Realities, Expectations and Attitudes to LIfe Support Technologies in Intensive Care for Octogenarians) trial studied the outcomes of very elderly patients admitted to ICUs in Canada. Not only was mortality high, but long-term physical and functional recovery was also poor, raising questions about the appropriateness of ICU admission in this group. These findings also carry significant economic implications. Using data from REALISTIC-80 trial, we examined the cost of ICU admission for the very elderly, factors affecting this cost, and the potential savings of reducing admissions that are either undesired by the patient or medically futile.
