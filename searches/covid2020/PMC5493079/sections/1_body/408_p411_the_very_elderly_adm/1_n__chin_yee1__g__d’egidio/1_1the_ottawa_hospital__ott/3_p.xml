 <bold>Results:</bold> In total, 3,064 patients &gt; =80 years old were admitted to ICU, of which 1,917 were eligible, and 610 were enrolled in the study. The average age was 84 years; median length of stay was 5 days in ICU and 21 days in hospital. Mortality was 14% in ICU, 26% in hospital and 41% at 12 months. For non-survivors, the median time from admission to death was 12 days. Of enrolled patients, 240 (39%) remained in ICU for 7 days or more; 99 (41%) of these died in hospital. At 1 year, 28% of patients had meaningful recovery measured by the Short Form-36, a survey of general health status that includes both physical and mental health component scales. The results of the cost analysis are pending and will be presented at the conference.
