 <bold>Methods:</bold> Physicians were electronically invited to respond an online questionnaire. The study was a factorial 2x2 trial and each respondent was randomized to increased or no increased cognitive load and to different versions of the vignettes. Cognitive load was simulated by distracting videos, sounds and time-limit for response. Clinical vignettes were based on real patients for whom ICU admission was requested. Archetypical vignettes for ICU admission or refusal were defined based on experts opinion. Six groups of vignettes were constructed: 1)single archetypical for admission; 2)two simultaneous archetypical for admission; 3)single archetypical for refusal; 4)two simultaneous archetypical for refusal; 5)single non-archetypical vignette. Each of these groups were randomly presented in an ICU scarcity (last bed available) or non-scarcity setting. Group 6 vignettes were randomly presented in two versions: 6.1 consisted in a “multiple choice” vignette in which the respondent was presented with the decision to admit an archetypical case for ICU admission or an elective surgery patient; 6.2 consisted in a “status quo” vignette, in which the last ICU bed was already reserved for an elective surgery patient and the respondent was presented with two simultaneous ICU requests for archetypical cases for ICU admission.
