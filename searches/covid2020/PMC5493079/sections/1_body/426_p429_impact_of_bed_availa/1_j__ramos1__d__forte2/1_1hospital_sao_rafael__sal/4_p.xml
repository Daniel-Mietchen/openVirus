 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> There was no impact of cognitive load on the responses, but the results may have been hampered by the differential dropout rate. ICU scarcity was associated with increased refusal of patients for whom ICU admission was deemed inappropriate, but not with refusal of patients for whom ICU admission was deemed appropriate. Multiple-choice bias had more impact than status quo bias in the inappropriate refusal of ICU admission.
