 <bold>Results:</bold> 159 physicians logged in and were randomized and 106 (67%) had complete data. Completion rate was lower for the cognitive load group (56% vs 79%, p &lt; 0.05), but there were no differences on demographic characteristics. Cognitive load had no impact on the proportion of cases admitted or refused in each group. Group 3 vignettes were more often refused admission in ICU scarcity setting (68% vs 45%, p &lt; 0.05). Archetypical vignettes for admission were more often refused in group 6.1 (multiple-choice) than group 6.2 (status quo): 20.4% vs 1.8%, p &lt; 0.05.
