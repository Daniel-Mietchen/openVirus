 <bold>Results:</bold> All patients initiated on PRVC or SIMV should have their anthropometric measurement of ulnar length or actual height recorded. It was found only 35.5 % of patients admitted had these recorded as opposed to the local guideline of 100 %. 50 % had documented IBW with 16.9 % of those not having a recorded optimal TV based on 6 ml/kg. Of the 45 patients who had documented IBW appropriate TV calculated, 62 % were commenced on TV greater than their calculated optimal TV. Every patient’s arterial oxygen saturations were to be maintained between 88-92 %. Only 10.3 % of patients met this standard, although 95.4 % of patients maintained saturations greater than 88 %.
