 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Over 60Â % of patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) will require Endotracheal Tube (ETT) intubation and mechanical ventilation[1]. The aim was to perform an audit of ventilation regimes in critically ill patients admitted to Whiston Hospital. Its main objectives were to evaluate the current management of ventilated patients on ICU at Whiston hospital in comparison to the current local standards of best practice, with the main emphasis surrounding IBW (Ideal Body Weight) documentation and reduction in initial tidal volume (TV) from traditional guidelines.
