 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Metabolic alkalosis (MA) represents up to half of all acid-base disturbances in hospitalized patients and it is important to know that if it is interact with the noninvasive ventilation (NIV) therapy in hypercapnic respiratory failure. Because of the frequent diuretic and steroid usage lots of hypercapnic patients with COPD and heart failure requiring NIV are also at risk for MA and it may cause hypoventilation. While many reasons of NIV failure have been studied and defined extensively MA as a reason of NIV failure has not been investigated in hypercapnic respiratory failure yet. The aim of this study is to assess if MA influence NIV success and intensive care unit (ICU) outcome in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure and receiving NIV therapy.
