 <bold>Results:</bold> Sixty one of 206 (30 %) patients developed MA at 3rd day and this group were older, more obese, had heart failure and used loop diuretics more often than the other group Lenght of NIV, ICU, hospital stay were longer in MA group than the non-MA group (p:0.024, 0.006, 0.001 respectively). Arterial blood gas values at the day of MA was pH: 7.45 PaO2: 71 mmHg, PaCO2: 58 mmHg HCO3:41 meq. Admission diagnosis of heart failure increased development of MA risk 3.4 times (OR:3,4 (CI 95 %:1,6-7) p:0,001). 190 mg of furosemid dose determined as cutt of point for the development of MA (AUC = 0,782 p &lt; 0,001, sensitivity 68 %, specifity 80 %). Duration of NIV was significantly longer in patients with MA but it was independent risk factor for only hospital stay longer than 10 days (OR:3.4, CI95%:1,7-6,8), p &lt; 0.0001).
