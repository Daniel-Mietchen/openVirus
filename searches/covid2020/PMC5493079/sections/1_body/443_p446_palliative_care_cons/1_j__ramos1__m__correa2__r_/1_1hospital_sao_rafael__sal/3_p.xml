 <bold>Results:</bold> There were 2476 ICU admission requests and 949 palliative care consultation requests. Of the formers, 179 (7%) were ICU and PAL. These patients, when compared to ICUnoPAL, were older (65 vs 54 years, p &lt; 0.05), with more severe disease, as measured by MPMII0 score (0,40 vs 0,26, p &lt; 0.05), less likely to be admitted to the ICU (49% vs 64%, p &lt; 0.05) and had higher adjusted hospital mortality (83% vs 37%; OR [95%CI]: 7,2 [4,6-11,4]). There were 29 (16%) patients PALbefICU and 150 (84%) PALaftICU. When comparing these two groups, there were no differences in MPMII0 score, organ dysfunctions or use of artificial life support at the moment of ICU request. PALbefICU patients were hospitalized for fewer days before PC consultation request (8 vs 29 days, p &lt; 0.05), were more likely to have no diagnosis at the moment of consultation (10% vs 0%, p &lt; 0.05) and presented less frequently with palliative performance scale (PPS) lower than 30 (56% vs 85%, p &lt; 0.05). More patients had PC consultations discontinued in the PALbefICU group (41% vs 20%, p &lt; 0.05) and the main reason for discontinuation was the absence of indication for exclusive palliative care (31% vs 6%, p &lt; 0.05). However, PALbefICU patients were less likely to be admitted in the ICU (31% vs 53%, p &lt; 0.05) and hospital mortality was similar in both groups (88% vs 82%, p &lt; 0.05), both adjusted for severity of illness.
