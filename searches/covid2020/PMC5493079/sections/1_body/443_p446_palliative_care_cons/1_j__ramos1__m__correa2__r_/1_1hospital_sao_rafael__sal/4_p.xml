 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Co-occurrence of ICU admission request and PC consultation in the same hospitalization was frequent and PC consultation before ICU request was associated with a lower chance of ICU admission. These patients had extremely high hospital mortality, despite differences in timing of consultation, diagnosis, PPS and definition of life support limitation. This data seems to support the notion that clinical deterioration during hospitalization may be seen as an opportunity to discuss end of life goals.
