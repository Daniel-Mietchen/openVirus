 <bold>Introductions:</bold> The risk assessment of cardiac troponin and other cardiac biomarkers in end-stage renal disease is not equivalent where clinical decision making in patients with renal diseases based on cardiac biomarkers needs justification in relation to patient management or outcomes [1]. Long-term outcome could be influenced by acute kidney injury (AKI) in cardiac surgery [2], but cardiac troponins need exploration in theses settings. We aim at assessing the diagnostic performance of high sensitive troponin T (hsTnT) in the settings of cardiac surgery-induced AKI.
