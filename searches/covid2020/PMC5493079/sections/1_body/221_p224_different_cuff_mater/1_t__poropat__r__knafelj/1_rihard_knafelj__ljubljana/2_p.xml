 <bold>Methods:</bold> 10 porcine tracheas were intubated with different cuff shape/materials. Barrel and tappered shaped cuffs made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyurethane (POLY) were tested. Following intubation cuffs were filled with air (25 cmH2O cuff pressure). 3 mL of methylene blue (1%water solution) with iodine contrast (Iomeron 300) was instiled in trachea. Same protocol was applied using 20 mL syringes instead of tracheas. After 1 and 24 h visual confirmation and CT 3D reconstruction was performed to evaluate distal tracheal leakage.
