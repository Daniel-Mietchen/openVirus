 <bold>Results:</bold> The median age of the subjects was 67 years (range: 18-93), and 71.7 % of them were male. The median lengths of their stay in the ICU and the hospital were 15 (range: 4-129) and 26 (range: 5-430) days, respectively. The ICU and hospital mortality rates were 43.7 and 44.4 %, respectively, and the 28-day mortality rate after the ICU admission was 34.7 %. The median WIC was 2 (range: 0-11), and there was a significant difference in the WICs of the non-survivors and survivors (p &lt; 0.05). The linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between the WIC and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores on the admission day (p &lt; 0.05). The receiver operating characteristics curve indicated a WIC of 3 as the cut-off value [area under the curve, 0.593; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.525-0.661; and p &lt; 0.05], and the subjects with a WIC greater than 3 had a higher mortality rate (44.5 % vs. 28.6 %, p &lt; 0.05). The univariate logistic regression analysis showed that a WIC ¡Ã 3 was independently associated with 28-day mortality in our population (odds ratio, 2.0; 95 % CI, 1.240-3.226; and p &lt; 0.05).
