 <bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective, observational study was performed on inpatients that required a Rapid Response Team (RRT) consultation. 24-hour holter monitoring and serial measurements of physiological and biochemical data were made. Heart rate variability was measured as time domains measured over 24Â hours (SDNN, ASDNN, rMSSD, pNN50%, SDANN, mean NN) and frequency domains measured hourly (Very Low Frequency VLF, Low Frequency LF, High Frequency HF, Low/High ratio). The Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (RAC No. 2151069).
