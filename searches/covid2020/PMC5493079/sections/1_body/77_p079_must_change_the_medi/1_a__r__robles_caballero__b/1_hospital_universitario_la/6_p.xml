 <bold>Results:</bold> Since the formation of the GEO, number of new carbapenem-resistant cases decreased drastically. Three new cases were reported on February, two cases on March and one on April. Since May, the cases of colonization by carbapenem resistant bacteria within the ICU have been reduced to those cases imported from other units; there have been exceptional cases generated on the unit. In these ones the failure of defense was identified, reported, and measures were taken for further occasions.
