 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Urinary tract infections are common problems in patients in ICU with increased mortality, costs and hospitalization. The best way to treat urinary tract infections is to prevent them. The mechanism of action for preventing bacterial adhesion for noble metal alloy-coated urinary catheter is the generation of a galvanic effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of noble metal coated-catheter compared to silicone Foley catheter in patients admitted to our Toxicology-Intensive Care Unit for drug poisoning, with short-term catheterization.
