 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Noble metal alloy-coated catheters may decrease the incidence of urinary tract infections compared with silicon ones and in the meantime may lower the need for antibiotics. Also, we noticed that the incidence of bacteriuria increased with age in both groups, but remained lower in noble metal alloy-coated catheter group.
