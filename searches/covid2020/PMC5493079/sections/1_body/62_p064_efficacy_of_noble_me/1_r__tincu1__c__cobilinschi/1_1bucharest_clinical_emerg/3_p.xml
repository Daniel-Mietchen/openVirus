 <bold>Results:</bold> The incidence of bacteriuria was 2 % with the noble metal alloy-coated catheter and 6.6 % with the silicone catheter (p &lt; 0.05) after a mean period of 3 days’ catheterization time. Age over 65 years (odds ratio 6.08) was significant risk factors for bacteriuria. The Gram negative bacteria of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most uropathogenic bacteria. We observed significant association between urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli and female gender (p &lt; 0.05).
