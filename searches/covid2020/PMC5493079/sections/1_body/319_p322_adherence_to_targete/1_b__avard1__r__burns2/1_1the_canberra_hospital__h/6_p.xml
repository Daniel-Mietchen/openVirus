<p id="Par2913">Only 16 % of patients achieved target temperature within 4 hours, with 25 % still not achieving target within 16 hours of ROSC and 44 % were maintained at the target for 12-24 hours. The target was chosen as 32-24 degrees in 73 % of patients. Rewarming occurred at a a rate of &lt;0.5 degrees per hour in less than 50 % of the patients.
