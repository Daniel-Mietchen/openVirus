 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Noninvasive ventilation(NIV) is practically used for patients with acute exacerbation of COPD(AECOPD) with acute respiratory failure(ARF). Several new modes of NIV are currently provided for ventilatory assistance, however it is not known what the best one is. Theoretically, neurally adjusted ventilatory assist(NAVA) improves asynchrony and preserves natural breathing [1], which might benefit to dynamic hyperinflation.
