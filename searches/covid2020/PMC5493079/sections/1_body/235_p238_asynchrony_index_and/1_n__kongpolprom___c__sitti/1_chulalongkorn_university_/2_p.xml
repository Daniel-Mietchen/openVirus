 <bold>Methods:</bold> A pilot crossover study comparing asynchrony index and breathing patterns between AECOPD patients assisted with NIV-PS and those assisted with NIV-NAVA was conducted. AECOPD patients with ARF using NIV-PS were recruited. The clinically stable patients were randomly ventilated with NIV-PS or NIV-NAVA for 30Â minutes, and then switched to the other mode after a wash-out period. One patient could be enrolled more than 1 comparative sequences. Breathing patterns, 6 types of asynchrony and electrical diaphragmatic activity(EAdi) were continuously recorded during the 20 last-minute periods. Continuous data were reported as medians (IQR) or means (SD) and compared by using unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U test.
