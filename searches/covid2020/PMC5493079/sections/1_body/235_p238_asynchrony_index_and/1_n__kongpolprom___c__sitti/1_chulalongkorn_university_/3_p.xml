 <bold>Results:</bold> Three AECOPD patients were allocated to seven comparative sequences. NIV-NAVA tended to decrease % asynchrony index: 12.88(3.33, 21.95)% in PS VS 2.62(0.85, 11.57)% in NAVA, p = 0.13. NIV-NAVA significantly reduced trigger-delay(Td) : Td in PS 9 (6.75, 20.75) ms VS Td in NAVA 3 (1,6.5) ms, p = 0.017,and improved ineffective triggering: 1.03(1.8) events/minute in PS VS 0(0) event/minute in NAVA, p = 0.026. Moreover, assistance with NIV-NAVA tended to deliver lower tidal volume(Vt) with higher Vt variability: mean Vt 8.91(2.7) ml/Kg with CV 28.42 during PS VS mean Vt 6.81(1.85) ml/Kg with CV 38.45 during NAVA. In contrast, the similarity of respiratory rate (RR) and EAdi variability was observed: RR 21.44(2.75) /minute with CV13.25 in PS VS 22.7(4.11) /minute with CV10.04 in NAVA and EAdi 22.17(14.42) μV. with CV 46.40 in PS VS 17.02(11.02) μV. with CV 45.87 in NAVA, respectively.
