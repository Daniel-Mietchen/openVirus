 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Comparing the two groups, we noticed both starting from a similar baseline cardiac function. During the neurovegetative storm, we recorded a similar myocardial stunning. However, in group who used substitution hormonotherapy is shown a recovery of systolic function to almost basal level within 12Â hours after brain death while in the control group remains a dysfunction in systolic function. Considering these pts as potential heart donors we have shown that substitution hormonotherapy improves systolic function, despite the stunning post neurovegetative storm.
