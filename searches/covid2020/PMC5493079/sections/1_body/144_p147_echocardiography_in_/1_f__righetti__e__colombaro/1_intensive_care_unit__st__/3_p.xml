 <bold>Results:</bold> Pts in the two groups were statistically matched for sex (p = 0.28) and age (p = 0.37). All patients have evolved in brain death. In Hormonotherapy group baseline ejection fraction was 54 % ± 3%, 28 % ± 8% post neurovegetative storm, and 43 % ± 6% within 12 hours after brain death. In the control group the baseline ejection fraction was 49 % ± 7%, post neurovegetative storm 25 % ± 6%, and 34 % ± 5% within 12 hours after brain death. Comparing the two groups we have reached statistical significance (p = 0.028).
