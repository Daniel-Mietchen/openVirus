 <bold>Methods:</bold> 40 adult patients(pts), admitted to the intensive care unit with acute brain injury, bilateral non reactive mydriasis, Glasgow Coma Scale 3, absence of any reflection and potential progression to brain death. Pts were divided randomly into two groups: Hormonotherapy group (20 pts) treated with substitution hormonotherapy (triiodothyronine, vasopressin, methylprednisolone, insulin) and Control group (20 pts) with standard treatment. In all pts serial transesofageal echocardiography evaluations were performed with focus on systolic function, evaluated with ejection fraction of the left ventricle with Simpson’s method. The echocardiographic exams were performed at entrance of the pts, post neurovegetative storm and within 12 hours after diagnosis brain death. The results were expressed as mean with standard deviation. For the comparison between the two groups was used the Fisher test considered significant with p ≤ 0.05.
