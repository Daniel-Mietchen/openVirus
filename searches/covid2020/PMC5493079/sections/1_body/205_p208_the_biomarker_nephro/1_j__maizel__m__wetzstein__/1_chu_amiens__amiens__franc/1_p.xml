 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Patients hospitalized for septic shock have an increased risk to develop acute renal failure (ARF) and require a renal replacement therapy (RRT). The best delay to start RRT is a matter of debate. A new urine test, the Nephrocheck
 <sup>TM</sup> has been validated. It corresponds to the urine concentration product of 2 tubular suffering markers (TIMP2 and IGFBP7) associated with a risk of developing an ARF within 12Â hours. The aim of our study was to analyze the capacity of the urine TIMP2*IGFBP7 to predict the absence of evolution toward the AKIN 3 in patients hospitalized for a septic shock who present an ARF AKIN 1 or 2.
