 <bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-seven patients were included, 20 (35 %) patients developed an AKIN 3 ARF (group AKIN = 3) and 37 patients did not reach this level (AKIN &lt; 3). At H0, the urine output was lower n the AKIN &lt; 3 (0.69 (0.47-0.99)) versus AKIN = 3 (0.33 (0.16-0.58)ml/h/kg, p = 0.007). There was no difference for the other variables at baseline including creatininemia. The TIMP2*IGFBP7 was different between the two groups at H0 (AKIN &lt; 3 versus AKIN = 3, respectively 0.96 (0.68-1.34) versus 5.96 (2.33-10.37) p = 0.0002) and at H12 (0.46 (0.28-0.93) and 3.65 (0.95-9.98); p = 0.0008). The median delta H0-H12 was not different between the groups. A TIMP2*IGFBP7 at H0 ¡Ü1.85 predict the absence of progression toward AKIN3 with a sensibility of 80 % and a specificity of 73 %. Compared to the creatininemia at baseline (AUC 0.61, 0.47-0.74), the AUC of TIMP2*IGFBP7 (0.80, 0.67-0.89; p = 0.05) urine test was superior for assessing the risk of AKIN3. But there was no difference with the diuresis at baseline (AUC 0.72, 0.58-0.83; p = 0.33).
