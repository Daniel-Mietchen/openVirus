 <bold>Methods:</bold> Every patient admitted for a septic shock in our medical ICU who presented an ARF AKIN 1 or 2 within the first 6 hours following the start of catecholamines was prospectively included. Exclusions criteria were pre-terminal chronic renal failure or chronic dialysis, anuria, patients AKIN 0 or AKIN 3. TIMP2*IGFBP7 urine assay was performed at baseline (H0) and H12. Clinical and biological parameters were collected at H0, H12 and H24. The performance of the Nephrocheck
 <sup>TM</sup> to predict the absence of evolution toward the AKIN 3 level within the first 24 hours was tested for the baseline measurement and for the evolution of the Nephrocheck
 <sup>TM</sup> between baseline and H12 (delta H0-H12).
