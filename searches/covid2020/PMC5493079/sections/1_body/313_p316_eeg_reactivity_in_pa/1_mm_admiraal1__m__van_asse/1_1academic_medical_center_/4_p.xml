<p id="Par2840">Prospective cohort study in patients monitored with continuous EEG after cardiac arrest in two Dutch ICUs. Twice a day a very strict stimulus protocol including five stimulus types (in this order: clapping, yelling patients name, passive eye opening, nasal tickle and sternal rub) was executed. Each stimulus was applied 3 times for 5Â s with an interval of 30s. Each stimulus response was individually scored reactive, non-reactive, doubtful or unscorable (e.g. too much noise) by three independent, blinded raters (JH, MvP, MT-C). Reactivity was defined as a change in the amplitude or frequency in the EEG upon stimulation, excluding muscle artifacts. Iso-electric EEGs were excluded beforehand. Stimulus responses on which two out of three raters agreed were included in the analysis.</p>
