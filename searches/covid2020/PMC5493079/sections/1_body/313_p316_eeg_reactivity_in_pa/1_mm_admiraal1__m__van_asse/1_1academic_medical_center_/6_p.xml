<p id="Par2842">The stimulation protocol was executed 72 times in 29 patients, resulting in 1050 independently rated stimulus responses. 42 stimuli were excluded because of disagreement between raters. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.38. The response to 91 stimuli in 19 patients was found reactive. The stimulus inducing EEG reactivity most often was clapping, 29 %. Passive eye opening least often induced EEG reactivity, 16 %.</p>
