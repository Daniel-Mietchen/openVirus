 <bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective analysis of patients survived over 24 hours after injury from J-OCTET (Japanese Observational study for Coagulation and Thrombolysis in Early Trauma) database. J-OCTET was a retrospective multicenter study to investigate disorders of coagulation and thrombolysis in patients with severe trauma. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to determine optimal cut-off values of hemoglobin, platelet count and fibrinogen at 24 hours after injury. We validated the models internally with bootstrapping to assess potential overfitting.
