 <bold>Results:</bold> There were 722 trauma patients included, with median age of 57 years, median injury severity score of 22, median revised trauma score of 7.84, and an overall mortality of 6.5 %. The optimal models associated with mortality were hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 g/dL (c-statistic 0.77, 95%CI　0.69-0.85), platelet count &lt; 10.0x10
 <sup>4</sup> /μ L (0.80, 0.72-0.87), fibrinogen &lt; 200 mg/dL (0.82, 0.72-0.92). After 200 cycles of bootstrapping, the average optimisms were 0.03, 0.03 and 0.01, respectively.
