 <bold>Results:</bold> From the 177 patients included, 20,3% developed ICU-AW. The mean age was 57,3 years and 58,3% were female. The median time of mechanical ventilation was 343,5 hours. 55,6% of patients had solid tumors and 44,4% had hematological malignancies. Glucocorticoids and neuromuscular blocking agents were administered in 88,9% and 38,9% of patients, respectively. Septic shock developed in 72,2% of patients and was found to be a predictive factor for developing ICU-AW (OR 4,15, pvalue 0,018). 66,7% of patients started or continued physical rehabilitation during the hospital length of stay approximately 12 days after admission in the ICU. 44,4% of patients with ICU-AW died 37 days after admission in the ICU. 8 patients (22,2%) with ICU-AW were re-evaluated by physical and rehabilitation medicine 144 days after hospital discharge. Significant improvement was noted in their physical status while in the program of physical therapy.
