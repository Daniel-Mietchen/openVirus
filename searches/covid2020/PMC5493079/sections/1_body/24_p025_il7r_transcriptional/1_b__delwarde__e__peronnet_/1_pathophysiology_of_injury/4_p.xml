 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This work put in highlight a marked decreased expression level of all IL7R splicing variants studied during septic shock. Persistence of lower expression on D3 was associated with higher mortality. The quantification of the expression of IL7R could provide an interesting biomarker to identify the most seriously ill patients who could benefit from new immunotherapies.
