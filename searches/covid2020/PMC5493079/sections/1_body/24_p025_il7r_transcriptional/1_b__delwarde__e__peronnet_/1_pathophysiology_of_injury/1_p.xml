 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Despite therapy improvement septic shock mortality is still around 30Â %. Better understanding of immunosuppression mechanisms led to new therapeutics perspectives such as recombinant IL-7 [1]. However it remains to better identify patients eligible for such immunotherapy. The soluble form of IL-7 receptor seems to be a promising candidate biomarker for this purpose since an association between its plasmatic concentration and mortality has been reported [2]. As we have no data on the transcriptional regulation of IL7R gene expression in septic shock, the aim of this study was to describe, in this pathology, the expression of several mRNA splicing variants of IL7R and to assess their association with mortality.
