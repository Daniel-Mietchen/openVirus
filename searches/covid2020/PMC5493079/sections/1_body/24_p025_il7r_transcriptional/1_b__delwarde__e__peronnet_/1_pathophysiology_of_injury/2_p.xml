 <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective study involved 30 ICU patients with septic shock. Whole blood sample was collected on the first (D1) and the third day (D3) after septic shock diagnosis. Expression levels of IL7R variants were measured using appropriate RT-qPCR designs: one specific of the variant encoding the membrane form of IL-7R, one specific of a variant corresponding to a potential soluble form and one covering all known splicing variants, including the 2 mentioned previously. Expression levels of these variants were described according to time and compared to 19 healthy volunteers. The association between our candidate biomarkers and day 28 status was assessed by logistic regression analyses. ROC curves were performed in order to evaluate performances.
