 <bold>Results:</bold> We noticed a decrease of expression levels of all IL7R splicing variants in patients compared to controls. An association between mortality and IL7R decreased expression was found for measurements at D3 and the ratio of expression D3/D1. This association was observed whatever the transcription variant used, in particular at D3 for the membrane form and for the potential soluble form of IL7R (OR = 0.28 [0.09–0.86], p = 0.026 and OR = 0.26 [0.07–0.93], p = 0.039, respectively). The ROC AUC for these models were 0.81 [0.65–0.97] and 0.84 [0.69–0.98].
