 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Deterioration of patients in hospitals is typically preceded by changes in vital signs. Deterioration detection based on changes of a single vital sign can result in missed deterioration events and high false alarm rates. Multi- parameter systems such as the modified and national early warning system (MEWS and NEWS) use look up tables to score data from multiple vital signs and specify actions based on the score. These systems offer improved performance compared to single-parameter systems, but were created through physician consensus and may not be making optimal use of the available data. Here we explore use of modern data mining techniques to derive a high performance multi- parameter deterioration detection algorithm, the Early Deterioration Indicator (EDI).
