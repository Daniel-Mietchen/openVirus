 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> EDI was developed using a data-driven approach to discover patterns in vital sign values that are predictive of imminent patient deterioration. It is based on continuous-value risk curves that are sensitive to subtle variations in vital signs, and may be automated for real- time risk assessment. EDI significantly improves performance over commonly deployed systems (MEWS and NEWS) while making use of the same input parameters, offering the possibility of a drop-in solution to reduce alarm fatigue.
