 <bold>Methods:</bold> EDI was created by producing risk curves for every input feature. Every feature value is mapped to a risk score which are added together to get the final score. Input features for EDI were: heart rate, systolic blood pressure, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, temperature and age. To derive and validate EDI, we collected data from 14282 general ward stays. 11864 stays were used to develop the algorithm. We tested the algorithm on the other 2418 stays. EDI, MEWS and NEWS were calculated in the middle of general ward stay for non- deteriorating stays. For patients who deteriorated, middle values in the last 6 hours before deterioration were used to calculate the scores. We computed sensitivity, specificity values and the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operator characteristic curve for the 3 scores and compared their performance.
