 <bold>Results:</bold> Results calculated based on 14-day outcome data suggest that likelihood of ICU admission is significantly increased by NEWS &gt; =5 (chi-squared = 5.029, p = 0.025), new AKI (chi-squared = 9.099, p = 0.003) and need for high flow oxygen at transfer (chi-squared = 16.634, p &lt; 0.0001). Patient mortality was significantly increased by NEWS &gt; =5 (chi-squared = 6.391, p = 0.011), respiratory rate &gt; =24 (chi-squared = 5.417, p = 0.020), need for high flow oxygen at transfer (chi-squared = 19.394, p &lt; 0.00001), detection of metabolic acidosis on blood gas analysis (chi-squared = 4.764, p = 0.030) and new AKI (chi-squared = 5.056, p = 0.025). Additionally, new AKI significantly increases length of stay (+5.785 days, p = 0.003). Patients will be followed up for a period of 3 months and current preliminary results will be reassessed with 3-month outcome data in this ongoing study.
