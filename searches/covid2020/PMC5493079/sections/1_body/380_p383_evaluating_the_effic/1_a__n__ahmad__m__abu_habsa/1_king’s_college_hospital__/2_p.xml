 <bold>Methods:</bold> 113 patients were randomly selected from King’s College Hospital emergency admissions. Notes were screened for the presence of: a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) &gt; =5 or respiratory rate &gt; =24 at transfer from the ED to the ward, sepsis with hypotension at any point, new acute kidney injury (AKI), lactate &gt; =4 or metabolic acidosis on blood gas analysis and need for high flow oxygen at transfer from the ED to the ward. Primary outcome measures were mortality, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, and length of stay. Associations between proposed criteria and patient outcomes were statistically evaluated.
