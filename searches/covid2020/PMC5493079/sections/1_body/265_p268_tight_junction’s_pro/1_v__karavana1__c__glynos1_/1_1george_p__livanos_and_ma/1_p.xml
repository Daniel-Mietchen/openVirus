 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Acute Lung Injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is characterized by tight junction’s (TJ’s) barrier disruption and changes in the composition and integrity of Claudins (CLDN) which are components of TJ’s. CLDN5 is highly expressed and augment permeability in lung parenchyma, although the regulation by inflammatory stimuli remains elusive. This study aims to investigate CLDN5 expression and regulation by TNF, in LPS-induced ALI/ARDS in mice.
