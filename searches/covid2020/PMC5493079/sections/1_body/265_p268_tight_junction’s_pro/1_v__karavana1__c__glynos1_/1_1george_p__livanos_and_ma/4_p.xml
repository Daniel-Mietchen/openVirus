 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In LPS induced ALI/ARDS in mice, CLDN5 was increased associated with ALI severity. Moreover, TNF regulates CLDN5 expression, and TJs permeability dependent in part on ERK1/2 pathway. Our findings emerge the role of Claudins and especially CLDN5 to elucidate the pathophysiology of this form of injury.
