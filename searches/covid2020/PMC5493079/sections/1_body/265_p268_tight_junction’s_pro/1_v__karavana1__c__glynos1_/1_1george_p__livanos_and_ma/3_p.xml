 <bold>Results:</bold> In mice lung tissue, following LPS administration, CLDN5 immunoreactivity was distributed along the alveolar epithelium and vascular endothelium. CLDN5 protein expression levels was increased by 3 fold along with ALI characteristics (augmented in BALF cellularity, protein content and ALI score). In TNF-/- mice, CLDN5 expression is statistically reduced as early as 6 h after LPS administration with consequently increased in BALF protein content. In addition increased CLDN5 expression was observed upon 24 h LPS administration. TNF biphasic action on CLDN5 expression was dependent on ERK1/2 expression levels.
