 <bold>Methods:</bold> Lung injury was induced by intratracheal LPS administration in adult male C57BL/6, and TNF-/- mice. Mice underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sacrificed at 6 h and 24 h after LPS administration. Histological score of ALI was assessed in lung tissues. CLDN5 cellular localization was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, while its expression levels were verified by Western blotting.
