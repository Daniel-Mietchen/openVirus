 <bold>Results:</bold> The team sent 391 questionnaires and obtained 240 answers (61%). Responders had 46 ± 10 years, 52% are male and worked in intensive care for 10(4-19) years, 86% worked in full time, of those working in shared schedule (n = 33) only 16 dedicated &lt; 50 % of their time to ICM. Primary specialty of the responders was: Internal Medicine (67%), Anaesthesiology (24%) and other (9%). Most of them (73%) had previous experience in their primary specialty before initiating Intensive Care practice, during 2(1-5) years. When questioned about the ideal model 45% (n = 106) choose a “primary speciality” and of those: 69% thinks that training should be 5 years; 90% consider important a common core with Internal Medicine (92%), Anaesthesiology (92%), Emergency Medicine (89%), Cardiology (83%) and others (7,4%); for 81% the remaining training should be entirely in ICM and of these 95 % think that training in a dedicated ICU should be considered, mainly in neuro-ICU (93%) and RED-ICU (61%). For those who support ICM as a supra-specialty (51%,n = 121) or sub-specialty (28%,n = 65) the main reasons pointed were: previous specialty facilitates acquisition of ICM knowledge (97%), increases clinical autonomy (97%), provides a higher capacity in clinical judgment and medical decisions (90%) and allows more firm bioethics knowledge (80%); it is an advantage having a multidisciplinary team (95%). Regarding the training program: 77% knows the CoBatriCE project; 89% knows the PACT and 95% finds it usefull. Technical competencies found to be desirable in the ICM training were: Echocardiogram (97%), Bronchoscopy (97%), Fast Eco (97%) and others (30%). Undergraduate teaching was reported as desirable by 83% (n = 193).
