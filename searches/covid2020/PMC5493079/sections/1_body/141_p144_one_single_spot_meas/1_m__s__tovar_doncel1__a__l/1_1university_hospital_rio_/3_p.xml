 <bold>Results:</bold> Acute pulmonary hypertension was characterized by an increase in the mPAP, followed by high RAP and low MAP. The time course of the sublingual mci alterations was recorded simultaneously with the hemodynamic changes (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig29" ref-type="fig">29</xref>). The progressive raise in RAP induced blood to flow backward to the large veins, inducing venous stasis and reducing microcirculatory perfusion. Despite the adrenergic response with normalization of MAP, no recovery in sublingual mci was observed.
