 <bold>Introductions:</bold> The effect of pulmonary hypertension in the sublingual microcirculation (mci) remains unclear. We described in a pig model of shock the effects of the hemodynamic changes during acute pulmonary hypertension in conjunction with sublingual mci alterations measured with the Cytocam-IDF (Indident dark-field illumination) imaging fixed in one sublingual spot.
