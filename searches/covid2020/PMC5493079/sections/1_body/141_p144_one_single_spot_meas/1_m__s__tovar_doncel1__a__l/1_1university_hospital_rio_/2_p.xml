 <bold>Methods:</bold> Pulmonary hypertension was unexpectedly observed as a complication after intravenous infusion of contrast agent through the central venous catheter. This contrast agent can induce allergic reactions leading to massive blockage of the pulmonary arteries and increase pressure in the pulmonary capillaries. A similar response was observed in three other animals. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), right atrial pressure (RAP), and pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) were recorded continuously. One single spot measurement of the sublingual mci was performed with the Cytocam-IDF imaging fixed on a metal arm support.
