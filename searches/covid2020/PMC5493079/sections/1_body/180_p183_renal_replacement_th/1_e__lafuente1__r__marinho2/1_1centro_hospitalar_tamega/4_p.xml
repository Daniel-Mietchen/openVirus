 <bold>Results:</bold> 127 patients were enrolled, with an average age of 61,3 ± 15,26, and mortality rate was 46 %. 42 patients performed SLED (33,07 %), and 85 % performed CRRT (63,97 %). The most common indications for CRRT was fluid overload (47,76 %). Most of the patients start the both procedures in the first two days in ICU. Most of the patients (59 Ð 60 %) were in organ failure, using the RIFLE criteria when they started RRT. Patients in CRRT were more hemodynamically unstable (norepinephrine in CRRT Ð 1,99 ± 5,36 and in SLED - 1,49 ± 4,56). Mortality rate Ð 52,94 % in CRRT and 30,95 in SLED.
