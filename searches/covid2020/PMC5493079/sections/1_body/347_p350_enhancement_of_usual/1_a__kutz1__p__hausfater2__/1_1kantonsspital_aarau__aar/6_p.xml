<p id="Par3178">Using data from 7132 consecutive ED patients (median age 62 years, 53.3 % male), the risk for 30 day mortality showed a stepwise increase from low (0.64 % [95 % CI 0.37-0.92]) in patients with a ProADM value of &lt;0.75 nmol/L, to intermediate (4.38 % [95 % CI 3.58-5.18]) with a ProADM value &gt;0.75 nmol/L and &lt;1.5 nmol/L, to high (15.5 % [95 % CI 13.5-17.5]) with a ProADM value of &gt;1.5 nmol/L (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.0001). Combining initial ED triage (MTS) and ProADM reveals an observed risk for 30 day mortality of 0.5 % (14/2780 patients) in case of low priority initial triage and a ProADM value of &lt;0.75 nmol/L until 23.1 % (96/416) in case of high priority initial triage and a ProADM value of &gt;1.5 nmol/L. In low priority patients the overall 30 day mortality was 2.95 % (164/5550). Adding ProADM values of &lt;0.75 nmol/L the relative risk reduction was -83 %, whereas adding ProADM values of &gt;1.5 nmol/L increased the risk for mortality four times. In high priority patients (11.56 % overall 30 day mortality) relative risk reduction was -86 % adding ProADM values of &lt;0.75 nmol/L, and doubled in patients with ProADM values of &gt;1.5 nmol/L.</p>
