 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Sepsis is a systemic, potentially fatal host response to infection, in which the speed and appropriateness of the therapy administered in the initial hours are likely to influence outcome. Patients with sepsis are not always easily recognized prehospitally and septic patients thus may be transported to hospital either on their own accord, by ambulance or by physician assisted Mobile Emergency Care Unit (MECU). We wanted to address to which degree the type of transport from the prehospital scene and into the hospital is related to severity of sepsis and 30Â day mortality.
