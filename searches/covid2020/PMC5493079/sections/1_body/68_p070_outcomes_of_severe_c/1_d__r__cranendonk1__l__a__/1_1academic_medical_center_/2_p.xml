 <bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective observational cohort study included all consecutive patients admitted to two tertiary ICU’s between January 2011 and January 2014. From this cohort, patients with possible, probable or definite sepsis diagnosed within 24 h were selected. ICU readmissions during the same hospital admissions and readmissions within 30 days of the first hospital admission were excluded. Using set criteria, sepsis admissions attributed to cellulitis or soft tissue infections were retrospectively recategorized by an independent researcher as admissions for NF, severe (i.e. ICU necessitating) cellulitis, or another primary diagnosis but where cellulitis was present as a comorbidity.
