 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The skin is a common site of infection in intensive care units (ICUâ€™s). However, in contrast to necrotizing fasciitis (NF), limited clinical data is available for severe cellulitis in the critically ill. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical presentation of patients admitted to the ICU for severe cellulitis, as compared to patients with NF.
