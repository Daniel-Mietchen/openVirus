 <bold>Results:</bold> Among 2562 ICU sepsis admissions, 31 (1.2 %) patients were admitted for NF and 23 (0.9 %) for severe cellulitis. Cellulitis was diagnosed as a comorbidity in another 25 patients. Comparing severe cellulitis to NF, there were no differences in age, BMI, concurrent infections or length of hospital stay prior to ICU admission. Patients with severe cellulitis had lower rates of shock (30 % vs 61 %, p = 0.03) and need for mechanical ventilation within 24 h after admission (52 % vs 94 %, p = 0.003), but had more chronic comorbidities (87 % vs 55 %, p = 0.02), especially of cardiovascular origin (44 % vs 13 %, p = 0.01). With causative agents identified in 78 % of severe cellulitis patients, S. aureus was the dominant organism (present in 44 %), while 44 % had a Gram-negative infection and 26 % a polymicrobial infection. S. pyogenes was the primary organism in NF (61.3 %). Length of ICU stay was shorter for severe cellulitis patients (3 [2-5] vs 5 [3-11] days, p = 0.01). Hospital- and 90 day mortality were similar in the two groups (26.1 % vs 22.6 %, p &gt; .99; 30.4 % vs 22.6 %, p = 0.54 respectively).
