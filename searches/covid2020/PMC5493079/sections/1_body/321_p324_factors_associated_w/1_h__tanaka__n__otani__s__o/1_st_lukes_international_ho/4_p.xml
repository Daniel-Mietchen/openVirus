<p id="Par2935">We performed a retrospective cohort study of OHCA patients brought to the emergency room at St. Luke fs International Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, who underwent TTM between January 2006 and July 2015. Primary outcome was days to weaning from admission to the intensive care unit. Using the electronic medical record, we collected patient characteristics, resuscitation conditions, and examination data at admission. After characterizing weaning success using descriptive statistics, the relationship between ventilator weaning during hospitalization and resuscitation conditions were assessed with Cox regression.</p>
