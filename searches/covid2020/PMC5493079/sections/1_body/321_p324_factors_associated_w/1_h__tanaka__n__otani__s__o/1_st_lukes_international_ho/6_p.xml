<p id="Par2937">Of 115 OHCA patients who completed TTM, median time to weaning from ventilation was 6 days (4-8: IQR). 98 patients (85 %) were weaned within 2 weeks after admission. Earlier weaning was significantly associated with age (HR, 0.96; 95 % CI, 0.94 to 0.97) and motor response on admission (HR, 1.56; 95 % CI, 1.01 to 2.41). Though not significantly associated with weaning, ventricular fibrillation and asystole showed a trend towards early and later weaning, respectively, compared to Pulseless Electrical Activity.</p>
