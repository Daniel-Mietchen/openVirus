<p id="Par2939">A large majority of TTM patients can be weaned from ventilation within 2Â weeks. Older age and absence of motor response at admission are related with prolonged mechanical ventilation. Early tracheostomy planning should be considered for patients after achievement of TTM who are older and does not show motor response in ER.</p>
