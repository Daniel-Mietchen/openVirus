<p id="Par2933">Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) may have substantial difficulty in ventilator weaning due to multiple organ failure, including post-TTM neurologic injury. Ability to predict the clinical course of TTM patients regarding duration of ventilation is important for clinical decision-making for both safer extubation and planning early tracheostomy. However, predictive factors of ventilator weaning after TTM remain unclear. Hypothesizing that weaning difficulty is associated with admission resuscitation conditions, we explore whether failure to wean may also be predicted at admission. The purpose of this study is to examine which factors predict ventilator weaning difficulty.</p>
