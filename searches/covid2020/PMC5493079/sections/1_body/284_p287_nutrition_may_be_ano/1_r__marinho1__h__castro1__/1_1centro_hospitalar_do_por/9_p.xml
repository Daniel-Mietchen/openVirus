<p id="Par2576">Energy needs in a critically ill patient can vary between 20-25 Kcal/kg/day. In our study a large proportion of Portuguese ICUs patients receive inadequate nutrition. Recent randomized clinical trials support the recommendation that “less nutrition is better”. However, it is not uncommon for critically ill patients to be starved and this is deleterious and should be avoided.</p>
