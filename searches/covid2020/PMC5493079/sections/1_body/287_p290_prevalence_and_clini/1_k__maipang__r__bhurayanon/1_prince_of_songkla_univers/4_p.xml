<p id="Par2601">Prospective observational study was conducted during 6 months in the medical ICU in Songklanakarind hospital. Demographic data and clinical outcomes, including 28-days mortality, ventilator days, ICU and hospital length of stay, were collected. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D was measured within 24 hours after ICU admission. The 25(OH)D level less than 20 ng/ml is generally defined as a deficiency state. The correlation of 25(OH)D status on admission and clinical outcomes were then analyzed with chi-square test or student T-test. The p-value less than 0.05 defined as clinically significant.</p>
