 <bold>Introductions:</bold> The Ci-Ca CVVHD is a successfully implemented protocol in several European countries to conduct CRRT in patients with AKI [1]. This protocol recommends a calcium chloride solution (CaCl-S) for calcium supplementation. Due to non-availability of CaCl-S, we modified this approach and used a calcium gluconate solution (CaGl-S) instead.
