 <bold>Methods:</bold> The Ci-Ca CVVHD protocol [1] relies on modifying the calcium substitution to control s-iCa, which we applied analogously in our modified protocol. Further in the Ci-Ca CVVHD protocol, the ratio between dialysate flow (Qd) and blood flow (Qb) is linked to the effect on the acid-base status and typically set to 33 %, which we essentially applied throughout the study using 3 l/h dialysate flow at 150 ml/min blood flow. Systemic ionized Ca (s-iCa)and acid-base parameters were closely monitored to ensure safe application of our modified protocol. We retrospectively analyzed 14 critically ill patients.
