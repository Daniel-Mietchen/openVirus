 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We successfully established use of a CaGl-S with the Ci-Ca CVVHD protocol. Noting the slight trend to alkalosis, we have decided to slightly reduce the blood flow to 130Â ml/min. This will reduce citrate needs and less citrate will be metabolized by the patient to bicarbonate.
