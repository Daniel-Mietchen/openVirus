 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Limited research exists examining the incidence and nature of patient-reported alopecia in adult survivors of critical illness. The type, amount and location of the hair loss varied between patients in this study. The main limitation of this study is the survey design resulting in a lack of information regarding potential predictors of alopecia. The incidence reported in this study however suggests that further research is warranted.
