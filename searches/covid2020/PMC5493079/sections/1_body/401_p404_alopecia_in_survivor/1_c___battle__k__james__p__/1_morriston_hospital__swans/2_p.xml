 <bold>Methods:</bold> This was a single centre, qualitative survey study completed in the ICU Follow-up Clinic of a teaching hospital in Wales. All patients who had been discharged home for at least 12 weeks, following an ICU stay of three or more days and attending the Follow-Up Clinic, were invited to complete the survey. The survey was adapted from one used in a previous study and included questions regarding patient demographics and alopecia.(2) Statistical analysis included numbers (%) and medians (IQR). Comparisons between patients with and without alopecia were made using Fisher’s Exact test and Mann Whitney U test. Due to the anonymity of the surveys the Wales REC 6 confirmed ethical approval was not needed for this study.
