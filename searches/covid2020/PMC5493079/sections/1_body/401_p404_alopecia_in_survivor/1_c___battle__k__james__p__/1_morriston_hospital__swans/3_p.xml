 <bold>Results:</bold> The survey was completed by 75 patients attending the clinic between July and December 2014. Median age was 65 years and 35 % of patients were male. Alopecia was reported in 13 (17 %) patients and the hair loss was gradual in 12 (92 %) of the 13 patients. The severity of hair loss in this cohort ranged between less than 10 % to over 50 %, with the location of hair loss varying between the patients. In all but one of the patients hair loss occurred gradually at between one and six weeks post-ICU discharge and lasted for between one and seven months. On analysis, no significant differences were found between the patients with and without alopecia in the demographic variables.
