 <bold>Methods:</bold> Intensive Care Units (ICUs) were invited to participate voluntarily in the Intensive Care Over Nations (ICON) audit. In participating centers, data was prospectively collected from all adult patients (&gt;16 years) admitted to the ICU during a 10-day period. Patients admitted for less than 24 h for routine postoperative surveillance were excluded. Data was collected daily during the ICU stay up to 28 days, with a follow-up for outcome data until hospital discharge or death. AKI was defined according to the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss and End-Stage (RIFLE) classification and was diagnosed during the first 48 h after ICU admission. Patients with pre-existent chronic renal failure (CRF) were analyzed as a separate subgroup.
