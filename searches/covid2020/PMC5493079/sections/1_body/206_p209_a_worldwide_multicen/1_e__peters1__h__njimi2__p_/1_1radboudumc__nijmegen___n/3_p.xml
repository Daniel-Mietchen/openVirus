 <bold>Results:</bold> The study population comprised 9579 patients. At admission, 30 % of patients fulfilled sepsis criteria of which 67 % developed AKI, compared to 57 % in the non-septic population (p &lt; 0.0001). AKI was more severe in septic patients and these patients were less likely to recover to a lower RILFE category compared to non-septic patients (improvement between day 3 and day 7 in 22 vs. 32 %, p &lt; 0.0001). Dialysis incidence was higher in septic patients compared to non-septic patients (21 % vs. 5 %, p &lt; 0.0001). Also in-hospital mortality rates were higher (33 % vs. 14 %, p &lt; 0.0001), which increased to 51 % in septic and 35 % in non-septic AKI-F patients. Hospital mortality of septic AKI-F patients was similar compared to septic patients with pre-existent CRF (HR 1.6, 95%CI 1.3-2.0 compared to 1.8, 95%CI 1.5-2.1 in septic AKI-F patients). Septic patients with AKI-R or AKI-I that improved between day 3 and day 7 after admission showed a similar mortality compared to septic patients who did not develop AKI, while mortality remained elevated in AKI-F patients that improved between day 3 and 7.
