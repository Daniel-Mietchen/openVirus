<p id="Par2962">It is well known that neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus are resistant to short period of ischemia. Hyperthermia is a proven risk factor for cerebral ischemia and can produce more extensive brain damage and related with mortality rates. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of hyperthermic conditioning (H) on neuronal death, gliosis and expressions of SODs as anti-oxidative enzymes in the gerbil DG following 5Â min-transient cerebral ischemia.</p>
