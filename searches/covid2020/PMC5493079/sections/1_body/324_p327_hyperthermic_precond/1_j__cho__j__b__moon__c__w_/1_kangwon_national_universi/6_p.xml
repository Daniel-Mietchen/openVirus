<p id="Par2966">In the (N + ischemia)-groups, a significant neuronal death was observed in the polymorphic layer (PL) from 1 day after ischemia-reperfusion. In the (H + ischemia)-groups, neuronal death was also observed in the PL from 1 day post-ischemia; the degree of the neuronal death was severer than that in the (N + ischemia)-groups. In addition, we examined the gliosis of astrocytes and microglia using anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and anti- ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1). GFAP+ and Iba-1+ glial cells were much more activated in the (H + ischemia)-groups than those in the (N + ischemia)-groups. On the other hand, immunoreactivities and levels of SOD1 rather than SOD2 were significantly lower in the (H + ischemia)-groups than those in the (N + ischemia)-groups.</p>
