 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> DIC, although associated with outcome, remains underdiagnosed in critically ill patients. In patients with moderate or severe thrombocytopenia a truncated DIC score should be calculated. If the score is between 2 and 4, measurement of D-Dimers or FDP should be requested to fully establish the diagnosis of DIC.
