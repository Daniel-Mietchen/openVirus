 <bold>Results:</bold> 464 patients were included in the analysis. ICU mortality was 25.4 %. Mean APACHE II was 19.8 ± 7.1. 272 patients had a maximum DIC score of 0 (167 patients) or 1 (105 patients) and were not at risk for overt DIC. However, 192 patients had a maximum DIC score of ≥2, with 14 patients displaying a DIC score of 5 even without D-Dimer results available. In none of the patients with a DIC score of ≥2, D-Dimer or FDPs were analysed. Only one patient with a DIC score of ≥2 had normal platelet counts and two patients showed mild thrombocytopenia. All patients with severe thrombocytopenia and 73 of 122 patients with moderate thrombocytopenia had a DIC score of ≥2.
