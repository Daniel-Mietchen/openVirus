 <bold>Introductions:</bold> The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC scoring system has been developed as a simple tool to diagnose DIC. It is based on platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen level and fibrin degradation products (FDP) or D-Dimer results. However, the score is less useful in critical illness as D-Dimers and FDP are usually elevated due to the underlying disease. Hence neither DIC scoring nor FDP or D-Dimer measurements are routinely performed in ICU. Triggers to request D-Dimer measurements have not been established.
