 <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective study included ICU patients admitted to the RLUH over a 4-year period. Demographic details were collected at admission along with routine blood results for the first 7 days. A truncated DIC score was calculated for all patients who had coagulation tests done for 7 days: Platelet count &gt;100x10
 <sup>9</sup>/L = 0 points, &gt;50 to &lt;100x10
 <sup>9</sup>/L = 1 point, &lt; 50x10
 <sup>9</sup>/L = 2 points, PT &lt;3 s prolonged = 0 points, &gt;3 s but &lt;6 s = 1 point, &gt;6 s = 2 points, fibrinogen &gt;1.5 g/L = 0 points, &lt;1.5 g/L = 1 point. Patients with a truncated DIC score of ≥2 were considered high risk for DIC. In this patient cohort, highly elevated D-Dimers would establish a diagnosis of overt DIC. Patients admitted after elective surgery and those who stayed on ICU &lt;7 days were excluded.
