 <bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a cross-sectional study of adult patients admitted to the ID-ICU with the diagnosis of MSF between 1992 and 2014. The patients were identified in our department database and subsequently the clinical records were consulted. The primary outcome was death and secondary outcomes were its predictors. We used the most appropriate measure of central tendency and distribution and statistical test (significance level 0.05).
