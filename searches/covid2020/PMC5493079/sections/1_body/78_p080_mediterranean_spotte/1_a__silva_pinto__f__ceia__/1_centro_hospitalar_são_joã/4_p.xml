<p id="Par1388">The mortality rate was 13 % (n = 4). We found a statistical significant association between the SAPS II score and mortality: higher scores are linked to death (Mann Whitney U test). We also found association between higher leukocyte count and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) at admission with death (Mann Whitney U test). We did not find association between any other analytical abnormality at admission and at death. We also did not find any bad outcome association with patients’ symptoms, physical examination abnormalities, renal or ventilation support (Person’s Qui Squared Test).</p>
