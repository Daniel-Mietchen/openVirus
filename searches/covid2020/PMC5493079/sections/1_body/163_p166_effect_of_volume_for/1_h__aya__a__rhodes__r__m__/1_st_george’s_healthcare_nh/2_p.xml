 <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients were randomly allocated to receive 2, 3, 4 or 5 ml /kg (body weight) of intravenous crystalloid over five minutes. Pmsf was measured using the arterial pressure after stopping blood flow in the arm with a pneumatic tourniquet inflated for one minute. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) were recorded at baseline and immediately after the fluid infusion. CO was measured with LiDCOplus monitor. A positive response was defined as an increase of 10 % from baseline. From previous data, the least significant change (LSC) for Pmsf was 14 %. Medians were compared using the independent samples media test, and proportions were compared using an exact fisher test. Statistical significance was considered when p &lt; 0.05
