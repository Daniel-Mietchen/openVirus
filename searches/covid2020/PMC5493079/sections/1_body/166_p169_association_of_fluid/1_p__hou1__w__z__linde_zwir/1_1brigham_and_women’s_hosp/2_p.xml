 <bold>Methods:</bold> CAP was defined as a bacterial pneumonia diagnosis present on admission in ED patients receiving chest x-ray and parenteral antibiotics on Day 1. Day 1 total fluid volume was stratified into quartiles. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and secondary outcome was VFDs over a 30Â day period. To adjust for potential confounds, patients were stratified into 5 severity groups based on their modelled predicted mortality, and a propensity model for giving fluids was built using clinical characteristics, severity of illness scores, and ICD-9-CM codes present on admission for important acute and chronic conditions. Patients were then grouped by severity of illness quintiles of predicted risk of death for the CAP population. The association of fluid administration with outcome was assessed within each quintile of mortality risk using chi-square analysis.
