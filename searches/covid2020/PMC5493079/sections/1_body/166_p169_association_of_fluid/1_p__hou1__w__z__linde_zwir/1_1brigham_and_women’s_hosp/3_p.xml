 <bold>Results:</bold> 192,806 adult ED patients with CAP were analyzed. Patients were 51.3 % female with a mean age of 69. Overall mortality rate was 7.4 % with an average of 24.6 VFDs. After propensity adjustment by severity of illness, mean amount of fluid administered on day 1 ranged from 842 ml to 2,189 ml. Within the fifth severity quintile we found a significant difference in the hospital (22.5 %) vs. predicted (18.3 %) mortality rate in the highest fluid quartile. Similarly, within the fifth severity quintile, we found a significant difference in the number of VFDs in the highest fluid quartile (16.1) compared to the rest of the quartiles (19.3-20.3).
