 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> For adult ED patients with CAP, we found significant associations between day 1 fluids and increased mortality and decreased VFDs in the highest fluid quartile and severity group, after adjusting for severity of illness and acuity level. This study may have identified the subset of ED patients who may benefit from a more restrictive fluid strategy when presenting to the hospital with CAP.
