 <bold>Results:</bold> Two hundred ninety-five patients were admitted to our ICU over the study period; 33 of whom were recruited into the present study. We identified 13 patients (39.4 %) with ARC. Patients with ARC were younger (46.5 vs. 70.7 years; p &lt; 0.05), were less frequently male (23.1 % vs. 70 %; p &lt; 0.05), had a lower APACHE II score (12.6 vs. 17.6; p &lt; 0.05), and were less frequently diagnosed with sepsis (0 % vs. 40 %; p &lt; 0.05) than patients without ARC.
