 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The phenomenon of augmented renal clearance (ARC) is increasingly reported in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, there have been few reports on ARC in Japan. The aim of this observational study was to describe the prevalence and the patient characteristics of ARC in a cohort of patients with normal serum creatinine level at a Japanese ICU.
