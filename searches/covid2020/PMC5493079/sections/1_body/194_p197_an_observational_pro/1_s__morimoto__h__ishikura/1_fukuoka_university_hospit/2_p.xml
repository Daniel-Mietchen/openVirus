 <bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a prospective cohort study from May to September, 2015 at the emergency ICU of a tertiary university hospital in Japan. The creatinine clearance (CLCR) rate of all patients was measured on admission. ARC was defined as a body surface adjusted CLCR rate of †130 mL/min/1.73 m2. We sought to study the incidence of ARC and to record the patient characteristics that were associated with ARC prospectively.
