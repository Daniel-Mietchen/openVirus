 <bold>Results:</bold> Phagoburn was funded by European Commission (FP7) in 2013 for 3,8 million Euros. After transfer from research and development to a Master Phage Bank, bioproduction of phages was performed in GMP-like conditions by Clean Cells (Nantes-France). As a systemic absorption of phages is supposed, an isolator was necessary to ensure a sterile and apyrogenic solution.
