<p id="Par3279">Our results show that only a small minority of patients (18/312 = 5.8 %) admitted with intoxication or overdose that are not ventilated on ICU admission develop the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation in the next 24 hours. A quarter of patients admitted with a GCS &lt; 8 was subsequently intubated and ventilated in the first 24 hrs, whereas only 2.6 % of patients admitted with a GCS &gt; =8 needed tracheal intubation and ventilation in the first 24 hrs after ICU admission. Our study shows that the GCS on admission is a significant predictor for the need of mechanical ventilation. </p>
