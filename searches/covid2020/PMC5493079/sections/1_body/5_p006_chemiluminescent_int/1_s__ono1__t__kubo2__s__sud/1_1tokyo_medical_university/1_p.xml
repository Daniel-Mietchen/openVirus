 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Recent studies have demonstrated that the endotoxin activity levels, which were analyzed using the Endotoxin Activity Assay (EAA), correlated with the severity of sepsis in patients admitted to the ICU. On the other hand, there are several reports that they dispute the clinical utility of the EAA. We focused on chemiluminescent intensity (CI) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by EAA and evaluated the predictive value for the incidence of postoperative infectious complications following elective gastroenterological surgery.
