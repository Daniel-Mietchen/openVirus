 <bold>Results:</bold> Postoperative infectious complications occurred in 23 of the 48 patients. There were significant differences in the EA levels between patients who developed postoperative infectious complications and patients who did not on POD3. Minimum CI was significantly higher in the patients who developed postoperative infectious complications at all points compared to those from the patients who did not. In addition, the ratio of maximal CI to minimum CI, which reflects the neutrophil function against maximal LPS, was significantly lower before surgery and on POD1 in patients who developed postoperative infectious complications. Although a significant positive correlation was observed between the neutrophil counts and maximal CI or minimum CI, no correlation was observed between the neutrophil counts and the ratio of maximal CI to minimum CI.
