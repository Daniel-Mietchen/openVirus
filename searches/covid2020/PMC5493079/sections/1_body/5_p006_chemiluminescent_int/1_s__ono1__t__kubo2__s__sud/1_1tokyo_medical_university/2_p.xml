 <bold>Methods:</bold> Forty eight patients who underwent elective surgery for gastrointestinal cancer were enrolled in this study. Blood samples were taken on the previous day (before surgery), and on the first (POD1) and third postoperative days (POD3). All blood samples were analyzed using the EAA system. We focused on CI max, which is maximally stimulated with LPS and the minimum CI, which is only stimulated with opsonized zymosan.
