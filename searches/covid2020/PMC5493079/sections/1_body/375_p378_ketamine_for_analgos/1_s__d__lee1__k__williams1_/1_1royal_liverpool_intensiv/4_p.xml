<p id="Par3476">Over a 6-year period we retrospectively identified patients who received ketamine for hypoxic respiratory failure after admission to critical care. Ketamine dose, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, blood biochemistry, ventilator settings, and sedation score were recorded over the first 5Â days of ketamine treatment. Complications (delirium, arrhythmias, malabsorption of feed) were documented. Chest X-ray findings were documented on the day ketamine was commenced.</p>
