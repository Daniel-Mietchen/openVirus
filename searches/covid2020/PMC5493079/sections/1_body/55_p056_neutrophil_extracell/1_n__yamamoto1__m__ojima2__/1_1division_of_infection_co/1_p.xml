 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are one of the immune systems to suppress dissemination of infection by the netted chromatin decorated with antibacterial molecules. We reported that NETs were not observed in the abscess, but a lot of NETs appeared after abscess drainage. Since closed wound area is known to be hypoxic, we hypothesized that NETs production was affected by the concentration of oxygen.
