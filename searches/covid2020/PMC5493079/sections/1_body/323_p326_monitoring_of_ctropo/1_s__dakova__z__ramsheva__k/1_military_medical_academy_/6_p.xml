<p id="Par2955">Patients were divided into two groups-discharged alive and died in hospital. The average age of patients was 75,27 ± 12,6 (SD) years. Men’s age was 72,64 ± 13.50(SD)years, and women’s 75,27 ± 12,67 (SD) years. In hospital mortality among patients were 43.6 % (95/218). The patients discharged alive were 56.4 %(123/218).The cTnI was investigated on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day. According to the laboratory test results established upper limit of cTnI is 0.06 mg/l. We found higher levels on admission in 47.2 % (103/218), on the 3rd day in 54,6 % (119/218) and on the 5th day in (93/218). Among all patients with high cTnI in hospital mortality was 70.9 %(73/103)on admission, on the 3rd day 76.5 % (91/119), and 82.8 % (77/93). We used nonparametric method for comparing the medians of two variables. Statistically significant differences in the levels of cTnI were found in group died in hospital. About the first and fifth days the cut off points established by ROC analysis were 0,075 mg/l, while about the third was 0,085 mg/l (Area = 0.771,CI = 0.704-0.837). The sensitivity of the method was 74.16 % and specificity 76.42 % for the first measurement, 86.52 % and 78.05 % for the third and for the fifth day 77.53 % and 88.62 %.</p>
