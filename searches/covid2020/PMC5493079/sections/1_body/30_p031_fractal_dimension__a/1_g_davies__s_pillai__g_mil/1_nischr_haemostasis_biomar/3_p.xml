 <bold>Results:</bold> 95 patients were included in the study: 49 with sepsis, 19 with severe sepsis and 27 with septic shock. 44 healthy volunteers were recruited as a matched control. Mean Df in the healthy control group was 1.74 ± 0.03. Mean Df in patients with sepsis and severe sepsis was significantly higher (1.78 ± 0.07 and 1.80 ± 0.05 respectively (p &lt; 0.05, One-way ANOVA Post-hoc Bonferroni correction)). Mean Df in patients with septic shock was significantly lower compared to all other groups (1.66 ± 0.10 (p &lt; 0.001, One-way ANOVA Post-hoc Bonferroni correction)). Df was also significantly lower in non-survivors than survivors at 28 days (1.66 ± 0.13 vs 1.76 ± 0.08, p = 0.006 (Students t-test)).
