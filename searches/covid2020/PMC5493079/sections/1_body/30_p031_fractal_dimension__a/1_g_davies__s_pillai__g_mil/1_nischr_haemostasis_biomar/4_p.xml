 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate that patients with sepsis and severe sepsis form tight highly branched fibrin clots (as indicated by high Df). As the disease progresses to septic shock, much weaker clots are formed (as indicated by low Df). This may help to explain the dichotomy of thrombogenicity and bleeding diathesis in patients across the sepsis spectrum. The new functional biomarker, fractal dimension (Df), therefore can be used to quantify clot microstructure across the sepsis spectrum. It can also be used as an outcome measure, although this study was not powered for outcome.
