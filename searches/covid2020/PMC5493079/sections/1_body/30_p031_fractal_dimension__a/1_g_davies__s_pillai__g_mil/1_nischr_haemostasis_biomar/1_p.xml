 <bold>Introduction:</bold> It is well recognised that coagulation is altered across the sepsis spectrum (sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock). This can range from an increased thrombotic risk to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have attempted to investigate these changes in coagulation using standard and global markers of coagulation [1]; however, clot microstructure has not been investigated. Recent research has led to the development of a new biomarker of clot microstructure, Df, which quantifies the fibrin network of the incipient clot [2]. This study aims to investigate the role of clot microstructure in sepsis, by using new quantitative biomarker of clot microstructure, Df.
