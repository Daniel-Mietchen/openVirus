 <bold>Methods:</bold> This is an animal case-report in which the CVP waveform was recorded during an ongoing experimental porcine shock model monitored with Swan-Ganz catheter. Pulmonary hypertension was unexpectedly observed as a complication after intravenous infusion of a contrast agent through the central venous catheter. A similar response was observed in three other animals. Together with the CVP tracings, recordings also included cardiac output, systolic/diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate, and systolic/diastolic arterial pulmonary pressures.
