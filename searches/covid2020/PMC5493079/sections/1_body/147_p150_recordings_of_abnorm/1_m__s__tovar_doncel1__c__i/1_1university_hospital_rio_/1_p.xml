 <bold>Introductions:</bold> A normal central venous pressure (CVP) waveform contains five components. These components include three peaks (a, c, v) and two descents (x, y). The characteristics and amplitude of the CVP waveform components change significantly during cardiovascular distress and its visualization can provide invaluable additional hemodynamic information. We described CVP tracings recorded during an episode of pulmonary hypertension in a porcine model of shock, aiming to characterize the CVP waveform morphology in conjunction with the simultaneous hemodynamic alterations.
