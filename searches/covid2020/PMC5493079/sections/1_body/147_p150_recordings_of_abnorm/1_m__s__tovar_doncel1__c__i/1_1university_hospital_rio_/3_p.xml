 <bold>Results:</bold> The episode of pulmonary hypertension lasted for 3-5 min with spontaneous recovery. The CVP changed from a baseline value of 4-6 mmHg to 16-18 mmHg. The CVP waveform tracings showed abnormal large ‘a’ wave complex resembling a cannon ‘a’ wave of CVP. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig32" ref-type="fig">32</xref> shows the different patterns of the CVP morphology with the different components of the tracing recorded during the entire episode of pulmonary hypertension. A simultaneous ECG is shown to demonstrate the timing of the different components.
