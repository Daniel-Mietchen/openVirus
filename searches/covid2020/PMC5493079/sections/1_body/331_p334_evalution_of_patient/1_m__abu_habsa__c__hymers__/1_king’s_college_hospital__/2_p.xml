<p id="Par3027">The commonest symptom of non-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is sudden onset severe headache. The Emergency Physician is faced with a significant diagnostic challenge by this condition as headache represents 1-2 % of ED attendances while SAH only accounts for 1-3 % of these headaches [1,2]. Conventional practice remains lumbar puncture (LP) sample analysis in patients with a negative CT scan [1]. Recent series in Europe and the United States have demonstrated wide variation in practice as whether an LP is undertaken with no clear guidance on LP omission [2]. We propose a clinical decision tool integrating recent evidence on this patient group.</p>
