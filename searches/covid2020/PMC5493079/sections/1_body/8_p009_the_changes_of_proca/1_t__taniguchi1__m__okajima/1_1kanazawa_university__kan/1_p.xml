 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Procalcitonin (PCT) is an early, sensitive and accurate marker for sepsis. Especially, several studies indicated that PCT is an important indicator to diagnose infection, predict outcomes or guide treatment of abdominal sepsis. Recently, blood purification (BF) such as endotoxin absorption therapy (polymyxin B [PMX] hemoperfusion) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been carried out for abdominal septic shock. However, there are few studies about the changes of PCT levels in abdominal septic shock during BF. Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated the changes of PCT levels in critical patients with abdominal septic shock during BF.
