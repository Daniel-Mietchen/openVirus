 <bold>Results:</bold> Hemodynamics in all patients improved at 8 hrs after BF. The PCT levels were improved (66.0 to 12.7 ng/mL; p &lt; 0.05), but WBC counts (8,420 to 10,380 /uL) and CRP levels (9.3 to 9.0 mg/dL) were not improved 5 days after BF. SOFA scores decreased (12.5 to 7.0; p &lt; 0.05) at 5 days after BF. All patients recovered and discharged in ICU. There was significantly correlation between PCT and SOFA scores (Y = 9.04 + 0.02X; R2 = 0.112, p &lt; 0.0001), but there were no correlation between PCT and other mediators.
