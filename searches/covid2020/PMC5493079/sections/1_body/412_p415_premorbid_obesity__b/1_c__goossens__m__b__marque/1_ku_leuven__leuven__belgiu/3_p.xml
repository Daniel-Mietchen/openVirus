 <bold>Results:</bold> Five days of sepsis reduced body weight similarly in lean and obese mice, with more fat loss in the obese (p &lt; =0.03). Lean CLP mice, but not the obese, showed reduced muscle mass (p &lt; =0.04), muscle protein content (p &lt; =0.06), myofiber size (p &lt; 0.01), and muscle and hepatic triglyceride content (p &lt; =0.06), irrespective of administered feeding. Obese CLP mice maintained normal maximal muscle force, whereas in lean CLP mice, maximal muscle force decreased (p &lt; 0.01) and recovered less from fatigue (p &lt; 0.01). These differences between lean and obese CLP mice coincided with signs of more effective hepatic fatty acid and glycerol metabolism, and ketogenesis in the obese. Also overweight/obese critically ill patients showed preserved myofiber size, while myofiber size reduced in lean patients (p = 0.02 in m. vastus lateralis biopsies, p = 0.01 in m. rectus abdominis biopsies). Furthermore, fewer overweight/obese patients suffered from muscle weakness, assessed 8 days post-ICU admission (p &lt; 0.01).
