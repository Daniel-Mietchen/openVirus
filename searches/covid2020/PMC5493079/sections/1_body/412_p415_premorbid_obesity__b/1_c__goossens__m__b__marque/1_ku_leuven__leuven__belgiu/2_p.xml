 <bold>Methods:</bold> In a centrally-catheterized mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced prolonged septic critical illness, body weight and composition, and muscle wasting were assessed in lean and premorbidly obese mice, each with fasting and parenteral feeding [healthy mice: lean n = 8, obese n = 9; fed CLP mice: lean n = 7, obese n = 10; fasted CLP mice: lean n = 9, obese n = 9]. Muscle weakness was assessed in a second mice experiment examining ex vivo muscle force [healthy mice: lean n = 17, obese n = 15; fed CLP mice: lean n = 15, obese n = 15]. Mice were generated by providing 12-week old male C57BL/6J mice with ad libitum 10% fat chow or 45% fat chow for 12 weeks prior to the septic insult. Also, in matched lean (BMI &lt; =25 kg/m2) and overweight/obese (BMI &gt;25 kg/m2) prolonged critically ill patients and healthy controls, we compared markers of muscle wasting (m. vastus lateralis biopsies (n = 102) and m. rectus abdominis biopsies (n = 86)) as well as muscle weakness, quantified by Medical Research Council sum scores (n = 278).
