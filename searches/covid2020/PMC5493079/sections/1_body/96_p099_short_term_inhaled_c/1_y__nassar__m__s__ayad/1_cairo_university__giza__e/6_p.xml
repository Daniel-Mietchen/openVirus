 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Short duration of adjunctive inhaled colistin shows a significant clearance of the initial organisms, including multi-drug resistant groups, in patients with gram negative ventilator-associated pneumonia. This line of treatment shows a significant decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU mortality when compared with conventional therapy, with no significant added adverse drug reactions. Adjunctive inhaled colistin is safe and effective as an additive therapy in patients with gram-negative ventilator-associated pneumonia.
