 <bold>Methods:</bold> We recruited all patients with a confirmed gram-negative culture and sensitivity taken from Endotracheal (ETT) aspirates after &gt; = 48 hrs of mechanical ventilation and pneumonia clinical criteria: radiological infiltrates, fever, leucocutosis or leucopenia, purulent secretions. Eighty five were randomized to enter either the study group of inhaled colistin (3x 106 IU/day, for 5 days) as an adjunctive therapy to conventional treatment of VAP (n = 52 pts) or enter the control group of conventional therapy only (n = 33 pts). Comparison included microbiological outcome (Day 6 ETT aspirate culture and sensitivity) as well as clinical outcome, clinical pulmonary infection score- CPIS.
