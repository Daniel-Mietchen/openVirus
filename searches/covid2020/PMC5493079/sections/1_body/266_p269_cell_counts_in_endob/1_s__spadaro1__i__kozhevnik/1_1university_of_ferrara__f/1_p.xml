 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by a breakdown of capillary integrity, leading to the leakage of protein-rich fluid and the accumulation of inflammatory cells within the airspaces. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is the commonly used method to obtain lower respiratory tracts samples and to define the role of cells in the inflammatory response in ARDS. However, there is the need to assess the feasibility of using relatively non-invasive endotracheal aspirate (EASP) techniques for cytological studies of the lower respiratory tract in ARDS patients.
