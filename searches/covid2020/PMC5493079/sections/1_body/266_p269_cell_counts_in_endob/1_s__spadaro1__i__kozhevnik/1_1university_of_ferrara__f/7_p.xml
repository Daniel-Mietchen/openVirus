 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> EASP analysis found an increase in neutrophils in bacterial infection vs non-infective ARDS patients. In addition, different risk factors for ARDS were associated with different percentage of macrophages and neutrophils in EASP. Following our preliminary findings, further studies are required to assess if monitoring EASP cellularity over time could be useful to evaluate prognosis in ARDS.
