 <bold>Results:</bold> The number of patients presenting gram-positive cocci, mainly S. aureus, was lower in patients with UVAS (12) than without it (4). The incidence of sepsis was lower with UVAS (3.4 % versus 6.7 %). The 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was significantly lower in patients with UVAS (3.8 %) than without it (6.4 %). Independent factors associated with mortality were age (OR 1.046; 95 % CI 1.007–1.087), emergency surgery (OR 4.684, 95 % CI 2.107–10.415), and the absence of the UVAS (OR 2.396; 95 % CI 1.132–5.074).
