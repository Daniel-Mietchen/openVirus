<p id="Par3145">Over the course of their hospital stay, 1991 patients (28.19 %; 95%CI 27.16 to 29.25)) received RBC transfusions among 7062 patients suffering from traumatic brain injury, with frequencies varying from 0 to 43 % between centers. Female gender, age 55-65 (in reference to patients aged &lt; 55), anemia, coagulopathy, sepsis, bleeding, hypovolemic shock, presence of multiple other comorbidities, face, thoracic and abdominal, spine, lower extremities and skin injuries, as well as invasive interventions were associated with higher frequency of RBC transfusions. Trauma severity and invasive interventions explained 76 % of the observed variation. Mortality, complications and discharge elsewhere than home were increased in patients who received RBC transfusions. ICU length of stay and hospital length of stay were also longer in patients who received RBC transfusions. When stratified, patients who were anemic on admission showed neither benefit nor disadvantage on any outcome relative to RBC transfusions. Similar results were obtained for stratum of patients who were diagnosed with sepsis on admission.</p>
