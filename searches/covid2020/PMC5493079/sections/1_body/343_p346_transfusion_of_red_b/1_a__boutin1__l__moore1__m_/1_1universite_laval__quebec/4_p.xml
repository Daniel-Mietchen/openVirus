<p id="Par3143">We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study using data from the National Trauma Registry of Canada. All patients admitted with a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury to one of the 114 participating centers from 2005 to 2013 were eligible. The registry contains information on age, gender, trauma severity, discharge status and discharge disposition. Data from the Discharge Abstract Database containing information on blood products, comorbidities, interventions and complications were linked to NTR observations. We conducted multivariate robust Poisson regression with a random effect at the center level. Missing data were handled through multiple imputation techniques.</p>
