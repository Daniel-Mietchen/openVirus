 <bold>Results:</bold> 15 patients were enrolled on a multidisciplinary ICU, with age of 63±9 years, male/female ratio was 9/6. Out of the 16 measurements/patient, 240 MEL samples were analysed. MEL and illuminance levels are summarised in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig106" ref-type="fig">106</xref>. Although illuminance was the lowest at 01:00, but levels were still a lot higher than physiologically required. Furthermore, at 01:00 a MEL peak should occur [1], which was also missing. A repeated correlation analysis between MEL serum concentration and illuminance levels showed a weak within-subject correlation (r = -0.097, P = 0.152), and a still non-significant between-subject correlation (r = 0.438, P = 0.103).
