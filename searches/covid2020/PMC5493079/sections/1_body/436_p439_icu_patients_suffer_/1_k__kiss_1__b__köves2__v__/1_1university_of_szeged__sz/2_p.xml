 <bold>Methods:</bold> Mechanically ventilated patients over 18 years, without brain injury were enrolled into the study in January 2015. Illuminance was measured by a lux meter over the patients’ body and serum MEL levels were determined from blood samples. Measurements took place after admission starting with the closest time point of the regular sampling period of 01:00, 07:00, 13:00 and 19:00 hours with a precision of ±10 min. for 4 days. Blood samples were kept in total darkness until clotting before being centrifuged 8 min. at 3000 rpm, then serum samples were placed into -80 °C until MEL measurement was performed.
