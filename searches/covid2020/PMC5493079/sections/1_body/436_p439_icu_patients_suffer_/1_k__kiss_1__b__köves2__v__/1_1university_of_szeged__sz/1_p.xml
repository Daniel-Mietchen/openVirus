 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Circadian rhythm has a profound role in harmonising the function of organs and cells of the human body, while disruption of this rhythm (i.e. chronodisruption) is accompanied with a wide spectrum of pathological conditions. This rhythm in healthy subjects is mainly orchestrated by the daily cycles of light and darkness, as shown by the elevation of melatonin (MEL) levels peaking at dawn [1]. The aim of our prospective clinical study was to examine the rhythm of MEL release in ICU patients suffering from continuous light pollution.
