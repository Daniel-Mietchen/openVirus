 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate that circadian rhythm is desynchronized in ICU patients, as indicated by a) the missing MEL peak during the night; b) by the poor correlation between illumination and MEL levels c) the absence of the normal 24h rhythm of MEL release. Future trials are hence warranted to test whether providing physiological light/dark conditions could resynchronise circadian rhythm and if it has any effect on patient outcomes.
