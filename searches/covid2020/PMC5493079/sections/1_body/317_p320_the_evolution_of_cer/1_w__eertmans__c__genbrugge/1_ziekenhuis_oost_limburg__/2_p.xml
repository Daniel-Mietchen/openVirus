<p id="Par2891">Regardless of the recent advances in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and post-resuscitation care, most patients who die during their hospital stay after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) decease due to post-anoxic neurological injury. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides information on regional brain oxygenation by measuring the regional cerebral oxygen saturation (SctO2) and offers the possibility to determine changes in the balance between oxygen delivery and uptake in the frontal lobe of the brain. The aim of the study was to monitor SctO2 for 48Â hours in OHCA patients during targeted temperature management (TTM).</p>
