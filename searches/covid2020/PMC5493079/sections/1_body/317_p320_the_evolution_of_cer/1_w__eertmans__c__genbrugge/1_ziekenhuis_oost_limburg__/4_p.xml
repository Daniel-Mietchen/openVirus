<p id="Par2893">A prospective, observational study was performed during therapeutic hypothermia (TH; 24 hours at 33 °C, followed by rewarming at 0.3 °C/h over 12 hours) in 107 successfully resuscitated OHCA patients. SctO2 was continuously monitored with NIRS for 48 hours using the FORE-SIGHT
 <sup>TM</sup> (CAS Medical systems, Branford, CT, USA). The Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale was used to define patient’s outcome at 180 days after OHCA, where CPC 1-2 and CPC 3-5 represented a good and poor outcome, respectively. Data are reported as mean ± SD. A student t-test was performed as appropriate and a mixed model was created to analyze continuous SctO2 data over time.
