<p id="Par2895">While 50 patients (47 %) survived with a good neurological outcome, 57 patients (53 %) corresponded to a CPC score of 5. The mean SctO2 at ICU admission was 64 % ± 7 for survivors compared to 66 % ± 6 for non-survivors (p = 0.184). After initiation of TH, an important decrease was observed in both groups with a lowest SctO2 of 62 % at hour 3 for survivors and 61 % at hour 5 for non-survivors (p = 0.432). This was followed by a progressive increase towards baseline values. With respect to non-survivors who regained baseline SctO2-values at 22 hours (66 % ± 6), survivors already reached baseline values within 12 hours (65 % ± 6). All SctO2-values were fitted in a linear mixed model and a significant time effect was observed during the course of SctO2 after adjustment for age and gender (p &lt; 0.001). We found that SctO2-values of non-survivors followed a linear course over time, whereas SctO2-values of survivors could be fitted in a logarithmic curve.</p>
