 <bold>Results:</bold> 195 patients were included according to those criteria. 5 were excluded from analysis because of a non-confirmed diagnosis. Among the 190 patients analyzed, 15 had a diagnosis of thromboembolic disease, resulting in a prevalence of 7,89 % (IC95% = 4,49 %-12,69 %). 4 had a negative D-dimer level with the conventional cutoff (&lt;500 μg/L) and 15 (all of them) had a negative d-dimer level with the age-adjusted cutoff. The sensitivity of the conventional cutoff was 73,33 % (IC95% = 44,90 %-92,21 %) and the sensitivity of the age-adjusted cutoff was 0 % (IC95% = 0,00 %-21,80 %).
