 <bold>Methods:</bold> Files from patients who visited the emergency department of Hôpital Sacré-Coeur de Montréal between March 2008 and May 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients aged 50 and older with COPD and with a non-high pretest probability of thromboembolic disease were included. These patients all had a D-dimer measurement and a radiologic exam (pulmonary angioscan, ventilation/perfusion lung scan or a lower extremity doppler). The results are presented in proportions with 95 % confidence intervals without continuity correction and with sensitivity measurements.
