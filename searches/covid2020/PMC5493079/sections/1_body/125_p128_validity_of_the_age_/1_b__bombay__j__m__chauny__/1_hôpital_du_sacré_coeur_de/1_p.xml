 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Diagnosing thromboembolic disease represents a challenge in older patients with COPD. The ADJUST-PE study has recently validated a new age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff (age x 10) in patients older than 50Â years old. When the results of this study are cautiously analyzed, it seems that the validity of this cutoff in patients with COPD is unreliable. The objective of the current study was to specifically validate or invalidate the use of the age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in patients with COPD aged 50 or older.
