 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Severe liver failure is common and carries a high mortality risk in patients with both acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure. Extracorporeal liver support therapy (ECLST) could be one of the treatment option. But despite proven biochemical efficacy, there are little data regarding clinical end points. We show our experience for more than six years in our ICU.
