 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> ACF and ACFL have high mortality rate without liver transplant, although extracorporeal liver support therapy improved total bilirubin, creatinine and BUN. Nevertheless, the value of extracorporeal liver support remains to be corroborated by further clinical studies that include the optimal timing, mode, intensity and duration of this treatment.
