The length of stay (LOS) was 12.40 ± 11.54 in the ICU and 35.13 ± 31.04 days in the hospital.

After ECLST there was a decrease in total bilirubin (24.99 ± 5.61 mg/dL to 15.15 ± 4.38 mg/dL, p &lt; 0.0001), creatinine (1.01 ± 1.044 mg/dL to 0.63 ± 0.732 mg/dL, p &lt; 0.001), BUN (49.59 ± 40.95 mg/dL to 25.14 ± 20.89 mg/dL, p &lt;0.0001) and platelets (69.000 ± 50.800/mm3 to 54.000 ± 34.800/mm3, p &lt;0.005). The global mortality rate was 60 %. 33 % of the patients (5) were submitted to a liver transplante, with a mortality rate of 0 %, wether the mortality rate in the patients without liver transplant was 90 %.
