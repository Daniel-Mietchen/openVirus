<p id="Par3050">From 886 screened patients, a total of 527 (59.5 %) with aSAH were included in our study. Mean (±SD) age was 57 ± 13 years; 357 (67.7 %) were female. Median presenting Fisher Grade was 4 (IQR 3-4). Aneurysms were secured in 90.1 % of patients (52.2 % by endovascular coiling, and 39.7 % by surgical clipping). Mean nadir hemoglobin was 98 ± 20 g/L and occurred on median post-admission day (PAD) 4 (IQR 2-11). RBCTx occurred in 100 patients (19.0 %). RBCTx rates varied across centres (12.1-27.4 %, p = 0.02). A median 1 unit of RBCs (IQR 1-2) was administered per transfusion episode and patients received a median total of 2 units (IQR 1-4). Median pre-transfusion hemoglobin for first transfusion was 79 g/L (IQR 74-93) and did not vary substantially across centres (78-82 g/L, p = 0.37). Of patients with nadir Hb &lt; 80 g/L, 65.8 % received an RBCTx compared to 7.0 % with Hb nadir &gt; =100 g/L (p &lt; 0.0001). Univariate predictors of RBCTx were increasing age, anterior circulation aneurysm, lower presenting GCS, advanced Fisher Grade, neurosurgical clipping and lower Hb.</p>
