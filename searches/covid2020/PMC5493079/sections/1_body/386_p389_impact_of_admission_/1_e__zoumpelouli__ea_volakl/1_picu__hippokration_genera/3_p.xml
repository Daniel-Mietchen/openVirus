 <bold>Results:</bold> 1977 pts, 57.5 % male, aged 55.51 ± 50.28 mo (mean ± SD, median 40) were recorded. The main reasons for admission were respiratory failure (26 %), postoperative care (15.7 %), seisures (11.5 %), head trauma (11.2 %), coma (8 %), polytrauma (6.5 %), sepsis (4.7 %), cardiovascular (4.5 %), accidents (3.9 %), MODS (3.7 %), miscellaneous (2.9 %) and metabolic (1.5 %). LOS was 11.35 ± 26.64 days (median 5) and mortality at discharge 14.36 %. Age (p = 0,742), infancy (p = 0.204), readmissions (p = 0.793), co-morbidities (p = 0.969), season of admission (p = 0.560) and time of admission (p = 0.353) did not play a role on the mortality. On the contrary, mortality was significantly related to sex (male 12.1 % vs. female 17.6 %, p = 0.003), emergency admissions (16.7 % vs. 3.1 %, p = 0.000), source of admission (p = 0.000), and reason for admission (p = 0.003). Internal pediatric pts had the highest mortality (25.7 %), followed by other in city hospital (11.5 %), remote peripheral hospital (12.2 %) and internal surgical (8.6 %). Moreover, outcome was worse for MODS (mortality 65.3 %), cardiovascular (43.2 %), sepsis (27.5 %), coma (24.2 %) and metabolic (21.4 %) pts. Non survivors stayed significantly longer (16.38 ± 36.52 vs. 9.97 ± 13.92 days, p = 0.000).
