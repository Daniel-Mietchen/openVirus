 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results are in accordance with data that attribute higher mortality in internal pts, which is partially expected in tertiary care hospitals like ours. Season and time of admission did not have a significant impact on the outcome, indicating a high level of care even under suboptimal conditions where resources are restricted, as happened during holidays and out-of-hours admissions.
