 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The similarities in the phenotype induced by sepsis and suppression of A1R support our hypothesis that dysfunction/down-regulation of the Gi-A1R at the onset of sepsis changes the effect of adenosine towards Gs-A2AR/A2BR-mediated leukopenia and immune paralysis. Suppression of IL-15 might be a part of the mechanism of leukopenia observed in CLP-treated mice and A1R-/- mice.
