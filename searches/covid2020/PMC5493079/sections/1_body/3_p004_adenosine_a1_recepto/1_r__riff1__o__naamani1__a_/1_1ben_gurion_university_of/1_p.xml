 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Most patients survive the initial hyper-inflammatory phase of severe sepsis and reach an intensive care unit with immunosuppression. Adenosine, a potent modulator of in fl;ammation and immunity is strongly elevated in blood of septic patients. We have previously shown that adenosine A1 receptor (A1R, Gi receptor) dominates the pro-inflammatory phase of bacterial peritonitis and that activation of this receptor by a specific agonist induces A2AR (Gs) expression and dominance during the resolution phase of inflammation. In this study we aimed to elucidate the role of adenosine and its receptors in sepsis-associated leukopenia. We hypothesized that elevated adenosine levels in sepsis affects the normal development of lymphocytes through down-regulation of A1R.
