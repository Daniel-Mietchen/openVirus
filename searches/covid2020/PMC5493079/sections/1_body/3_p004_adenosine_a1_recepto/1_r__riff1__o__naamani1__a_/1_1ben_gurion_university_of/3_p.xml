 <bold>Results:</bold> CLP-treated mice exhibited significantly lower number of WBC compared to sham controls (9.15 ± 2.65 vs. 3.21 ± 1.58 cells x10^3/μl). Sham A1R-/- mice showed lower WBC counts compared to sham WT littermate (4.5 ± 3.24 cells x10^3/μl, p &lt; .05). No significant difference was observed in WBC count between the sham A1R-/- and CLP WT groups. Similarly, desensitization of A1R by agonist (CCPA) or elimination of A1R with A1R antagonist (DCPCX) were associated with leukopenia. The T-cell was the main cell population affected by CLP and A1R elimination. Apoptotic rate of nucleated BM cells in sham A1R-/- mice was similar to the rate observed in WT CLP mice, and almost 2-fold greater than the early apoptosis rate (Annexin V+, 7-ADD-) shown in WT sham group (3.64 ± 1.23 % vs. 1.86 ± 0.59 %, respectively, p &lt; .05). Interestingly, CLP-A1R-/- mice were shown to produce less interleukin (IL)-15 in lavage fluid compared to CLP-WT mice (8.8 ± 6.0 vs. 35.3 ± 9.8 pg/ml, respectively p &lt; .001).
