 <bold>Methods:</bold> All patients with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia admitted to a UK district hospital ICU over a one-year period up to 31/10/14 were retrospectively reviewed to determine which investigations had been requested within 24 hours of admission. These were compared to the BTS guideline [1]. We subsequently implemented the ‘BUNS pneumonia screen’ within our electronic investigation system. A single click auto-generated request labels for all tests in the BTS guidelines. After implementation and staff education, we repeated the data collection between 1/2/15 and 1/11/15.
