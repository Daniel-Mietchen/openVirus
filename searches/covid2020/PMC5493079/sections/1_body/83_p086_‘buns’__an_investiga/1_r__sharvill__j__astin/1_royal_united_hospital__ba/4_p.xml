 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study has shown that a computerised auto-generated set of investigation requests, aided by an easily remembered acronym, lead to increased proportion of patients (85 % vs 28 %) receiving prompt and consistent ‘gold standard’ investigations for pneumonia. We believe this reduced duplication and delay in obtaining diagnostic results, thereby improving patient care. We suggest the ‘Bundle of BUNS’ could be easily replicated in other ICUs, and a similar system could be introduced for other presenting conditions.
