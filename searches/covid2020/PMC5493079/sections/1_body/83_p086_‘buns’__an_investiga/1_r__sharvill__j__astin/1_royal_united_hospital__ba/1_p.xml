 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Pneumonia is a major cause for ICU admission and mortality. Prompt investigation facilitates tailored antimicrobial strategy, guides management, and aids prognostication. The British Thoracic Society (BTS)[1] suggest specific tests are performed for patients with severe pneumonia: Legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigens, sputum and blood cultures, respiratory viral PCR swabs, and atypical serology testing. We suspected these tests were inconsistently undertaken or delayed in our ICU, and introduced a computerised pneumonia screen, ‘BUNS’, (Blood cultures and viral serology/Urinary antigens/Nasal +/- endotracheal viral swab/Sputum sample) to consistently investigate this condition.
