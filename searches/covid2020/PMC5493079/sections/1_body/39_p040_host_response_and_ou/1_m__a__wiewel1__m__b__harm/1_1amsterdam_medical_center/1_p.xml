 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Hypothermia is associated with adverse outcome in patients with sepsis. Knowledge on the pathophysiology is highly limited. The objective of this study was to establish whether hypothermia was associated with differences in the systemic host response to sepsis as reflected by cytokine profile, endothelial activation markers and cellular responsiveness towards lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during the first days of intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
