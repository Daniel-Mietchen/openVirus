 <bold>Results:</bold> Hypothermia was identified in 186 of 525 patients and was independently associated with increased mortality in multivariate analysis. At baseline, patients with hypothermic sepsis were significantly older, had a lower body mass index and increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were not different between groups at all time points. Hypothermia was also not associated with an altered response to ex vivo stimulation with LPS in a subset of patients. Hypothermia was associated with sustained elevated levels of the endothelial activation marker fractalkine during the first 4Â days of ICU stay compared to nonhypothermic patients in both the entire cohort and the cohort matched for disease severity.
