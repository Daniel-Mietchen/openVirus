 <bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective observational study in patients with sepsis on ICUs of 2 tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands. Hypothermia was defined as the lowest body temperature measurement below 36 °C in the first 24 hours of ICU admission. Exclusion criteria were immunodeficiency, active cooling, readmission or admission from operating theatre or other ICU. Logistic regression was used to investigate the independent association of hypothermia with 90-day mortality. Plasma levels of endothelial markers and cytokine levels were measured upon ICU admission and at days 2 and 4 thereafter in all hypothermic and nonhypothermic patients with sepsis. Analyses were performed in the entire cohort as well as a cohort matched for disease severity. LPS ex vivo whole blood stimulation was performed on day 1 of admission in a subset of patients.
