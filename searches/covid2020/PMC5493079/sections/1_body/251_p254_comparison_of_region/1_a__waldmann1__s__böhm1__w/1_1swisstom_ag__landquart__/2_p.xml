 <bold>Methods:</bold> In ten intubated patients with hypoxemic and hypercapnia lung failure time constants (τ = R·C) were estimated from global and regional volume EIT signals obtained by Swisstom BB
 <sup>2</sup> (Swisstom, Switzerland). A first order exponential decay model was fitted to each regional and global impedance curve using MATLAB (The MathWorks, USA). The spread and mean of regional τ values is depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig68" ref-type="fig">68</xref> and compared with the one τ value derived from the global signal.
