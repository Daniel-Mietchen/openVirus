 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Although regional compliance (C) and resistance (R) can vary considerably between different lung regions, traditional pulmonary function tests can measure global values, only. To overcome this drawback we recently proposed a novel EIT-based method to estimate regional expiratory time constants (τ = tau). In this abstract regional values were compared with global ones.
