 <bold>Results:</bold> ARDS lungs exhaled “faster” whereas COPD lungs were “slower”, the latter reflecting the predominance of airway obstruction. ARDS patients show only minor regional differences and global τ corresponded perfectly with the mean τ derived from different lung regionals. In contrast, COPD patients showed a large spread of their regional τ values. Nonetheless, the mean of the regional τ values corresponded well with global τ .
