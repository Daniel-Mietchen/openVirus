 <bold>Results:</bold> Results obtained from 14 treatments with Unasyn® demonstrate that from the onset of the infusion the QT-interval increases additionally up to 39 ms (p &lt; 0,05). This variation persisted for the first three minutes of therapy and returns during the next two minutes to their pre-values. Other ECG data remained unchanged during the time of treatment.
