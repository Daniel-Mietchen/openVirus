 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Haemodynamic alterations – QT-interval prolongation - could be detected with onset of antibiotic treatment with Unasyn®. The similar antibiotic Tazonam® showed in another study of us no significant beat-to-beat changes. With regard to comorbidities of ICU patients, it seems reasonable that changes in cardiac electric activity might be observed even earlier during their ICU stay.
