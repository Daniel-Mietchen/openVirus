 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the present ovine model of septic shock, all groups developed sepsis-associated USKD. Animals of the colloid-groups (albumin and 6Â % HES 130/0.4) showed significantly decreased injury scores as compared to the animals of the control- and crystalloid-group. Ultrastructural kidney damage was most pronounced within crystalloid- and control-group in this study.
