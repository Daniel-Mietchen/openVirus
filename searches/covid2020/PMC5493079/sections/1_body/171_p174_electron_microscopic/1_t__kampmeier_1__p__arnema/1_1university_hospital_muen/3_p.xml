 <bold>Results:</bold> All groups developed USKD over time with consecutive increases of EMTI scores. At BL2 + 6 h, the EMTI score of the HES-group was significantly lower as compared to crystalloid- and control-group (each p &lt; 0.05) and at BL2 + 12 h the EMTI scores of albumin- and HES-groups were significantly lower as compared to the control group (each p &lt; 0.01). 24 h after BL2, the EMTI score of the human albumin-group was significantly lower as compared to the control- and crystalloid-group (each p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences between albumin- and HES-group at any time.
