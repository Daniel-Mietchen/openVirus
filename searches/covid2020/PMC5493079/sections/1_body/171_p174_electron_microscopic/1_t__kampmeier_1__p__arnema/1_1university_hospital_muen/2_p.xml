 <bold>Methods:</bold> After approval by the local veterinary authorities, 20 healthy, female sheep underwent induction of peritoneal septic shock following an established model and consecutive randomization to one of the study groups: 1) control (no fluid therapy), 2) balanced crystalloids (Jonosteril©), 3) 5 % human albumin (Humanalbin©), 4) balanced 6 % HES 130/0.4 (Volulyte©) [each n = 5]. For dynamic detection of USKD, sequential sonography-guided kidney needle biopsies were performed at both healthy and septic baseline (BL1, BL2), as well as 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after the start of resuscitation. Analyses of the n = 1000 electronic microscopy pictures (10 pictures per time point (n = 5) and animal (n = 20)) were performed by two blinded, independent investigators following the “electron microscopic tubular injury“ (EMTI) score. The score contains the parameters 1) vacuolar alterations, 2) dissociation of epithelium and basal membrane, 3) epithelial cell injury, 4) intratubular precipitation and 5) intact microvilli cuticular layer. Each component of the score was quantified from 0 (no damage) to 3 (severe damage).
