 <bold>Methods:</bold> We included ARDS patients (P/F &lt; 200) under mechanical ventilation sedated and paralyzed. An open-lung protocol consisting of a 4-step recruitment maneuver (from 25 to 40 cm of PEEP) and a decremental PEEP titration (to find the best PEEP named open-lung PEEP) was performed after ruling out hypovolemia. We recorded mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), right-to-left ventricle diameter ratio (RV/LV) using echocardiography, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), aortic velocity time integral (VTI), systolic lateral RV annulus velocity (S) during the recruitment maneuver at 40 cmH2O and 1 hour and 24 hours after this maneuver at the chosen best PEEP (open-lung PEEP).
