 <bold>Results:</bold> 10 patients with ARDS (age 55 ± 13, SAPS 70 ± 15) were included. The median PEEP increased from 9 (6.0 – 13.5) cmH2O at baseline to 21.0 cmH2O (16.0 – 23.0) (p &lt; 0.01) at openlung PEEP. PO2/FiO2 increased from 70.6 (40.6 – 89.6) to 209 (141 – 229), p &lt; 0.01. RV/LV increased from 0.70 [0.58 – 0.75] to 0.80 [0.73 – 0.83], p = 0.02, during PEEP of 40cmH2O and returned to baseline values (0.75 [0.63 – 0.89], p = 0.10) at open-lung PEEP. The TAPSE decreased from 18 [17 – 21]mm to 16 [15 – 17]mm (p = 0.02) at a peep of 40 cmH2O, returned to baseline 18 [17 – 19]mm at open-lung and remained stable 24 hours later. S presented the same pattern. MAP dropped from 89 [73– 95]mmHg at baseline to 70[60– 81]mmHg (p = 0,01 vs baseline) during the last step of recruitment, was 70 [69–77]mmHg at open-lung PEEP, and was 79[67– 84]mmHg 24 hours later. CO decreased from 5.9 l.min-1 (IQR 4.6 – 7.3) to 4.4 l.min-1 (IQR 3.5 – 6.4) during recruitment but returned to baseline value at openlung PEEP (5.6 l.min-1 (IQR 4.4 – 7.1)) and remained stable at 24 hours. Ejection fraction was unchanged at open-lung PEEP and at 24 hours, compared with baseline value.
