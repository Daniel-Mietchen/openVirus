 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Protective ventilatory strategies for ARDS with lower tidal volumes and higher PEEPs may benefit the lung. But high PEEP may induce right ventricular (RV) dysfunction which may severely impair hemodynamic. We hypothesized that opening the lung with recruitment maneuver, followed by maintaining high PEEP may be good for the lung and for the heart.
