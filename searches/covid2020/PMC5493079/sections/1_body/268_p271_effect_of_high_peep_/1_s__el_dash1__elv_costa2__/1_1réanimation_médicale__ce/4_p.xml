 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In our ARDS patients, recruitment maneuver permitted to open the lung with an increase of P/F and apply high PEEP of 21 cmH20 to maintain the lung open. The right ventricular function was not impaired, confirming that what is good for the lung may be not deleterious for the heart.
