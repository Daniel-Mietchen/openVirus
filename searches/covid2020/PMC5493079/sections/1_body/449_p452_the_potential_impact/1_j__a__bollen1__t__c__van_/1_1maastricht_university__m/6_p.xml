 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this first analysis of Belgian data on euthanasia in order to explore the potential of organ donation after euthanasia, 10,3% of all euthanasia cases are potentially suitable patients for donation. Whether they are willing to donate is unclear and should be studied. If only a small percentage of these patients would consider donation, this could mean an increase in donation in Belgium and the Netherlands.
