<p id="Par3975">Exclusion was based on the contraindications for donation within the Eurotransplant region. Cancer was an exclusion criterion as the majority of malignancies are a contra-indication for organ donation. Patients with “Multiple pathologies” were excluded, because they would be unlikely to be accepted as an organ donor. Patients with “Other pathologies” were excluded, because many mentioned contra-indications for donation or details about the pathology were lacking. For subgroup analysis, patients with renal disease were excluded as potential kidney donors and patients with lung disease as potential lung donors.</p>
