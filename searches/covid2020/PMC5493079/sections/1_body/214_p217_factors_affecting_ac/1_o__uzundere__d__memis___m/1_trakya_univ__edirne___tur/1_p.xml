 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Early detecting acute renal failure in intensive care units is important by the aspect of determination of the diseaseâ€™s severity and grade of the organ dysfuncion, discharging the patient from the intensive care units and decreasing mortality rate. The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative workgroup proposed a classification system for acute kidney injury (AKI) identified by the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease). The purpose of our study is to assess acute renal failure development in intensive care units patients, factors affecting it and the effect of the factors over mortality via using RIFLE score.
