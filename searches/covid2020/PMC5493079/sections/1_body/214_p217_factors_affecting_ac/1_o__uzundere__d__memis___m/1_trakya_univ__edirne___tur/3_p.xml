 <bold>Results:</bold> Our study was carried out with 502 patients. 39,2 % of the patients was in the acute kidney ýnjury group while %60.8 was in non- acute kidney ýnjury group. acute kidney ýnjury group was consisting of % 21,3 (n = 107) R group, % 12,4 (n = 62) I group and % 5,6 (n = 28) F group. The renal failure development is related with high age, short body height, excessive weight, existence of chronic disease and long intensive care units hospitalization period. As a result of our study renal failure was also related with high urea, creatinine, HCO3- levels, low cholesterol, albumine and prealbumine levels. Renal failure was not related with triceps thickness measurement. Intensive care units hospitalization stay and mortality were higher in patients who develop renal failure.
