 <bold>Results:</bold> We identified 14 patients with severe hypernatraemia over the past two years in our Critical Care Unit. The plasma sodium range was 160 to 196 mmol/L. All values &gt; 170 mmol/L occurred in patients with hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS). The underlying aetiology was as follows: 4 (28.6 %) patients HHS, 1 (7.1 %) patient diabetic ketoacidosis, 1 (7.1 %) patient lithium-induced diabetes insipidus and 8 (57.1 %) patients with dehydration secondary to unreplaced water loses. In no case was the rate of correction greater than 10 mmol/L per day. The average length of time for correction to normal sodium level of 145 mmol/L was 6 days. Three patients (21.4 %) died in Critical Care. Two patients (14.3 %) died following discharge to the ward. The remaining 9 patients (64.3 %) were discharged home to their primary residence. All patients had neurological symptoms on presentation, primarily confusion. One patient presented with seizures. All patients were treated with 5 % dextrose. One patient developed hypernatraemia in Critical Care. Moderately elevated sodium levels were untreated in this patient prior to the diagnosis of severe hypernatraemia. The remaining patients all presented with hypernatraemia.
