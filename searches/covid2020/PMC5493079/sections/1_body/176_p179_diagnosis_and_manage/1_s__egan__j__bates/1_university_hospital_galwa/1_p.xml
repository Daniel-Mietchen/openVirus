 <bold>Introductions:</bold> The development of hypernatraemia leads to hypertonic stress within the cells. Previous studies have shown that the presence of hypernatraemia on admission to Intensive Care is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. While rapid correction of hypernatraemia can have devastating neurological consequences; a correction speed too slow is associated with an increased risk of death. The primary objective was to assess the frequency of severe hypernatraemia in patients admitted to our Critical Care Unit, located in a tertiary referral centre and university hospital. Time to sodium normalisation, presence/absence of neurological symptoms and patient outcome was also evaluated. Severe hypernatraemia was classified as plasma sodium ≥160 mmol per litre.
