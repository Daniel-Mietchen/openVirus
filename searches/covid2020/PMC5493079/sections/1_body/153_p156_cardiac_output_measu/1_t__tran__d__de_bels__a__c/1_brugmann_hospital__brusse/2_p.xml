 <bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively evaluated transthoracic echocardiography examinations of critically ill patients performed between 2013-2014. The stroke volume (SV) was calculated using left ventricular outflow tract diameter and flow velocity time integral (DT) and was compared to stroke volume estimated from the difference between the end diastolic and end systolic volume measured by Simpson biplane method (S2D). We excluded patients with atrial fibrillation and any significant valvulopathy. Low end diastolic value (EDV) was considered as a volume &lt;70 cc and low ejection fraction (EF) was defined &lt;45 %.
