 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> A significant overestimation of stroke volume measured with Doppler ultrasound by transthoracic echocardiography compared to S2D was observed in critically ill patients. This overestimation was more prominent between the patients with low end-diastolic volume and/or low EF. Given that none of the two methods that we used can be considered as gold standard a further evaluation of DT should be made in this group of patients. Conversely, in every day clinical practice, the combination of these two methods may be an easy way to identify possible errors in cardiac output measurements.
