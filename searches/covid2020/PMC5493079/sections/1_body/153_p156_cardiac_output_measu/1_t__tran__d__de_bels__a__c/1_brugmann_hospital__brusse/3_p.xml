 <bold>Results:</bold> We evaluated 147 exams. Twenty patients were excluded because of atrial fibrillation and 41 because of a significant valvulopathy. A total 86 pairs of stroke volumes measured by the two methods were evaluated. The r value was 0.51, r^2 = 0.25 and p &lt; 0.01 by regression analysis. The mean bias of stroke volume measured with DT over that estimated with S2D was 29 % (95 % CI 21.4-37.5, p &lt; 0.01). There was a negative correlation of this bias with mean SV (r^2 = 0.09, p &lt; 0.01). A negative linear correlation was found between the bias and the end-diastolic volume and EF but not with end-systolic volume (r^2 = 0.21 p &lt; 0.01, r^2 = 0.15 p &lt; 0.01 and r^2 = 0.01 p = 0.93, respectively). A higher bias was observed in patients with low EF (46 % ± 33 vs 25 % ± 36 p0.03) and in patients with low end-diastolic volume (64 % ± 33 vs 20 % ± 31 p &lt; 0.01).
