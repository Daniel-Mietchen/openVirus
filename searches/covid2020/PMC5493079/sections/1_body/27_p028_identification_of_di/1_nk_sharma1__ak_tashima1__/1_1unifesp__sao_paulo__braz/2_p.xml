 <bold>Methods:</bold> In the present study, we used quantitative proteomic approach (iTRAQ) to identify differential expression from survival and non-survival septic patients secondary to CAP and HAP. In brief, the plasma samples were depleted for high abundant proteins, trypsin digested and labelled with iTRAQ 8plex system. The tryptic peptides were separated by SCX chromatography and analysed with LC-MS. The collected data processed and submitted to mascot search engine with selection of swissprot database and 1Â % FDR. The results from mascot were further analysed by isobaric Q.
