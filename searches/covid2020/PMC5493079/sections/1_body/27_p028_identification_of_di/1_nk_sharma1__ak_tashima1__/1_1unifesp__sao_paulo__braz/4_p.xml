 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study provides the first molecular level evidence of differential response in septic patients secondary to CAP and HAP. The results show higher numbers of unique proteins to corresponding groups. Underlying diseases, previous therapeutic interventions and different etiology may underscore the differences observed at a protein level.
