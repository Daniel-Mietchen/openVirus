 <bold>Results:</bold> The proteome profile unable us to indentify total 64 and 61 differentially expressed proteins in CAP and HAP survival patients, while, 68 and 75 protein were identified in CAP and HAP non survival patients. Total 26 proteins were common in survival patients, whereas 38 and 35 proteins were specific for CAP and HAP, respectively. Total 33 proteins were common in non survival patients, whereas 35 and 42 proteins were specific for CAP and HAP, respectively. On the comparison of proteins across all groups, 21 proteins were common; 12 and 10 proteins were specific to CAP and HAP survival, while, 13 and 16 protein were unique to CAP and HAP non survival groups. These proteins are key molecules for various biological functions including inflammatory response as well as signalling cascade like acute phase response etc. The further analysis and validation is in progress.
