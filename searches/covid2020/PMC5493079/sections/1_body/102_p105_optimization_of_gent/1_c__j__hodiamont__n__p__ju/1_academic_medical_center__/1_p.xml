 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Despite the administration of body-weight standardized starting doses of gentamicin, a wide range in peak concentration (Cpeak) is generally observed in critically ill patients resulting from variable pharmacokinetics of gentamicin between patients and within a patient over time. This may hamper the efficacy of gentamicin treatment. The aims of this study were 1) to determine the percentage of patients that reached a target Cpeak level of 15-20Â mg/L after the first dose as well as after subsequent doses during which therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was applied and 2) to quantify the impact of several patient parameters on the volume of distribution (Vd) of gentamicin, which is correlated with Cpeak.
