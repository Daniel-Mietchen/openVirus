 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> 39 % of gentamicin Cpeak were below the therapeutic range after a first median dose of 4.9 mg/kg in critically ill patients, suggesting that higher doses are indicated. Patients with hypoalbuminaemia are at increased risk for achieving suboptimal gentamicin Cpeak, suggesting that gentamicin dose should be increased for patients with hypoalbuminaemia. Since gross fluctuations in Cpeak were observed over time within patients, Cpeak should be measured repeatedly when patients receive gentamicin treatment for more than 2 days.
