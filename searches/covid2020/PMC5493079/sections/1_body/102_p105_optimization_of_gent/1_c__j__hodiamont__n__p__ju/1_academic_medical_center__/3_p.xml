 <bold>Results:</bold> With a median starting dose of 4.9 mg/kg, 39 % of Cpeak were subtherapeutic after the first dose (n = 59 patients). In total, 52 % of 131 Cpeak were not within the therapeutic range of 15-20 mg/L during the course of therapy. Of the 20 cases with subsequent Cpeak values and no dose adjustment, 6 (30 %) changed from non-therapeutic to therapeutic and 3 (15 %) changed from therapeutic to non-therapeutic Cpeak. Even after performing TDM, 24 % of subsequent doses resulted in subtherapeutic and 24 % in supratherapeutic levels. Analysis was performed retrospectively on 303 gentamicin concentration measurements from 44 critically ill patients receiving 174 doses. Albumin serum level was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) associated with Vd and with Cpeak. Most patients with albumin levels below 15 mg/L did not obtain therapeutic Cpeak.
