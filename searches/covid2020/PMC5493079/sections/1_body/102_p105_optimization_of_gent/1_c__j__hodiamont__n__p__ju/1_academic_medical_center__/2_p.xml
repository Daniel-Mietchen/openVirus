 <bold>Methods:</bold> Blood samples were prospectively collected and analysed by nonlinear mixed-effects modelling (NONMEM) to estimate Vd and Cpeak for every administration during a course of gentamicin therapy. Clinical data and routinely collected serum gentamicin levels from critically ill patients were analysed retrospectively with NONMEM to quantify the impact of patient parameters on gentamicin Vd and Cpeak.
