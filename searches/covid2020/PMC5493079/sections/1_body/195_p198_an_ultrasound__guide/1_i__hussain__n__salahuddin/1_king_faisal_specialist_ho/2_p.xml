 <bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective, observational study of patients with severe sepsis and acute oliguria (met the definition of AKI by reduced urine output of RIFLE criteria) was performed. Inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter, collapsibility, and renal perfusion with color Doppler were incorporated into an algorithm that was used by primary intensivists for volume assessment and management. The effects of the algorithm-directed interventions were assessed by serum creatinine and urine output (in ml/kg/hour) twenty-four hours later and by 28-day outcomes. The proposal was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (RAC no.2141039)
