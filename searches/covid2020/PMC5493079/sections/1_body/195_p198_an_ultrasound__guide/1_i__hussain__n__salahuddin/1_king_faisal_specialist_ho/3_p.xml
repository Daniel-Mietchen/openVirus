 <bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-three patients were studied; mean APACHE II score 21 ± 7.6,mean SOFA score 9 ± 3.8. Twenty-four (45 %) patients were diabetic, 23(43 %) hypertensive, 17(32 %) cirrhotic, 34(64 %) patients were on vasopressors. Mean creatinine at time of evaluation was 147 ± 75.4, serum lactate 3.2 (1,17).Ultrasound evaluation revealed intravascular dehydration in 18 (34 %), euvolumia in 23(43 %) and fluid repletion in 9 (17 %). Based on ultrasound results, 21(39 %) patients were given loop diuretics, 10(19 %) started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), fluid boluses to 21(39 %). In 1 (2 %) patient CRRT was stopped. Serum creatinine increased by 1.5 times in 5 (9 %) patients, urine output was 0.9 ml/kg/hour (IQR 1.6). 68 % patients recovered from AKI, with 6 (12 %) either on chronic dialysis or with chronic kidney disease. At follow-up, 32 % (17 patients) had renal injury.
