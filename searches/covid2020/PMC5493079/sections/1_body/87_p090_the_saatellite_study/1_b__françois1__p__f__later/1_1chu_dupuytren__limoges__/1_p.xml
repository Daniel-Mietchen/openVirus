 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, especially within the hospitalized or intensive care unit (ICU) population, is a clinically significant and serious disease that contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. MEDI4893 is a novel mAb that targets, binds, and functionally inhibits S aureus alpha toxin, a major determinant of S aureus virulence. The use of MEDI4893 to prevent S aureus pneumonia offers a novel paradigm for managing specific high-risk patients. We describe the rationale and design of the SATTELLITE study to investigate the use of MEDI4893 in mechanically-ventilated (MV) subjects.
