 <bold>Methods:</bold> SAATELLITE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of MEDI4893 in MV subjects. The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of NP caused by S aureus through 30 days postdose, proposed as a clinically meaningful, objective and reproduceable endpoint. Safety will be assessed through 360 days post-dose. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single intravenous infusion of Low-dose MEDI4893 or High-dose MEDI4893 or placebo and will be followed through 359 days post dose. Subjects enrolled are ICU patients aged [&gt;=] 18 yrs intubated and on mechanical ventilator, whose lower respiratory tract samples are positive for S aureus, but have not been diagnosed with new onset of pneumonia prior to randomization.
