<p id="Par3428">In 2012, the median [Interquartile range (IQR)] of LoMV hours was 92 [IQR: 77-101] while 2013 was 86 [IQR: 75-103] and 2014 was 107 [IQR: 80-121]. The median LoMV per patient for 2013 and 2014 were significantly higher than 2012 (p &lt; 0.05) (92 and 107 hours vs 86 hours). Median [IQR] for total sedative drug usage was 13 [IQR: 12-16] mg/hour LoMV in 2012, 15 [IQR: 13-18] in 2013 and 16 [IQR: 14-18] 2014. Usage in 2013 and 2014 were significantly higher than 2012 (p &lt; 0.05). The zero-lag cross-correlation between LoMV and sedation usage per month over the 3 years was 0.76 indicating that these rising trends are well mirrored, as additionally shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig92" ref-type="fig">92</xref>. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the trend of increasing sedation usage associated with increasing LoMV is robust, with 98 % of the simulation indicating an increasing trend.
