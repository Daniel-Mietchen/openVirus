<p id="Par3426">Data on sedative drug (Dexmedetomidine, Fentanyl and Propofol) usage and LoMV were collected from hospital records. Total sedative drug use and LoMV were assessed monthly and compared between years using a Wilcoxon Ranksum and Kruskal-Wallis test. Zero-lag cross correlations were used to assess the relationship between month-to-month trends in LoMV and sedation use. A Monte-Carlo simulation was performed to assess the impact of potential outlier months on the results (4 of 36Â months were removed without replacement and the analysis repeated 10,000 times). Standardised Mortality Rate (SMR) was calculated each year to account for changes in cohort.</p>
