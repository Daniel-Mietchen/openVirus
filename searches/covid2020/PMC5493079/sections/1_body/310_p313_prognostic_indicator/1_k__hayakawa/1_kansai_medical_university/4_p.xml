<p id="Par2816">All consecutive patients who were suffering from OHCA and who were then transported to institutions participating in this registry were prospectively recorded in July 2012 to December 2013. Criteria for inclusion of this study were a witnessed cardiac arrest, age greater than 17 years, presumed cardiac origin of the arrest, and successful ROSC. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR) analysis was used to develop the best prediction model. The dependent variables were favorable outcome (cerebral-performance category: CPC 1-2) and poor outcome (CPC 3-5) at 1 month after the event. The explanatory variables were used concerning patient characteristics and resuscitation.</p>
