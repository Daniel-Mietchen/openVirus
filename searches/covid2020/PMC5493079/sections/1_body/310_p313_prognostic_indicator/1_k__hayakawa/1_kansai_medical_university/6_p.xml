<p id="Par2818">Subjects comprised 147 patients in VF and 177 patients with pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole. The percentage of favorable outcomes was 42.2 % (62/147) in VF and 11.3 % (20/177) in PEA/asystole. The most important prognostic indicators of favorable outcome founded by MLR were age (p &lt; 0.01), time from collapse to ROSC (TROSC) (p &lt; 0.01), base deficit (p = 0.06), presence of by-stander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (p = 0.09) for VF and age (p = 0.05), TROSC (p &lt; 0.01), and base deficit (p &lt; 0.05) for PEA/asystole. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were 0.866 for VF and 0.896 for PEA/asystole respectively.</p>
