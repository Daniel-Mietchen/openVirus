<p id="Par2659">Single-center prospective observational study. All patients admitted to 2 ICUs between January and April of 2014 for more than five days, were enrolled. Data on demographics and clinical characteristics of patients were collected at baseline. All blood glucose measurements during the first 5 days were recorded. Three insulin protocols were used, two using subcutaneous actrapid insulin depending if the patient is diabetic (DP) or not (NDP), and an intensive protocol (IP) using IV insulin depending solely on the glycemic value using a target value of 180 mg/dL. A glucose value of 70 mg/dL or less was considered moderate hypoglycemia and 40 mg/dL or less as severe hypoglycemia. SPSS was used for statistical analysis.</p>
