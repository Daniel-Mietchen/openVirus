<p id="Par2661">106 patients were included, 66 (66,26 %) were men, with an average age of 62,53 ± 15,61 years, mortality rate was 20,75 %. 50 (47,17 %) patients were non-surgical. 34 were diabetic (32,08 %). On average 6.1 glucose measurements were performed per patient/day. The average value of blood glucose levels over the first five days was 168,18 +/- 46,93 mg/dL (diabetic - 182,65 +/- 46,91 mg/dL; nondiabetic - 161,18 +/- 46,93 mg/dL). Depending on protocol the average value of blood glucose was 190,76 +/- 52,20 mg/deal for DP, 158,12 +/- 39,65 mg/dl for the NDP and 175,12 +/- 47,03 mg/dl (IP). The glycemic variability was 103,45 +/- 71,06 mg/dl for DP, 64,41 +/- 55,14 mg/dl for NDP and 113,50 +/- 67,76 mg/dl for IP. 17 patients (16,04 %) had at least 1 episode of moderate hypoglycemia and 7 patients (6,6 %) had severe hypoglycemia. In diabetic patients 19/886 (2,14 %) determinations were under 70 mg/dL and 4/886 (0,45 %) were under 40 mg/dL, as for non-diabetic 15/1720 (0,87 %) were under 70 mg/dL and 5/1720 (0,29 %) were under 40 mg/dL. Depending on insulin protocol, the incidence of moderate hypoglycemia was 2,88 % in DP, 0,98 % in NDP and 0,96 % in IP; and in severe hypoglycemia was 0,89 % in DP, 0,25 % in NDP and 0,21 % in IP.</p>
