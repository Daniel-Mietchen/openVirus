<p id="Par2669">1)Mortality of the patients with SOFAmax of 0-3(n = 60), 4(n = 26), 5(n = 21), 6(n = 13), 7-8(n = 12), 9-10(n = 8), 11-19(n = 9) was 0 %, 8 %, 14 %, 23 %, 25 %, 50 % and 78 %, respectively. 2)BGsd was linearly correlated to BGm(correlation coefficient r = 0.79). 3)SOFAmax was two-dimensionally correlated to both BGm and BGsd. Range of BGm and BGsd with SOFAmax less than 4, calculated from the two-dimensional, or quadratic, equation, was 121-178 and 24-44 mg/dL, respectively. 4)Two-dimensional correlation coefficient(R) between SOFAmax and BGm according to SOFAmax above 0(n = 149), 2(n = 121), 4(n = 89), 6(n = 42), 8(n = 21) and 10(n = 11) was 0.38, 0.41, 0.37, 0.49, 0.66 and 0.54, respectively. 5)R between SOFAmax and BGsd according to SOFAmax above 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 was 0.43, 0.46, 0.45, 0.54, 0.62 and 0.70, respectively.</p>
