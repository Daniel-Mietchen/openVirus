<p id="Par2671">1)BG control to hyperglycemia is one of the measures which bring the reduction of BG variability. 2)BG targets were considered to be obtained by the analysis of two-dimensional relationship between severity of the diseases and BG. 3)There is a possibility that strict BG control is more effective to severer(moderate to severe) patients, considering the results indicating higher correlation coefficient (R) in severer patients. 4)Glucose administration for increasing BG and BG variability might bring beneficial effect not only for hypoglycemic patients but also for a part of normoglycemic patients, judging from BG targets listed above. 5)Low BG variability in a part of severe patients may be related to lower variability of physiologic activity. 6)Analysis of the relationship between severity of the diseases and BG based on the fine BG control, including by the use of artificial pancreas, was considered to link to better BG control and outcomes.</p>
