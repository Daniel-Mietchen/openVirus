 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Passive exhalation shows a characteristic exponential course with asymptotic approximation of the end expiratory lung volume. It can be described as V(t) = Vinsp · e^(-t/(R · C)) where V is the lung volume at time t, Vinsp the volume at end inspiration, R the resistance and C the compliance of the lungs. The product of R · C is called τ (tau). Although R and C can vary considerably between different lung regions, traditional pulmonary function tests provide global values, only. Therefore, we recently proposed a novel method to obtain regional τ values using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). As this approach can be challenging in presence of small ventilation amplitudes, noisy signals and heterogeneity we determined in this study its robustness.
