 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The suggested approach for calculating regional expiratory τ values provided robust results with low coefficients of variation. However, certain lung regions at the lungs’ boundary showed high variability. Therefore, to increase reliability such pixels should be excluded from future calculations.
