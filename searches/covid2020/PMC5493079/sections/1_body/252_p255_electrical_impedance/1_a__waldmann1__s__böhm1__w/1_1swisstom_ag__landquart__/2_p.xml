 <bold>Methods:</bold> In 8 intubated patients, with hypoxemic or hypercapnic respiratory failure, we measured EIT signals at 50 images per second using Swisstom BB
 <sup>2</sup> recording 30 consecutive breaths during steady state conditions. Regional breath by breath τ values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig69" ref-type="fig">69</xref>) were estimated by fitting an exponential model to each regional curve. Only τ values within the range of 0.05 and 3 s stemming from appropriately fitted curves (R
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.6) were considered thereby excluding poorly ventilated and poorly fitted lung areas. To estimate the robustness of τ , we calculated the regional coefficient of variation (CV) for all breaths as standard deviation divided by mean.
