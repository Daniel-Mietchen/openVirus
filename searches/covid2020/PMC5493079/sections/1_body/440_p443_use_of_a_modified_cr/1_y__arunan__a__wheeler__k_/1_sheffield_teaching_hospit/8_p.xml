 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Absolute CriSTAL score values, as assessed with our simplified tool, were low across all groups. The signal for increased mortality with higher scores may suggest use in informing treatment stratifications in elderly critically ill patients. Identification of the most appropriate individual parameters and their relative contributions towards an overall score merits further evaluation.
