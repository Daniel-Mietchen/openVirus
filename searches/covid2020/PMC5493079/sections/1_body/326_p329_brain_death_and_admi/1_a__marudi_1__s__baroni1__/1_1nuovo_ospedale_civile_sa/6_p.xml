The mean age was 68.8 ± 14.9 standard deviation (SD) with a progressive increase during the period observed from 60.3 ± 14.4 (2009) to 69.1 ± 14.4 (2015) in the BD group (p &lt; 0.05). Males were 236 (50.8 %). The mean GCS at admission was 4.4 ± 2.5. Among all patients, 245(52.7 %) have met criteria for brain death according with Italian law. Admission diagnoses were cerebral haemorrhage for 241 patients (51.8 %), anoxic coma for 91(19.6 %), brain trauma for 71(15.3 %), ischemic stroke for 46 (9.9 %), brain cancers for 9 (1.9 %) and other reasons for 7 (1.5 %). 155 (63,3 %) patients with brain haemorrhage developed brain death (p &lt; 0.01) (Fig.
