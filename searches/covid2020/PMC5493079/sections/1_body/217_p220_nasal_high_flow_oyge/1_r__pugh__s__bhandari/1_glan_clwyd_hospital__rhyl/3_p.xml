 <bold>Results:</bold> We identified 468 potentially relevant studies. 4 RCTs met inclusion criteria. There were important differences in patient groups, interventions and outcome measurements, precluding meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in intubation rate or mortality between intervention groups, with the exception of Frat (2015), who demonstrated significantly reduced 90d mortality in NHFO compared with standard O2 and NIV groups, and lower intubation rate on post hoc analysis of patients with lowest PF ratio.
