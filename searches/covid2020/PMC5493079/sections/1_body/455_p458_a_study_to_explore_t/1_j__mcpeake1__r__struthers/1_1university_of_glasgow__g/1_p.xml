 <bold>Introduction:</bold> ICU survivors suffer persistent physical, psychological and social problems in the months and years after discharge from critical care (1). Caregivers of these patients also suffer similar problems (2). As a result, an innovative, peer supported rehabilitation programme- Intensive Care Syndrome: Promoting Independence and Return to Employment (InS:PIRE) was created in Glasgow Royal Infirmary. This 5 week multi disciplinary programme, which is co facilitated by patient and family volunteers further along the recovery trajectory, aims to empower patients and caregivers to take control of their health and wellbeing. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of the volunteers who participated in InS:PIRE. It also sought to identify the support required by volunteers from healthcare professionals involved in the project.
