<p id="Par3162">In the period of the study, 1789 patients were admitted to the ICU and 13 PGWH patients were included. There were 10 male patients (77 %) and 3 female (23 %), with a mean age of 30 years (range 14-64). There were no self-inflicted lesions (all PGWH were results of aggression). Glasgow Coma Scale at admission was 8 or less in 10 patients. On admission, 7 patients were anisocoric, 8 presenting shock, 5 had associated body lesions from another gunshot wound (such as limbs or in the thorax). Mean SAPS 3 was 67 (range 35-94) and mean Apache II, 26 (range 8-37). The CT scan findings were: midline shift in 8 patients, 7 single lobe haemorrhages (such as frontal or parietal lobe), and 6 patients with bleeding in more than one lobe. Six patients had subarachnoid and 3 had intraventricular hemorrhage. Early surgical procedure was made to 10 patients (mainly decompressive craniectomy). The mean hospital length of stay was 21 days (range 2 to 136 days). Six patients had wound infection, and three, infection in other sites. The mortality rate for the entire group was 54 % (7 out 13). 4 patients progressed to brain death. Of the six patients discharged from the hospital, four had good outcome (defined as modified Rankin scores of 0-3), and two, bad outcome (modified Rankin of 4).</p>
