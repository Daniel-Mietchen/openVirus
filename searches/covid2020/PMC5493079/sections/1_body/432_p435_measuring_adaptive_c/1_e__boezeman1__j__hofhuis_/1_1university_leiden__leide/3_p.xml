 <bold>Results:</bold> Study 1 showed that the SICQ has adequate internal consistency (0.64 [&lt;=] α [&lt;=] 0.79), a clear initial factor structure, and adequate convergent (0.24 [&lt;=] r [&lt;=] 0.50) and divergent (r [&lt;=] 0.12) construct validity. Study 2 showed that the SICQ has good structural validity, and moderate (r = 0.37; non-acceptance) to strong (r &gt; 0.50; fighting spirit, toughness, redefinition, and positivism) patient-close proxy agreement.
