 <bold>Methods:</bold> Study 1 (n = 103 hospitalized patients) addressed the internal consistency, initial factor structure, and construct validity, of the SICQ. Coping subscales of the BRIEF COPE, Illness Cognition Questionnaire, and Utrecht Coping List, were used as comparator measures in testing the construct validity of the SICQ-subscales (fighting spirit, toughness, redefinition, positivism, non-acceptance). Study 2 (n = 100 ICU-patients and close family members of ICU-patients as proxies) addressed the structural validity of the SICQ with confirmatory factor analyses, and examined patient-close proxy agreement with correlation and Bland-Altman Plot analyses.
