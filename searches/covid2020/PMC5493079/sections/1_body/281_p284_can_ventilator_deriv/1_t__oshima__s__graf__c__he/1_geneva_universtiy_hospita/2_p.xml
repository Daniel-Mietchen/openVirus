 <bold>Methods:</bold> 261 unselected mechanically ventilated patients with EE measured by indirect calorimetry were analyzed. EE was compared with calculated EEVCO2 using measured VCO2 and RQfixed = 0.85. The clinically acceptable accuracy level for EEVCO2 was set at ±5 %. Equations for the calculation of EE and EEVCO2 are shown on Table 
 <xref rid="Tab37" ref-type="table">37</xref>. Since 5 % variation of EEVCO2 corresponded to ±0.05 of RQfixed, we compared the EEVCO2 and EE among patients with measured RQ lower, matching, or higher than this range. Statistical analysis was conducted by paired t-test of EEVCO2 and EE, and bias was determined from the mean difference (kcal/d). Actual 5 % accuracy rates of EEVCO2 for each group were also calculated. All analyses were conducted on SPSS statistics version 22 (IBM, USA).
