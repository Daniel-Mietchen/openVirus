 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Energy expenditure calculated from ventilator derived measurements is acceptable for only 40Â % of the patient population, and large bias can be overlooked if results are not verified by indirect calorimetry. EE derived from ventilator measurements should not be considered equal to EE measured by indirect calorimetry.
