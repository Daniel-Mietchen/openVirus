<p id="Par1799">Patients surviving to day-28 had a lower Pv-aCO2 gap at time 0 (7.5, IQR 7 vs. 4.8, IQR 5, p = 0.007), and demonstrated greater clearance of the Pv-aCO2 gap during resuscitation (-0.75 IQR 4.8 vs. +0.75 IQR 5.2, p =0.024). A cut-off value of ¡Ý 6 mmHg significantly predicted 28 day mortality (75 % vs. 45.5 %, p =0.033). In a subgroup of patients in whom a resuscitative target of ScvO2 70 % was achieved, a higher Pv-aCO2 gap was significantly associated with lower 28-day survival (6.7 IQR 6 vs. 3.7 IQR 4, p =0.009).</p>
