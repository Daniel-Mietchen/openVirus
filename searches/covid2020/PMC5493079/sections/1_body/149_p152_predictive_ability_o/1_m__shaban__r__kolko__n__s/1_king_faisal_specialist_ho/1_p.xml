 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide difference (Pv-aCO2 or CO2 gap) is recognized as an index of global tissue perfusion. Additionally, the ratio of Pv-aCO2 by arterial-to-central venous O2 content difference (Ca-vO2), has been described as indicative of ¡®anerobiosis¡¯ in shock. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the predictive abilities of the Pv-aCO2 gap and Pv-aCO2/Ca-vO2 ratio in patients undergoing resuscitation from shock.
