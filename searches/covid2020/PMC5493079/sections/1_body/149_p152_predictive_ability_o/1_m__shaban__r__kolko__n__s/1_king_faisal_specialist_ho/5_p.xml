<p id="Par1800">Pv-aCO2/Ca-vO2 ratios were significantly lower in patients surviving the ICU and until day-28 of follow up; this relationship was observed both at time 0 (0.21,IQR 0.17 vs. 0.27, IQR 0.22, p =0.042) and at time 3 (0.19, IQR 0.1 vs. 0.24,IQR 0.07, p =0.047) for ICU mortality, and (0.27, IQR 0.19 vs. 0.18,IQR 0.12, p =0.013) and (0.27, IQR 0.08 vs. 0.19, IQR 0.10,p = 0.011) for 28-day survival.</p>
