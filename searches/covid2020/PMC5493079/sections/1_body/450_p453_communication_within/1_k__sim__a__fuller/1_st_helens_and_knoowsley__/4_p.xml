 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The communication between patients and doctors within the CCU calls for vast improvement. Given the evidence as mentioned, it is imperative that strategies are put in place to help improve the results which were found. This would include a simple adjunct next to the bedside to help remind the Consultant about the importance of effective communication. It is worthwhile re-auditing once this implementation has been put in place to see whether communication has improved.
