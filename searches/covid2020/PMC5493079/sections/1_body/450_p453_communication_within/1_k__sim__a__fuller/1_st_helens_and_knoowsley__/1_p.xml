 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The ability to communicate well with patients and their relatives is a fundamental clinical skill in intensive care medicine and central to good medical practice. Communication at the bedside, even when the patient is unconscious or sedated, may often be recalled by critical care survivors and can impact upon long-term psychological outcomes[1].The Intensive Care Society released guidelines for the provision of intensive care services and one area which was highlighted was the patient and relative perspective, the importance of effective communication with relatives and patients and valuable time spent talking to the patient[2].The aim of this audit was to assess the communication skills on the daily ward rounds between the team leader, normally the on call Consultant, and the patient at the bedside.
