<p id="Par2884">Baseline data indicated no consistent TTM strategy with documented TT ranging from 35 to 37 °C, with no target documented in 50 %. Only 28 % were actively cooled, while 50 % were pyrexial (defined as &gt;37.5 °C) and all but one patient (94 %) exceeded the TTM target of 36 °C by at least 0.5 °C. Prior to intervention, the average time spent above 37.5 °C was 5.8 hours and the average time above 36.5 °C was 11.8 hours.</p>
