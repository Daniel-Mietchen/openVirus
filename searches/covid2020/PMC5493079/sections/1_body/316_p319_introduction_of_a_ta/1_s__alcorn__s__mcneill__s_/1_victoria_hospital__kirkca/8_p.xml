<p id="Par2885">Following the intervention, TTs ranged from 36-36.5 °C with an increased proportion of patients (12, 63 %) having the desired TT of 36 °C. A decreased proportion, 26 % regrettably still had no documented TT, however significantly more patients (13, 68 %) were actively cooled. Only 4 patients (21 %) were pyrexial, while 12 still exceeded 36.5 °C (63 %). Encouragingly, after the introduction of the protocol, the average time spent above 37.5 °C was 1.15 hours (80 % reduction) and the average time above 36.5 °C was 4.2 hours (64 % reduction).</p>
