<p id="Par2879">We report the experience of a 10-bed intensive care unit (ICU) introducing a targeted temperature management (TTM) strategy following cardiac arrest based on the TTM trial investigation protocol [1], including pre- and post-intervention data. Our unit averages 4 cardiac arrest cases a month; at this low frequency, and given recent updates to TTM evidence, we were concerned that our temperature management practice could be inconsistent or outdated.</p>
