 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Demand for Critical Care (CC) is increasing but admission may be inappropriate if the patient is unlikely to survive. Consequently, published guidance may no longer reflect current practice [1-2]. Clinical frailty evaluation scores have recently been shown to be associated with increased mortality in patients already admitted to CC [3]. We aimed to establish the impact of frailty and other factors on the decision whether to admit a deteriorating hospital patient to CC.
