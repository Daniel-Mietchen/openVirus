 <bold>Results:</bold> Between June and October 2015 data was collected on 220 patients referred to CC, of whom 87 (39.5%) were admitted. Median age was 66.5 (50-77) years, 134 (60.9%) were male and the median LOS prior to referral was 2 (0-7) days. The median SOFA score, CCFS and Charlson age-adjusted comorbidity index (CACI) was 5 (4-7), 4 (3-5) and 4 (2-6), respectively. At unadjusted logistic regression analysis age (p = 0.86), gender (p = 0.72), LOS (p = 0.34) and SOFA score (p = 0.42) did not impact on likelihood of admission to CC. Conversely, each unit increase in the CACI (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.91, p = 0.002) and in the CCFS (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.85, p &lt; 0.001) caused a decrease of approximately 22% and 31% in the odds of admission, respectively. On age and gender adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis CCFS retained its ability to predict admission to critical care (OR 0.65 per unit increase, 95% CI 0.49-0.85, p = 0.002), whilst CACI did not (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70-1.03, p = 0.09).
