 <bold>Introduction:</bold> A hallmark of sepsis is early onset microvascular dysfunction. However, the mechanism responsible for maldistribution of capillary blood flow is not understood. Evidence suggests red blood cells (RBC) can sense local oxygen (O2) conditions and signal the vasculature, via adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to increase capillary flow. We hypothesized that sepsis impaired microvascular autoregulation over the entire capillary network, within a capillary and within the RBC. Study objectives were to: 1) measure capillary response time within hypoxic capillaries (capillaries with RBC hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SO2) &lt; 20 %), 2) test the null hypothesis that sepsis had no effect on RBC O2-dependent ATP efflux and 3) develop a pathophysiological model.
