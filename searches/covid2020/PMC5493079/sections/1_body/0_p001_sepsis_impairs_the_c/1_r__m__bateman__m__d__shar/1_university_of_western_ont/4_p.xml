 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Sepsis impaired microvascular autoregulation at the capillary and erythrocyte level. Impaired autoregulation was manifested by increased capillary stopped-flow, increased capillary response time within hypoxic capillaries, decreased capillary oxygen supply rate and decreased RBC O2-dependent ATP efflux. This loss of local microvascular control was partially off-set by increased capillary RBC supply rate, which correlated with increased plasma NOx.
