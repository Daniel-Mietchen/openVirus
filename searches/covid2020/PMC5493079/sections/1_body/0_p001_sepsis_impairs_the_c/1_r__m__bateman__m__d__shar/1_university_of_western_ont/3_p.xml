 <bold>Results:</bold> Compared to control, sepsis increased capillary stopped flow and plasma lactate (p &lt; 0.05). Increased plasma NOx (p &lt; 0.001) was related to increased capillary RBC SR (p = 0.027). Analysis of 30-second capillary SR-SO2-qO2 profiles, revealed a shift towards decreased (p &lt; 0.05) oxygen supply rates in some capillaries. Moreover, capillary response time within hypoxic capillaries (time to restore capillary RBC SO2 &gt; 20 %) increased 3-4 fold (p &lt; 0.05). And, consistent with impaired microvascular autoregulation, the RBC’s response to a hypoxic environment, measured as RBC O2-dependent ATP efflux, decreased by 62.5 % (p &lt; 0.001).
