 <bold>Methods:</bold> Hypotensive sepsis was studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats using cecal ligation and perforation, with a 6-hour end point. Rat hindlimb skeletal muscle microcirculation was imaged using a dual wavelength spectrophotometric intravital microscopy system, and capillary RBC supply rate (SR = RBC/s), RBC SO2 and oxygen supply rate (qO2 = pLO2/s) were quantified. Arterial NOx (nitrite + nitrate) and RBC O2-dependent ATP efflux were measured using a nitric oxide (NO) analyzer and gas exchanger, respectively.
