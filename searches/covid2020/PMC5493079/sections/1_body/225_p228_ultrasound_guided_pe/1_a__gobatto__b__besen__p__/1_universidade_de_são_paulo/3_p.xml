 <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 4965 patients were screened, of whom 118 underwent the procedure, 60 patients in the ultrasound group and 58 patients in the bronchoscopy group. Procedure failure occurred in one (1.67 %) patient in the ultrasound group and one (1.72 %) patient in the bronchoscopy group, with an absolute risk difference of 0.06 % between groups (90 % confidence interval, -5.57 to 5.85) in favor of the ultrasound group in the as treated analysis, not including the prespecified margin of 6 % for noninferiority. No other patient had any major complication in both groups. Procedure-related minor complications occurred in 20 (33.3 %) patients in the ultrasound group and 12 (20.7 %) patients in the bronchoscopy group, (P = 0.122). The median procedure length was 11 [7-19] vs. 13 [8-20] minutes (P = 0.468), respectively and clinical outcomes were also not different between groups.
