 <bold>Methods:</bold> An open-label, parallel, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing ultrasound-guided PDT with bronchoscopy-guided PDT in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients indicated for a tracheostomy. The primary outcome was procedure failure defined as a composite end-point of conversion to surgical tracheostomy; associated use of bronchoscopy in the case of ultrasound-guided PDT; associated use of ultrasound in case of bronchoscopy-guided PDT; or occurrence of a major complication.
