 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT) is routinely performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) with bronchoscopy guidance. Recently, ultrasound has emerged as a potentially useful tool to assist PDT as it helps to identify the most appropriate location for the tracheal puncture site, guide needle insertion into the trachea, and may significantly reduce procedure-related complications.
