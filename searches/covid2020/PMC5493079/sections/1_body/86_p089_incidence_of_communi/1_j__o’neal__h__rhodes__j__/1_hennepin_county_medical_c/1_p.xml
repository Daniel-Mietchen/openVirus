 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines acknowledge respiratory viruses as a cause for CAP, but provide few recommendations regarding diagnosis or treatment due to lack of data [1]. New technology to detect viral pathogens by highly sensitive nucleic amplification tests has allowed for identification of additional viruses through a small sample of respiratory secretions [2]. Our aim is to describe the incidence of viruses in mechanically ventilated patients with CAP in the ICU.
