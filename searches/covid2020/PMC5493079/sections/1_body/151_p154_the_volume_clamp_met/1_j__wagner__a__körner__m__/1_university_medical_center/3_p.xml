<p id="Par1809">Three pairs of measurements were excluded due to artifacts resulting in 87 paired measurements for analysis. In addition, 25 cardiac output–modifying maneuvers were analyzed to evaluate trending ability. We conducted 2 separate comparative analyses: 1) CNCO calibrated to the first simultaneously measured PAC-CO value (CNCOcal) vs. PAC-CO and 2) CNCO auto-calibrated to biometric patient data (CNCObio) vs. PAC-CO. Agreement between the two methods was statistically assessed by Bland-Altman analysis and by calculating the percentage error (PE). For evaluating trending ability, the concordance rate (CCR) was calculated. An exclusion zone of 0.5 L/min was applied.</p>
