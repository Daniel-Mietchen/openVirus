 <bold>Introductions:</bold> The CNAP technology (CNSystems Medizintechnik AG, Graz, Austria) enables noninvasive continuous recording of the arterial pressure waveform based on the volume clamp method. Recently, the manufacturer released a novel algorithm for measuring cardiac output (CO) using pulse contour analysis of the arterial waveform. In this study, we compared CO measurements with CNAP (CNCO) with invasive CO measurements using intermittent pulmonary artery thermodilution (pulmonary artery catheter (PAC); PAC-CO) in postoperative cardiothoracic surgery patients.
