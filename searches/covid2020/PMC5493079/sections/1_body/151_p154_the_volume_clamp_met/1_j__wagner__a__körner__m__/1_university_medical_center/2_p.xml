 <bold>Methods:</bold> In this interim analysis, simultaneously obtained CNCO and PAC-CO measurements were analyzed in 30 patients during the first hours after cardiothoracic surgery. We performed 3 independent sets of 5 consecutive thermodilution measurements each per patient. The average of the 3 closest of the 5 PAC-CO measurements was used for comparison with the average of the corresponding CNCO values.
