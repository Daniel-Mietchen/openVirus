<p id="Par2265">Using NIV previously at home (p = 0,025), APACHE II (p = 0,001), SOFA (P = 0,012) were detected as factors affecting the NIV success in univariate analysis. While fragile patients(CFS &gt; =5) had significantly higher application problems(80 % vs 57 % p:0,038), entubation (31 % vs 8 %, p:0,007) and mortality rates (30 % vs 4 %, p:0,001), significantly lower NIV succes rates (61 % vs 85 %, p: 0,011). In logistic regression analyses fragility was only independent risk factor for NIV failure (OR:3.5, p:0,02).</p>
