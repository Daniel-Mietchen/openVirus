 <bold>Methods:</bold> We included in the patients over 50 years old who were admitted to Medical ICUs of our hospital. For detection of patients fragility Clinical Fragility Score (CFS) and comprehensive geriatric assesment were used. Patients who have CFS &gt; =5 were considered as fragile. The successful NIV group (NSG) is defined as achieving success in at least two of the followings: PaO2 &gt; 60 mmHg, PaCO2 &lt; 50 mmHg, pH = 7,35-7,45, improvement of respiratory effort, recovery of consciousness. The relationship between entubation and fragility was also assessed. Application problems were defined as; cooperation problems, hearing problems, delirium/agitation (Richmond agitation sedation scale &gt; 1) , claustrophobia, alzheimer, problems related with chin, mouth tooth and leak (&gt;35 L/min).
