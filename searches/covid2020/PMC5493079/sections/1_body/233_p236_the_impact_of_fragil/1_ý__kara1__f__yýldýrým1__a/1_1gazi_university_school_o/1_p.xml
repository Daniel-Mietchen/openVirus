 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Many factors affecting noninvasive ventilation (NIV) success had been investigated up to now but there is no any data about the affect of fragility on NIV outcomes in critically ill patients. In this prospective and observational study, we aimed to investigate the effect of fragility on the application and results of NIV in the intensive care unit (ICU).
