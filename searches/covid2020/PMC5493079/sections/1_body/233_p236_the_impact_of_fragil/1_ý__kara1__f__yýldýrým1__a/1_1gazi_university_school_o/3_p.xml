 <bold>Results:</bold> We included in 85 patients who were underwent to NIV in two ICUs. Mean age of patients was 72,5 ± 10,6, 60 % of them were male and mean APACHE II score was 20,6 ± 5,7 (8-34). Mean CFS of the patients was 4,6 ± 1,6 and 42 % of them were fragile (CFS &gt; =5). There were 63 (75 %) patients in NSG and 22 (25 %) in NIV failure group (NFG). APACHE II and SOFA scores of NFG were higher and NSG had more non-fragile patients (CFS &lt; 5) (41 vs 22, p = 0.011). Fifty-three (62,4 %) patients had NIV application problems and mean CFS of this group was higher (4,9 ± 1,6 vs 4,0 ± 1,7, p = 0,028).
