 <bold>Methods:</bold> 14 Sprague-Dawley rats (400-600 g) were anaesthetised with ketamine, xylazine and butorphanol, then intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. A femoral and jugular vein were cannulated to provide dialysis access. Ventilation rate was adjusted to create hypercapnia and dialysis commenced. Dialysis was provided using a M10 filter (Baxter, France), and the dialysate was constructed such that no bicarbonate is present, but SID was maintained. Blood gases were tested hourly (iStat, Abbott). Control dialysis experiments were performed with Primal™ (Baxter, France). Data is reported as mean and standard deviation and differences compared using Students t-test.
