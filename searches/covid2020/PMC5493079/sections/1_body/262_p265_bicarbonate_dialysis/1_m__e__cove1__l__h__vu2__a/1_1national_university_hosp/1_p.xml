 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Low tidal volume ventilation improves outcomes in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, but may impair carbon dioxide (CO[sub]2[/sub]) clearance. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO[sub]2[/sub]R) can control CO[sub]2[/sub], but existing devices are expensive and require considerable expertise to operate. Since CO[sub]2[/sub] is transported predominantly as bicarbonate, using dialysis to remove bicarbonate offers several advantages, but this approach has been limited by bicarbonate replacement problems. However, contemporary understanding of acid-base balance treats bicarbonate as an anion whose concentration is dependent on the strong ion difference (SID). We hypothesised that a novel dialysate designed to remove bicarbonate, but maintain SID, would lower CO[sub]2[/sub] with no change in pH. We tested this hypothesis in a rodent dialysis model, comparing our dialysate to a conventional solution (Prismasolâ„¢).
