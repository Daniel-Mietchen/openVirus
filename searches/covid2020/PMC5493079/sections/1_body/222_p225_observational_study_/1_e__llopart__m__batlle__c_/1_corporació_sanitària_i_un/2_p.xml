 <bold>Methods:</bold> Prospective observational study in a general mixed ICU (May-December 2014). Daily screening of patients considered ready to wean by their medical team was performed. Only those patients who succeeded a spontaneous breathing trial and were eligible for extubation, according to the local protocol, were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. We recorded the CL value (%) at the end of the successful spontaneous breathing trial, prior to extubation. The appearance of UAO, the need for reintubation, and reinstitution of MV were recorded.
