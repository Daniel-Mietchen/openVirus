 <bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-three patients were studied. The mean age was 65 ± 12 years old, 64 % were males, 10 patients (30 %) were receiving corticosteroids, and the total duration of MV at inclusion was 13 ± 7 days. After extubation, four patients (12 %) developed UAO, requiring reintubation in two cases. The CL test values were significantly lower in those patients who developed UAO (35 ± 22 % vs 61 ± 25 %; p = 0.05). The ROC curve analysis of the value of CL test in predicting UAO showed an AUC of 0.8 (95 % CI 0.61 to 0.98; p = 0.06). Other factors associated with the appearance of UAO were a difficult intubation (75 % vs 8 %, p = 0.001.), number of attempts in the initial intubation (2 vs 1, p = 0.001), and prehospital intubation (50 % vs 3 %, p &lt;0.01). No differences in Cormack, MV days or diameter of the endotracheal tube were found. None of the patients receiving corticosteroids prior to extubation developed UAO, whereas among the remaining 23 patients, 4 (17 %) developed UAO (p =0.1).
