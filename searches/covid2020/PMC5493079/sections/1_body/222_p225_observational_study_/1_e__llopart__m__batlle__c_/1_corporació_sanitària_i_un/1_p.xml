 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The cuff-leak (CL) test has been postulated as a useful tool in order to assess the risk of upper airway obstruction (UAO) after extubation. However, current evidence is still limited, and systematic exclusion of patients receiving corticosteroids in prospective trials further limits our knowledge. Our objective was to evaluate the association of the value of the CL test and the appearance of UAO, including patients receiving corticosteroids, and to detect other associated risk factors.
