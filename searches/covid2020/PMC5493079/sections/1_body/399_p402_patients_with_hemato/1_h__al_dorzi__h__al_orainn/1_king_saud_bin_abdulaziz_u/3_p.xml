 <bold>Results:</bold> In the 6-year period, 190 patients with hematological malignancies were admitted to the ICU and 123 (64.7 %) required intubation for acute respiratory failure. These patients had mean age = 56.9 ± 19.6 years and APACHE II score = 27.9 ± 7.9 and were predominantly males (63.4 %). Lymphomas (43.9 %) were the most common hematologic malignancy followed by acute leukemias (39.0 %). Only 4 patients had bone marrow transplantation. Septic shock was present in most (62.6 %) patients on ICU admission. Noninvasive ventilation was tried in 23 (18.7 %) but failed. Chemotherapy was provided in 19 (15.4 %) patients during ICU stay. New renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury was used in 18 (14.6 %) patients. Hospital mortality was 69.1 % (64.6 % for acute leukemias and 70.4 % for lymphomas, p = 0.68). Most deaths (82.4 %) occurred in the ICU. On multivariate analysis, male gender (odds ratio, 4.81; 95 % confidence interval, 1.69-13.72), septic shock (odds ratio, 5.67; 95 % confidence interval, 1.92-16.75) and new renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 13.59; 95 % confidence interval, 1.14-161.93) were independent mortality predictors. Neither noninvasive ventilation failure nor chemotherapy during ICU stay was associated with mortality.
