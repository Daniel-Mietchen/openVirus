 <bold>Methods:</bold> This was a retrospective study of all patients with hematological malignancies who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh from 01/01/2008 to 31/12/2013 and required intubation. We noted their baseline clinical characteristics, treatments received in the ICU and different outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate predictors of hospital mortality. Variables entered in the model were gender, APACHE II score, PO2:FiO2 on admission, admission serum lactate and INR, septic shock, noninvasive ventilation before intubation, renal replacement therapy and chemotherapy administration in the ICU.
