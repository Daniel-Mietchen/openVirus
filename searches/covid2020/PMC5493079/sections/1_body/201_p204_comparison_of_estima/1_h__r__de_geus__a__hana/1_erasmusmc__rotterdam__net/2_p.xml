 <bold>Methods:</bold> In order to calculate GFR applying MDRD, CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine and CKD-EPI-Cystatin-C formulae and assess their mutual comparability in an all-comer adult academic ICU cohort we performed a post-hoc analysis from the NGAL-study. MDRD-eGFR, CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine-eGFR and CKD-EPI-Cystatin-C-eGFR were calculated using admission-day data. Man-Whitney U test was used for comparison between groups.
