 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The serum-creatinine based estimation of Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the MDRD-equation is inaccurate in critically ill patients and tends to severely overestimate the “real time clearance capacity” especially in catabolic states. Recently, CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine and CKD-EPI-Cystatin-C equations were introduced as more precise alternatives for eGFR. Originally, all these equations have been validated in patients with stable chronic kidney disease. Most Dutch hospital laboratories, ours included, still report MDRD-eGFR in their electronic patient data system, however many intend to, or already have switched to CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine-eGFR. To date, (e)GFR is a key element in clinical decision making, even in the ICU setting. However, indiscriminate application of these mathematical equations may be questionable in the critically ill.
