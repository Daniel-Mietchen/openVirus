 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In our cohort the use of the abovementioned mathematical equations results in completely different eGFR values. Particularly, the new CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine and CKD-EPI-Cystatin-C equations provide incomparable eGFR values. Although these formulae are supposed to be more precise, it remains questionable whether they are sufficiently reliable in the ICU-setting.
