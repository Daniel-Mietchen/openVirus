 <bold>Results:</bold> Out of 663 consecutive admissions, 47 cases were excluded due to missing data. Patient characteristics comprise median (95 % CI) age of 59 years (57-60), SOFA score 5 (5-5), APACHE II score 18 (17-19), male:female ratio 358:257. Analysis of eGFR by MDRD-, CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine en CKD-EPI-Cystatin-C resulted in significantly different outcomes. In comparison to the MDRD-equation, CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine-eGFR values are higher (P[&lt;=]0.05), whereas CKD-EPI-Cystatin-C values are lower (P[&lt;=]0.002). In direct comparison the CKD-EPI-Serum-Creatinine-eGFR is higher than the CKD-EPI-Cystatin-C-eGFR. This difference is significant for the entire cohort and persists throughout KDIGO stages 1-4 subgroups (p[&lt;=]0.003). In KDIGO stage 5 small sample size limits interpretation of results.
