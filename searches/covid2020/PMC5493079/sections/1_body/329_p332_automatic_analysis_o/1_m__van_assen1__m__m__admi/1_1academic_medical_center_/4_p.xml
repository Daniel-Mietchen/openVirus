<p id="Par3004">Prospective cohort study in comatose ICU patients with continuous EEG background patterns in two Dutch ICUs. Reactivity to auditory, visual and sensory stimuli was tested following a strict protocol. Visual analysis was regarded as the gold standard. Reactivity was defined as a change in amplitude or frequency in the EEG after stimulation, excluding muscle activity. Stimulus responses were scored by three independent experts (JH, MvP, MT-C), responses on which all three experts agreed were used. Data was separated in an independent training and validation set. Spectral characteristics of the EEG before and after each stimulus were compared. These were determined by both parametric and non-parametric methods. Epochs of 2, 5 and 10Â seconds before and after the start of the stimulus were analyzed and averaged over 1, 3, 5 and 7 channel.</p>
