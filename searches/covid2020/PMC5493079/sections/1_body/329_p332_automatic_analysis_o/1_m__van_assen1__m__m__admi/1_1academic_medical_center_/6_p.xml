<p id="Par3006">In the training set and validation set, 190 and 163 stimuli of 13 and 7 patients, respectively, were included. The prevalence of a reactive response is 8.3 % in the training set and 3.1 % in the validation set. The non-parametric power spectral density with a difference of 30 %, in 5 second epochs, averaged over 5 channels was found to be the optimal method for automatic analysis. This resulted in a sensitivity of 92.9 % (95%CI 87.6-96.2) and a specificity of 94.8 % (95%CI 90.0-97.7) in the training set. In the validation set a sensitivity of 40.0 % (95%CI 32.5-48.0) and a specificity of 78.5 % (95%CI 71.2-84.4) were found.</p>
