<p id="Par3338">The InS:PIRE programme involved individual sessions for patients and their caregivers with a physiotherapist and a pharmacist along with interventions from medical, nursing, psychology and community services. The physiotherapist documented the incidence and pain location during the assessment. The pharmacist recorded all analgesic medications prescribed prior to admission and at their clinic visit. The patientâ€™s analgesic medication was classified according to the WHO pain ladder from zero to three, zero being no pain medication and three being treatment with a strong opioid. Data collected was part of an evaluation of a quality improvement initiative, therefore ethics approval was waived.</p>
