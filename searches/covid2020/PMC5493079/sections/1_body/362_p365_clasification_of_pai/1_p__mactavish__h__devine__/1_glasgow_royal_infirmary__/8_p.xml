<p id="Par3342">Of the patients seen at the InS:PIRE clinic two-thirds stated that they had new pain since their ICU admission. Despite the increase in the number and strength of analgesics prescribed, almost a quarter of patients still complained of pain at their clinic visit. These results confirm that pain continues to be a significant problem in this patient group. Raising awareness in primary care of the incidence of chronic pain and improving its management is essential to the recovery process following an ICU admission.</p>
