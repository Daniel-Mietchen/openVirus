 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Neutrophil play an important role as the first line of innate immune defense. Activated neutrophils become segmented and cytoplasm grows larger including granules. However, sometimes it is difficult to diffentiate whether the segmented neutrophils are on the process to grow up or not, and to decide to stop antibiotics or not. There are some reports that hyper spectral imaging (HSI) is available for analysis including diagnosis of malaria infected cells and distinction of the cells to produce antibody. In this study, we evaluated serial changes of HSI spectrum in patients with infection, and examined whether we could distinguish activated neutrophils or not.
