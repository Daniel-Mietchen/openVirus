 <bold>Methods:</bold> Sputum and urine samples were collected from the clinically ill three patients with pulmonary infection(n = 2) and urinary tract infection(UTI; n = 1). These samples were smeared on glass slides and gram stain was conducted. We observed the slides with HSI to get the hyper spectral data 10 times from each cytoplasm of neutrophil, and analyzed hyper spectral data with the software system, MultiSpec®.
