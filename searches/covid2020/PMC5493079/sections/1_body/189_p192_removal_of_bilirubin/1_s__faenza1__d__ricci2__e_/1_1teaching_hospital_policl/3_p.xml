 <bold>Results:</bold> All of the experiments showed the adsorption capacity of the system concerning Bil. (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab23" ref-type="table">23</xref>) with a minimal loss of Alb. Experiments 1&amp;2 demonstrated the capacity to adsorb protein-bound solutes. In this condition the removal of Bil. is possible only breaking the Alb.-Bil. complex. Test 3 showed a Bil. adsorption of 2.499 mg, equivalent to the removal of blood Bil. in a 70 kg patient with an initial concentration of 49,98 mg/dl. The major reduction was in the first 8 h but the cartridge maintained an adsorption capacity until the end. We could not demonstrate any release of the adsorbed Bil. in 24 h.
