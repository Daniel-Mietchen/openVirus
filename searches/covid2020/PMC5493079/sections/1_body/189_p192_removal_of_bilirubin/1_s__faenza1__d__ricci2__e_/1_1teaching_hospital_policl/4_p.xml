 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This in vitro study shows the effectiveness in removing Bil., any significant loss of Alb., the resin ability to break the Alb.-Bil complex and to adsorb irreversibly Bil. Cytosorb might represent a valid and simple aid in organ dysfunctions, without need of plasma separation. In vivo studies are ongoing to confirm the in vitro results.
