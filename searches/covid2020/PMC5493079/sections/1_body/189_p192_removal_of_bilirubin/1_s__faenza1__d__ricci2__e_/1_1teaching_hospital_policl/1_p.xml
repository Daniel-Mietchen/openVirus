 <bold>Introduction:</bold> A new sorbent (Cytosorb, Cytosorbents USA), based on blood-compatible porous polymer-beads able to adsorb hydrophobic molecules, could be a valid artificial support in many conditions of organ failure removing cytokines and toxic molecules directly from blood. At present, extracorporeal systems are based on plasma-adsorption. We performed an in vitro study on bilirubin kinetics removal to verify the systemâ€™s adsorption capacity and the ability to remove protein-bound solutes.
