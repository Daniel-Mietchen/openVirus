 <bold>Methods:</bold> We performed 3 in vitro tests. Experiments 1&amp;2 were done with equimolar solution of Albumin (Alb.)-Bilirubin (Bil.), with only Unconjugated Bil., strongly Alb.-bound [1], to verify the removal of protein-bound solutes. In the test 3, 24 h long, we tried to reproduce clinical conditions, with higher concentration of Bil. and lower of Alb. to study kinetics &amp; mass balance. Solutions were recirculated in a circuit including a peristaltic pump and CytoSorb at a flow rate of 100 ml/min. Samples were collected pre and post cartridge at different times: 0, 15, 30 min and then every 30 min until the end.
