 <bold>Results:</bold> After a retrospective study, we have noted the following: children on prolonged artificial ventilation spent on avg. 24.7 ± 3.3 bed/days. The classification by disease of children requiring intubation with prolonged ventilation was the following: Multiple development abnormalities - 31 cs (32.2 %); Brain and neuromuscular disorders - 25 cs (26.0 %); Bronchopulmonary Chronic diseases - 16 cs (16.6 %); Genetic diseases - 12 cs (12.5 %); septic conditions - 10 cs (10.4 %); Development abnormalities of diaphragm - 2 (2.0 %). In the 2nd group, our study revealed the following complications: complication of subcutaneous emphysema - 6 cs (17.1 %), but pneumomediastinum - 2 cs (5.7 %), lobar emphysema - 1 cs (2.8 %), suppurations - 2 cs (5.7 %), situations that were resolved. All children received a special critical care under the Protocol of pneumonia prophylaxis associated with artificial ventilation: gentle suctioning of secretions with closed suction systems after cuffinflation. Placing on 30° and oral hygiene for 2-3 times/day being mandatory for each one. Also, a daily hydroelectrolitic rebalancing, calculation of individual energy need and symptomatic therapy was performed. Along with the improvement of general condition, appearance or improvement of the deglutition reflex, the oral nutrition with semi-solid preparations recommenced in 5 children (22.5 %) from the first day of tracheostomy application, in 7 cs the nutrition recommenced on 3-5 day together with partial parenteral nutrition until the full resumption of oral nutrition. It is worth noticing also the significant decrease in length of stay on artificial respiration in the 2ndgroup of children (22 ± 0.9 days) compared to the 1stgroup (37 ± 1.7 days). Despite the complex therapeutic effort, due to severity of basic disease in the 1 group 15 (24.5 %) children died and in the 2nd group 3 children (8.5 %) died.
