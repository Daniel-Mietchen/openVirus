 <bold>Results:</bold> 83 patients (74.1 %) were considered suitable for GDT. The surgery name or type of surgery was not documented in 55.4 %. Oxygen delivery index (DO2I) significantly increased from baseline to the maximal level (559.27 ± 182.31 to 679.91 ± 216.27, p = &lt; 0.0001), but did not change significantly from baseline to the value at the end of the protocol (559.3 ± 21.05 vs 548.4 ± 22.37, p = 0.7243). Maximal DO2I was spontaneously achieved by 21.5 % of cases. 13.9 % of patients achieved the maximal DO2I in the 8th hour. In general, the maximal DO2I was achieved at the 4th hour, which is the same timing observed in 2009.
