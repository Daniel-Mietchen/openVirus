 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results show that relatives are more likely to be satisfied when admitted from the emergency department than the from an inpatient ward. There is a correlation between inclusion in the decision-making process and overall satisfaction. The timely manner in which patients are admitted from the emergency department (RESUS) as well as the levels of staffing on initial management may account for the results seen.
