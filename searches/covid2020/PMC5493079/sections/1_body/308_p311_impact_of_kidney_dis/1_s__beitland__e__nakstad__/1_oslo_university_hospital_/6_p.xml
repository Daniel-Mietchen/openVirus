<p id="Par2799">Among 245 included patients (84 % males, mean age 61 years), 4 % had previously known CKD and 46 % developed AKI. The AKI patients consisted of 58 (52 %) AKI stage 1, 30 (27 %) AKI stage 2, and 24 (21 %) AKI stage 3. Overall six-months outcome revealed that 46 % died and 50 % had good neurological outcome. Compared with no kidney disease, AKI patients had significantly increased mortality (odds ratio (OR) 3.17, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.95-5.43, p &lt; 0.01) and worsened neurological outcome (OR 0.29, 95 % CI 0.17-0.50, p &lt; 0.01). AKI patients with and without RRT had comparable six-month mortality (50 versus (vs.) 61 %, p = 0.40) and good neurological outcome (44 vs. 35 %, p = 0.42), also after excluding patients where RRT was withheld due to futility.</p>
