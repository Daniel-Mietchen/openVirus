 <bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective, observational study was conducted at an academic medical center and a community hospital in Utah. Adults admitted to ICUs fulfilled SIRS criteria. The attending physician and a study investigator classified patients at admission as sepsis, SIRS, or indeterminate. The reference diagnosis was determined through independent review of all clinical data at discharge by two study physicians with adjudication by a third for discordant classifications. Inter-physician admission classifications at admission and discharge were compared.
