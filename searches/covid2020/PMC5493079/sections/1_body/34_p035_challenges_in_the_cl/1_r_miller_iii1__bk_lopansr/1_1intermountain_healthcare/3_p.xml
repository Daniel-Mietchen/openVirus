 <bold>Results:</bold> Of the 210 enrolled subjects, 58 (28 %) cases had at least one physician classify the patient as indeterminate, and in 9 (4 %) there was major disagreement with the classifications of SIRS and sepsis. At discharge, in 46 (22 %) cases, at least one classification was indeterminate and in 4 (2 %) there was major disagreement between classification of SIRS and sepsis. When compared to discharge classification (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), 142 (68 %) cases initially classed as SIRS or sepsis by the attending physician remained unchanged. Of 89 patients initially diagnosed with sepsis on admission, 66 (74 %) were deemed to be correct, 8 (9 %) were deemed SIRS and 15 (17 %) indeterminate when compared to discharge classification. Of the 40 (19 %) subjects indeterminate on admission, 12 (30 %) remained so at discharge. 19 patients initially diagnosed with sepsis or SIRS became indeterminate at discharge. One patient initially classed as SIRS and 11 as indeterminate were ultimately discharged with a diagnosis of sepsis.
