 <bold>Methods:</bold> This study was conducted to examine the correlation of the Samsung IB BRAHMS PCT to the established reference methods BRAHMS PCT sensitive Kryptor and BRAHMS PCT Elecsys at two German Laboratories. The design was based on the related CLSI Guidelines EP09-A3 (Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples). The study compared PCT values using EDTA plasma determined with reference methods with results determined with Samsung IB BRAHMS PCT using EDTA whole blood and EDTA plasma over the whole measuring range of the assay in patients undergoing routine care PCT measurement.
