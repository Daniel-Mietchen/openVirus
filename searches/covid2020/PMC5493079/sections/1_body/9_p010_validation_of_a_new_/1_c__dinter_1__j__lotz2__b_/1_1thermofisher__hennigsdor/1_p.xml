 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Procalcitonin (PCT), a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for bacterial infections, is increasingly being used in the ED and ICU for the diagnostic work up of patients with LRTI and sepsis. Recently, Samsung IB BRAHMS PCT, a new point of care (POC) test, has been developed for a fast PCT measurement of whole blood and EDTA samples with a measuring range of 0.08 - 10 μg/L. The objective of this evaluation study was to determine the correlation of the Samsung IB BRAHMS PCT test to established reference methods.
