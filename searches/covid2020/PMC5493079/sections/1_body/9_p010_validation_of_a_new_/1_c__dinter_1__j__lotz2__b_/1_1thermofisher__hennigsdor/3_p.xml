 <bold>Results:</bold> 256 patients were included over a 6 weeks period. The correlation between EDTA whole blood or plasma and the reference method was r- = 0.97, the correlation of plasma and whole blood samples, both determined on the Samsung analyzer, was r = 0,98. The clinical concordance was 94 % related to a 0.5 μg/L threshold in whole blood. No significant bias was observed (0.033 and 0.034 for venous whole blood and plasma respectively, compared to the reference method). No difference was observed comparing imprecision of whole blood and plasma. The total CV was &lt; 14.5 % for concentrations between 0.45 and 4.54 μg/L. The time to result of the Samsung IB BRAHMS PCT was 20 min.
