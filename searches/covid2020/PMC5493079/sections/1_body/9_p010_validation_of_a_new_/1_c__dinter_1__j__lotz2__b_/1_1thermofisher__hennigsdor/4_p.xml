 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study found an excellent correlation and diagnostic accuracy of the new, sensitive POC device for rapid measurement of procalcitonin. The Samsung IB BRAHMS PCT test allows an accurate measurement of PCT at a point of care, where near patient testing is practical, that is comparable to established lab based BRAHMS PCT assays.
