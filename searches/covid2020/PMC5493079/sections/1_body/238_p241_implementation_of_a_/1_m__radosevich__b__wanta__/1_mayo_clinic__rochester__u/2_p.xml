 <bold>Methods:</bold> We evaluated 1302 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation prior to and after institution of a standardized, goal-directed mechanical ventilation order set. Specific goals for oxygenation (SpO2, PaO2, PEEP/FiO2 table use) and ventilation (pH, PaCO2) were selected by providers and were subsequently implemented by our RTs as they saw fit.
