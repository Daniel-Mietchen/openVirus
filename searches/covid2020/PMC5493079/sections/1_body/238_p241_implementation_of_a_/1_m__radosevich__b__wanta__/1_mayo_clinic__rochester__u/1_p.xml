 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Multiple studies have shown that low tidal volume, lung protective ventilation strategies may reduce pulmonary complications in non-ARDS ICU patients. In busy ICUs, discrepancies may arise between ventilator management goals and actual practice. We developed a goal-directed mechanical ventilation order set that included physician-specified lung-protective ventilation and oxygenation goals to be implemented by our respiratory therapists (RTs). Our primary outcomes were to determine if a simple respiratory therapist-driven order set with predefined goals regarding oxygenation and ventilation could be implemented with good compliance and to determine compliance with the ARDSNet PEEP/FiO2 table. As secondary outcomes, we evaluated duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and both in-hospital and ICU mortality.
