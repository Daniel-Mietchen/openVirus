 <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 1693 unique episodes of invasive mechanical ventilation and 1302 individual patients were analyzed. Compliance with the new mechanical ventilation order set was found to be high with a mean of 86.9 % of ventilator settings compliant with orders. The difference in order compliance before and after implementation was statistically significant (mean 1.3 % vs. 86.9 %, p &lt;0.0001). Compliance with the ARDSNet PEEP/FiO2 table after implementation of the order set was significantly greater (median of 82.9 % vs. 86 %, p = 0.02). There was no difference in duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, in-hospital or ICU mortality.
