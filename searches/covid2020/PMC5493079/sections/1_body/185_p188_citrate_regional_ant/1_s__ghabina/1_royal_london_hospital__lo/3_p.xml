 <bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective audit of the first 10 critically ill patients receiving RCA with post dilution CVVHF. Inclusion criteria: Adult critically ill patients requiring CRRT but contraindicated for heparin. Exclusion criteria:liver disease, liver injury, noradrenaline &gt;0.5mcg/kg/min, ideal body weight &gt;90 kg, receiving &gt;6 u/hr of insulin, sodium &lt;120 or &gt;160 mmol/l, pH &gt;7.5 or bicarbonate &gt; 40 mmol/l. Primary outcome measure-filter time Secondary outcome measures:calcium replacement; Post filter ionised calcium (iCa); acid base status and serum sodium levels. A dose choice of 25 or 35 mls/kg/min with parallel changes to the filtration fraction from 20 to 25 % as required to manage metabolic alkalosis. If metabolic alkalosis persisted, RCA was stopped. Acid Citrate Dextrose Forumula-A (ACD-A) (113 mmol/L of citrate) is administered at a weight related rate aiming for a citrate concentration of 2.5-3 %. Replacement fluid is Accusol 35 (1.75 mmol/l calcium). A post filter solution of 10 mmol/l calcium chloride is administered according to post filter ionized calcium (iCa).Bicarbonate, iCa and sodium measured at 3 to 6 hourly intervals during therapy.
