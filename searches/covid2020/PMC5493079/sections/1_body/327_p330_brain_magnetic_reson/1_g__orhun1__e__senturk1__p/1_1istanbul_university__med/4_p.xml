<p id="Par2988">Twenty patients with septic shock and brain dysfunction symptoms (acute alterations in mental status, delirium, coma, seizures and focal neurological deficits) [median age 54Â years (26 to 65), APACHE II: 21 (15 to 29), SOFA: 8(1 to 15)] underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including gradient echo T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2-weighted and diffusion isotropic images, and mapping of apparent diffusion coefficient. MRI findings were classified based on lesion types and localizations. Blood was withdrawn simultaneously for biomarker analysis. Neurological recovery of all patients were evaluated using Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) during discharge.</p>
