 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia in critically ill patients. However, data evaluating AF in the non-cardiac intensive care setting are limited. The objective of this study was to describe the incidence, management and outcome of new-onset AF in patients admitted to non-cardiac intensive care.
