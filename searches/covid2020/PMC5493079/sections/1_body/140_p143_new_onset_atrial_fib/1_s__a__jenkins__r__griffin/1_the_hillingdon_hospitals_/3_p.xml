 <bold>Results:</bold> The study population consisted of 330 critically ill patients admitted to the ICU during the 10-month period. The incidence of new-onset AF was 10 % (n = 33). 55 % of patients with new-onset AF were male and mean age was 73 ± 11 years. The medical notes were available for review for 26/33 patients. Patients with new-onset AF frequently had evidence of sepsis (81 %), respiratory failure (62 %), circulatory shock (38 %) and acute kidney injury (31 %). Mean ICU day when AF occurred was 2.6 (range 1 - 10). Rhythm control strategy was used as first-line therapy for the majority of patients: 81 % received intravenous amiodarone and 12 % underwent electrical cardioversion for haemodynamic instability. 23 % received beta-blockers and 23 % digoxin as second-line therapy. 69 % of patients were anticoagulated with heparin infusion or therapeutic-dose low-molecular-weight-heparin. 31 % remained in AF at time of ICU discharge. New-onset AF was associated with longer ICU length of stay (median 6 days versus 3 days, p = 0.04) but not hospital mortality.
