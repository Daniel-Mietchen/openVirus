 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although in Italian PICUs persists a tendency to apply restrictive visiting policies, these findings suggests that a revision of current policies is underway and that over the last eight years there has been perceptible change in favour of the liberalization of visiting in the Italian pediatric critical care setting. Despite the many objections considered valid in the past, there is conclusively no scientific basis for limiting family presence in ICU [2].
