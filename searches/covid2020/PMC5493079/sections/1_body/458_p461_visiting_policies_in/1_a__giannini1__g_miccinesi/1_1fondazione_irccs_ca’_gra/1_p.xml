 <bold>Introduction:</bold> In 2007 we found a clear tendency in Italian PICUs to apply restrictive visiting policies [1]. However, we also pointed out that a formal process of revision of the wardâ€™s visiting policies was underway in roughly half of the units. Therefore, we carried out a new national survey to evaluate this issue in Italian PICUs.
