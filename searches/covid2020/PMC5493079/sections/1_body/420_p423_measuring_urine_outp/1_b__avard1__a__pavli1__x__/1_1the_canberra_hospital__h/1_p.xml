 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The significance of tracking urine output as a marker for patient deterioration on general wards remains unclear. We aimed to explore the utility of measurement of urine output in patients including those who deteriorated and required Intensive Care support and a cohort who did not, from both medical and surgical wards in a large metropolitan hospital in Australia. Of note this hospital had a program to recognise and respond to deteriorating patients well embedded, which included a modified early warning score and track &amp; trigger response.
