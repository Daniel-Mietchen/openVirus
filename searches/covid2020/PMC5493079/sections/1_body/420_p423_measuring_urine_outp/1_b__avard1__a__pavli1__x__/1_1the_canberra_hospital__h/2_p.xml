 <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective cross sectional analysis was performed on 440 patients admitted to our hospital over a six month time period. We excluded patients with premorbid renal insufficiency or requiring dialysis prior to admission as these patients would have skewed results. We collected data on urine output, modified early warning scores, when patients were admitted to ICU the timing of deterioration being recognised and responded to, patient length of stay and mortality.All data was subsequently analysed using SPSS software. Ethics approval was obtained for this research.
