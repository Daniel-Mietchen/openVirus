 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This research suggests that urine output remains a vital component of our recognition of deteriorating patients and our focus should be on improving routine measurement of this parameter rather than removing this from modified early warning scores.More reliable measurement may allow further investigation as to whether earlier intervention based on this parameter may improve patient outcome.
