 <bold>Results:</bold> Only 9% of the ward patients had urine output measures performed, irrespective of whether they deteriorated to the point of ICU admission or remained on the ward. Despite this, those patients who had a low urine output recorded on the ward and who were subsequently admitted to ICU continued to have a lower mean output in the first 24 hours of their ICU stay. A statistically significant association was found between reduction in urine output and increased hospital mortality with a mortality rate of 7.9% in those with reduced output compared with 1.3% with normal output for those patients who were not subsequently admitted to ICU, with an even more pronounced correlation in those who deteriorated to the point of requiring ICU admission. 25% of those patients who received a medical review in response to deterioration may not have elicited a review if the urine output had not been monitored and included in the activation criteria.
