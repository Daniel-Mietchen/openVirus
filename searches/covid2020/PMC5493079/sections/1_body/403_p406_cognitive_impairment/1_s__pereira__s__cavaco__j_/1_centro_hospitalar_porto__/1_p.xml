 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Survivors of critical illness often have an incapacitating form of cognitive, psychological and functional impairment but the potential reversibility of these clinical conditions 5 years after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge remains inadequately understood. Our aim is to evaluate long-term cognitive impairment, psychological morbidity and quality of life 5 years after ICU discharge.
