 <bold>Results:</bold> During the study period, 26 patients were evaluated in the outpatient clinic 6 months after ICU discharge, with a mean age of 63 ± 16 years; of these, 18 were re-evaluated 5 years after ICU discharge. Twelve (46 %) patients presented cognitive impairment (DRS-2 &lt; 10 percentile) in the first evaluation and 3 (17 %) at 5 years (p = 0.063). Anxiety and depression at 6 months was present in 5 (19 %) and 4 (15 %), at 5 years only 2 patients reported anxiety and none had depression. Evaluation with SF-36 did not show significant differences in the physical function [53 (39-75) vs 64 (43-94), p = 0.619], physical pain [78 (39-90) vs 58 (35-100), p = 0.810], general health [59 (39-68) vs 62 (42-71), p = 0.845], vitality [63 (38-80) vs 56 (22-78), p = 0.276], social function [50 (38-63) vs 100 (25-100), p = 0.179], emotional performance [100 (0-100) vs 100 (67-100), p = 0.091] and mental health [66 (54-86) vs 67 (29-79), p = 0.098]; differences were found in physical performance [100 (0-100) vs 89 (41-100), p = 0.010] and in health status change for worse: 4 (15 %) vs. 6 (33 %) patients (p = 0.018). Evaluation with EQ-5-D showed that 27 % vs. 50 % (p = 0.031) had some problems in self-care, 46 % vs. 58 % (p = 0.549) in usual activities, 62 % vs. 62 % (p = 1.000) reported pain/discomfort, 58 % vs. 65 % (p = 0.727) some problems in motility and 50 % vs. 50 % (p = 1.000) anxiety/depression; visual analogue scale was 80 (50-80) at 6 months vs. 60 (50-82)points at 5 years (p = 0.599).
