 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Patient selection for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in refractory cardiogenic shock, in particular the early recognition of futility, remains a significant clinical challenge. Previous case series and the SAVE score [1] have focussed on variables that predict in-hospital mortality. The early identification of those patients who are likely to deteriorate and die within 48Â hours despite VA-ECMO is an attractive paradigm to guide clinical decision making and improve appropriate resource utilization.
