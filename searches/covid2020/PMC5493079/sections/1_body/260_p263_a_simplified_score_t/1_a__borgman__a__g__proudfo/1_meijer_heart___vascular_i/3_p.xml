 <bold>Results:</bold> 141 patients were included. 48 h-mortality was 16 % (22 patients) with an in-hospital mortality of 43 %. The model demonstrated good discriminatory power AUC = 0.79 (Bootstrap 95 % CI = 0.68 to 0.88) and good calibration. Arterial pH shows the strongest association with mortality in our model (Fig.
