 <bold>Methods:</bold> Data were retrospectively collected from the records of consecutive patients supported with VA-ECMO at Spectrum Health between January 2010 and October 2015. Based on a review of the current literature, 8 candidate predictors of 48 h-mortality were expertly selected (Image 1); the ‘worst’ value within the 24 hours prior to ECMO cannulation was considered for modeling. Ridge regression [2] was used to develop a risk prediction model and cross validation applied to select the optimal tuning parameter. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and calibration was assessed using several common indices.
