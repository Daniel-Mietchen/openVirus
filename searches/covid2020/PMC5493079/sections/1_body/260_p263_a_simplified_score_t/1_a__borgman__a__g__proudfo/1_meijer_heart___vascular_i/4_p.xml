 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In a small retrospective cohort study, an 8-parameter score of pre-ECMO variables predicted mortality with an AUC of 0.789. Whilst validation and optimisation in a larger cohort is required, the use of pre-ECMO variables corresponds with medical decision-making in real-time, enhancing clinical utility in the acute-setting.
