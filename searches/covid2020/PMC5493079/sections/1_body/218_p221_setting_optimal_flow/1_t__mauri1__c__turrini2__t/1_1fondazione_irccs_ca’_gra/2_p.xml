 <bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a prospective randomized cross-over study on 4 acute respiratory failure patients admitted to the ICU with PaO[sub]2[/sub]/FiO[sub]2[/sub] &lt; =300 mmHg. FiO[sub]2[/sub] was set to obtain SpO[sub]2[/sub] of 90-95 % by facial mask and left unchanged during the study. All patients underwent 4 randomized steps (20 min): 1. Facial mask at 12 L/min; 2. HFNC at 30 L/min; 3. HFNC at 45 L/min; 4. HFNC at 60 L/min. During all phases, continuous recordings of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) data calibrated by spirometry and esophageal pressure (Pes) tracings were obtained.
