 <bold>Results:</bold> At higher flow rates, PaO[sub]2[/sub]/FiO[sub]2[/sub] improved (mask: 162 ± 78 vs. HFNC 30: 187 ± 82 vs. HFNC 45: 199 ± 79 vs. HFNC 60: 198 ± 68 mmHg; p &lt; 0.005) and Borg dyspnea score decreased (6.2 ± 3.0 vs. 5.0 ± 2.4 vs. 5.0 ± 2.4 vs. 4.2 ± 1.7; p &lt; 0.05). Pes swings, a measure of patients’ inspiratory effort, decreased with HFNC (10.9 ± 5.5 vs. 7.9 ± 2.9 vs. 8.1 ± 4.1 vs. 7.4 ± 2.8 cmH[sub]2[/sub]O; p &lt; 0.05). Peak inspiratory flow (PIF), as assessed by EIT [2], decreased at higher flow rates (60.6 ± 27.5 vs. 53.2 ± 22.5 vs. 53.9 ± 24.1 vs. 50.0 ± 21.4 L/min; p &lt; 0.05), suggesting decreased respiratory drive. Interestingly, when patient’s PIF exceeded the flow delivered by each external source, oxygenation was lower, likely indicating higher discrepancy between externally set and alveolar FiO[sub]2[/sub]’s (Fig.
