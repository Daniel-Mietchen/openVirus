 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This exploratory study suggests an association between Ptp and DDE as dorsal lung is recruited by increasing PEEP. If validated in a larger sample, ultrasound evaluation of dorsal diaphragmatic movement may be a non-invasive method for estimating lung recruitment in ARDS.
