 <bold>Results:</bold> Acceptable ultrasound images of diaphragm excursion were obtained in 6 of 7 patients; one patient had a large hepatic cyst precluding diaphragm ultrasound, data from this subject was excluded from the analysis. At enrollment, the mean(+/-SD) P/F ratio was 156+/-61 mmHg, mean baseline PEEP was 12.7+/-2.2 cmH2O, and the mean SpO2 was 94+/-2.2 %. Ventral diaphragmatic excursions were unchanged by PEEP. Increasing PEEP resulted in corresponding increases in Ptp and DDE (p = .0006, p = .005). The transition from a negative to positive Ptp with increasing PEEP occurred as DDE was observed to markedly increase.
