 <bold>Methods:</bold> In this proof-of-concept study, we enrolled 7 ARDS patients treated with invasive mechanical ventilation and neuromuscular blockade in the supine position. We measured Ptp using esophageal manometry and ventral/dorsal diaphragm excursions using anatomic M-mode ultrasonography as the applied PEEP was changed (set by the treating physician) as follows: +3,+6, -3, and -6 cmH2O. A standard lung history was established by recruitment maneuvers between each PEEP change, and the sequence of PEEP changes was randomized for each subject. We used linear mixed effects models to evaluate for an association between applied PEEP and Ptp and dorsal diaphragmatic excursion (DDE).
