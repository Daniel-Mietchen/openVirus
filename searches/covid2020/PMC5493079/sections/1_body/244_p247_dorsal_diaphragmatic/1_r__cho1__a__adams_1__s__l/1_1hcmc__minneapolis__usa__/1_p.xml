 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Optimizing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients to attain lung recruitment while avoiding over-distension is a clinical challenge. Methods of titrating PEEP to safely recruit the lungs have included achieving adequate SpO2, attaining best compliance, or increasing PEEP while monitoring esophageal manometry to establish a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (Ptp). Bedside ultrasonography is available and useful as a diagnostic tool in the care of critically ill patients. Preliminary work identified marked differences in excursions between the dorsal and ventral diaphragms during lung-protective tidal ventilation in ARDS patients. We hypothesize that lung recruitment in the supine patient may be detected non-invasively by increased dorsal diaphragmatic excursions, indicating that dependent lung regions may be recruiting with adequate PEEP.
