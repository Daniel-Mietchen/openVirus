 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Updating equipment in Critical Care is important to improve practice but changing to a new service involves a significant amount of effort from initial planning to final launch. This study was designed to evaluate the stages of implementation, quantify the time spent and the cost of updating our nitric oxide delivery service. Nitric Oxide is one of the most expensive therapies currently used in our Hospital accounting for over 700,000 Euros (€) per annum. Estimated cost savings (€350,000) have to be weighed against clinical risk and the cost of implementing a new device.
