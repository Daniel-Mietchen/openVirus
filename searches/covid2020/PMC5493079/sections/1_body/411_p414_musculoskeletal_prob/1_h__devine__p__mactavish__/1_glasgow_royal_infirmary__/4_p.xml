 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Musculoskeletal problems especially shoulder pain and bilateral LL pain and weakness remain a significant problem for survivors of critical illness. This may have implications regarding falls risks, exercise capacity and reduce the likelihood of patients returning to work. Shoulder pain was found to be one of the most common complaints of pain supporting other research [1] with contributing factors such as the position of ventilator tubing, dialysis lines or central lines hypothesised. Collecting this data has helped raise awareness of these problems and may strengthen the case for more equipment for active mobilisation in ICU and herald a need for increased understanding in downstream wards on ICUAW.
