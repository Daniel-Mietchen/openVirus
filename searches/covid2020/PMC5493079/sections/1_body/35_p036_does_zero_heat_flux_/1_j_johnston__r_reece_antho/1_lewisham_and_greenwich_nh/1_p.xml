 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Temperature measurement is an essential component for decision making on intensive care both in the context of identifying and treating sepsis and also in accurate calibration of blood gas analysis. SpotOn™ a Zero Heat Flux Cutaneous thermometer has been validated as a non-invasive, continuous and accurate method of measuring temperature in patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the operative and peri-operative period.1 We compared SpotOn™ with Axilla thermometers, our current method of non-invasive temperature monitoring, to establish how inaccurate our current practice was.
