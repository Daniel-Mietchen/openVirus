 <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 435 comparative values were recorded over a range of 34.4C to 38.5C. On average the SpotOn™ thermometer recorded temperatures 0.14C above the Axilla (95 % CI +/-0.04 with a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test p &lt; 0.0001). The average difference between SpotOn™ and Axilla over a normal range (36-37.4C) was 0.07 (95 % CI +/- 0.04) p = 0.0028. The average difference between SpotOn™ and Axilla at hypothermic temperatures (&lt;36C) was -0.1 (95%CI +/-0.11 p = 0.13). The average difference between SpotOn™ and Axilla at hyperthermic temperatures (&gt; = 37.5C) was 0.53C (95%CI +/- 0.11 p &lt; 0.0001). There were 12 occasions when the SpotOn™ thermometer identified a SIRS defined temperature (&lt;36 or &gt; =38.3C) that the Axilla temperature did not, affecting 10 of the 25 patients.
