 <bold>Methods:</bold> The antimicrobial performance (30 days) of non-leaching anti-microbial CVCs on 7 typical CVC-associated infection bacteria was tested with the “Roll-Out” method (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus MRSA and E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerugionosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans). After inoculation, washing, incubation at 37 °C, immersion in a minimum medium solution, and a second washing process, the catheter sample was placed on an agar plate and rolled 3 times over the agar plate to transfer surface bound bacteria to the agar medium. After overnight incubation (37 °C), bacterial growth was recorded by photography.
