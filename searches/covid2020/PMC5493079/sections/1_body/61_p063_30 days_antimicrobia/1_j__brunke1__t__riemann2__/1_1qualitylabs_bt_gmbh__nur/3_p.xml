 <bold>Results:</bold> The present in-vitro data demonstrate that non-leaching antimicrobial CVCs (e.g. Certofix® Protect, B.BRAUN) exhibit antimicrobial efficacy and prevent biofilm formation from gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria and fungi for up to 30 days. The study was performed in direct comparison with a non-antimicrobial control catheter, on which all 7 test strains were able to grow to an established surface biofilm.
