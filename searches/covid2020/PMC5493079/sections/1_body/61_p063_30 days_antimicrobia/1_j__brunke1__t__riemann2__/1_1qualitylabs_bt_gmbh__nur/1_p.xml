 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Central venous catheters (CVCs) are widely used in intensive care but increase the incidence of adverse events, especially catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSIs). Coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as S. epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, are the most frequent cause of CRBSIs. These bacteria grow because a biofilm has developed. The inhibition of bacterial growth by antimicrobial catheters helps to prevent surface colonization and improve safety. CertofixÂ® Protect is the third generation of CVC, with non-leaching additives and antimicrobial activity from the catheter tip to the connectors.
