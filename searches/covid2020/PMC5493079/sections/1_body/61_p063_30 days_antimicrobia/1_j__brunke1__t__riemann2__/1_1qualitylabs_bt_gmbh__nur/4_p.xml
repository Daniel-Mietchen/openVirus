 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first in-vitro study to demonstrate antibacterial surface activity and prevention of biofilm formation with antimicrobial, non-leaching CVCs by using the “Roll-Out” method over a period of 30 days. These results demonstrate that non-leaching antimicrobial CVCs can prevent microbial colonization and infection.
