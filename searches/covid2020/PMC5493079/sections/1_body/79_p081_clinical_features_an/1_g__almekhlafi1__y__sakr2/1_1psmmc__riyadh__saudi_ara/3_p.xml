 <bold>Results:</bold> During the observation period, 31 patients were identified as having MERS-CoV infection (mean age 59 ± 20 years, 71 % males). The median number of concomitant comorbid conditions was 3 (IQ: 2-4). The initial clinical manifestations of the MERS-CoV infections had occurred at a median of 2 days (IQ: 2-4) prior to hospital admission. Cough and tachypnea were reported in all patients, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were evident in 77.4 % of cases. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 87.1 % of the patients during the ICU stay, vasopressor therapy in 80.6 %, and renal replacement therapy in 51.6 %. The overall ICU mortality rate was 74.2 %. The median ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 9 (IQ: 4-16) and 12 (IQ: 4-16) days, respectively. Nonsurvivors were older (63 ± 19 vs. 46 ± 20 years, p = 0.48), had greater APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission to the ICU, and were more likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation (95.7 vs. 62.5 %, p = 0.48) and vasopressor therapy (95.7 vs. 37.5 %, p = 0.002).
