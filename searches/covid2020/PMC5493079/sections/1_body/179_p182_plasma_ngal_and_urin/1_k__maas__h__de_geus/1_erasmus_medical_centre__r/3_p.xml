 <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 59 patients developed any stage of AKI during the first 7 days after ICU admission, 15 patients required RRT eventually. At the time of first AKI, pNGAL and UO were the only parameters that differed significantly (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04 respectively) between the two groups. The “classical parameters” showed a significant difference between groups later on at the time of peak AKI (=time of RRT initiation) (Fig.
