 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Acute kidney injury (AKI) is independently associated with increased mortality in the critically ill, especially when renal replacement therapy (RRT) is required. “Early initiation” of RRT and its possible beneficial effect on mortality, has been the focus of many research protocols. However, published papers show no uniformity in the definition of early initiation. The main problem to determine this best moment of initiation is the lack of a distinctive parameter that can predict RRT requirement. The question rises if differences between patients with any stage of AKI and patients with RRT-requiring AKIN stage III can be identified looking at the “classical parameters” (serum creatinine (SCr), urea, potassium, bicarbonate, pH, cumulative fluid balance), plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (pNGAL) and urinary output (UO) at the time of first rise in SCr (first AKI).
