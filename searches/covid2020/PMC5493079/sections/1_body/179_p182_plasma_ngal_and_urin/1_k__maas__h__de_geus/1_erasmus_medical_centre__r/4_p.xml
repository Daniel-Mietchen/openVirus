 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Critically ill patients with RRT requiring AKI have a significant lower urinary production and significant higher pNGAL concentration compared to patients with non-RRT requiring AKI at the time of first rise in SCr. The “classical parameters” fail to make this distinction at this very early stage of AKI. Therefore, plasma NGAL and UO might have the potential (perhaps in combination with the Furosemide stress test) to become valuable parameters in future prospective protocols that intend to study the value of early RRT initiation on hard outcome measures in critically ill patients.
