 <bold>Introductions:</bold> HAGMA is a commonly encountered acid-base disorder in clinic practice. Multiple mnemonics were proposed to cover the common underlying causes – “GOLDMARK(1)”, “KUSMALE”, “KARMEL” and, of course, “MUDPILES”. The “I” in “MUDPILES” represents some rare causes of HAGMA including “I”ron, “I”soniazid and “I”nborn errors of metabolism. We present a rare case of HAGMA secondary to isoniazid (INH) overdose.
