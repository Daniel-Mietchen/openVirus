 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Tuberculosis is endemic is South East Asia. INH is one of the four drugs used in the treatment of this disease. Side effects of isoniazid range from mild hepatotoxicity to the potentially fatal INH hepatitis. HAGMA refractory to conventional therapy is one of the hallmarks of INH toxicity. Though it is one of the rare causes of HAGMA, prompt diagnosis and treatment with high dose pyridoxine (2) reduces mortality and morbidity.
