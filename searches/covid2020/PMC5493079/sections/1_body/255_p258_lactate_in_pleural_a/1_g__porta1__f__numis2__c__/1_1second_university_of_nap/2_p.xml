 <bold>Methods:</bold> We collected data of 30 patients who had clinical indication for thoracentesis or paracentesis.For each patient we performed arterial blood gas with lactate,total protein and serum LDH dosage,acid-base assessment with lactate,total protein and LDH dosage,cytology and bacterial culture on the fluid.Of every patient we calculated “liquid/serum” lactate ratio in order to measure the eventually present increase in pleural or abdominal effusion.The diagnosis of the liquid effusion nature (exudate or transudate) was performed by Light’s criteria.A statistical analysis was carried out by performing a ROC curve in order to find the best cut-off for liquid/serum lactate ratio predicting the presence of an exudate.
