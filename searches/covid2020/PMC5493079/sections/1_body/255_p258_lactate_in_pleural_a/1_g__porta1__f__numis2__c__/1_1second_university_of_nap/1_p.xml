 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the increase in lactate in pleural and abdominal effusion can be used as a criterion for the differential diagnosis of the nature of the fluid (transudate or exudate).The presence of pleural or abdominal effusion is a frequent finding in patients in the ICU and Internal Medicine Department.It is possible to distinguish between transudate and exudate by Lightâ€™s criteria[1,2].Pursuing an acid-base assessment of the fluid,we have noticed an increase in the value of lactate,beyond the blood range,in the cases that were diagnosed like exudate to the calculation of Light criteria[4].The advantages of this test is that it is a simple test,executable by the physician and his result is available within few minutes.
