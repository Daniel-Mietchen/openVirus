 <bold>Results:</bold> Of the 30 patients (13 [43 %] males and 17 [57 %] females, mean age 65,53 ± 13,271 years) 15 had peritoneal effusion and 15 had pleural effusion,15 patients had a exudate and 15 a transudate by Light’s criteria.We performed a ROC curve to predict the presence of exudate by the liquid serum lactate ratio and we obtained an AuROC of 0.69 with the best cut-off value of 2,02 (Sensitivity 0,73 and Specificity 0,73). When we performed the same analysis only on pleural effusion patients we obtanined a an AuROC of 0,78 with the best cut-off value of 2,13 (Sensitivity 0,7, Specificity 1,0).
