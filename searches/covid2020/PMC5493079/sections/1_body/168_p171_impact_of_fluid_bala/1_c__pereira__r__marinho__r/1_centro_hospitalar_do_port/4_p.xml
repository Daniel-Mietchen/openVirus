 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study demonstrated that the cumulative fluid balance was higher in patients who had more severe dysfunctions of the systems reviewed, and these were associated with increased mortality rate. What remains to be established is whether fluid overload is only a biomarker that puts patients under an increased risk of death or an iatrogenic condition from critical care that should be considered in daily care and actively treated and avoided.
