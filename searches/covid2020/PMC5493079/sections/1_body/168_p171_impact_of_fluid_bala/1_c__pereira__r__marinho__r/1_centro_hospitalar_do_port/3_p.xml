 <bold>Results:</bold> 122 patients were enrolled, where 64,3 % were men, with an average age of 58 ± 16, mortality rate was 22,3 %. The average daily FB in the eight days was 520.3 ± 1549.3 ml. There was a lower daily FB among survivors compared to nonsurvivors (433.8 ± 1483.7 ml vs 876.9 ± 1755.8 ml, p0.005). The cumulative fluid balance (cFB) difference between survivor / nonsurvivors was significant at the 8th day of ICU (p = 0.037). Regarding the cFB and the respiratory system, it was found that patients with a ratio PO2/FiO2 &lt; =200 had a higher cFB between the 4th and 8th day. In the group of patients who required vasopressor support, cFB was higher in the 2nd and 3rd days (p = 0.04 and p = 0.036, respectively). The group of patients with a GFR &lt;75 ml/min/1.73 m2 presented cFB slightly higher than the group with higher GFR (2nd and 4th days p = 0.049 e p = 0.041, respectively).
