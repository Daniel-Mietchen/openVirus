 <bold>Methods:</bold> We identified hospital cases with severe sepsis between 2007-2013 from the “DRG-Statistik”, a database of nearly all German inpatient cases, by the specific ICD-10 code R65.1 (sepsis with organ dysfunction). Focus of infection was abstracted from documented diagnoses for each case. For comparison data on focus of infection was abstracted from a point prevalence study [1] and a prospective cohort study [2] of severe sepsis in German ICU’s. Patients could have more than one focus in all three groups.
