 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Cancer has grown steadily in ICU. The cancer patients are gradually improving the treatment of the underlying disease, both the earlier diagnosis, as most effective treatment, this lead to a better prognosis. And the prospect is that these numbers reach higher proportions over the years. But when you have to decide how much admission or not in a ICU? Based on this question we decided to retrospectively (nearly two years) evaluate the results of hospitalization of patient with or without cancer, and compare their major clinical outcomes. This study aimed to improve the knowledge of the main clinical outcomes of cancer patients in the ICU of a large private hospital. Can we break the paradigm that cancer patients may have a non-significantly different evolution of a patient without cancer admitted to the ICU?
