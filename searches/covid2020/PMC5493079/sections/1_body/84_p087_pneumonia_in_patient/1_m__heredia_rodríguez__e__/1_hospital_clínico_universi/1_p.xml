 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Despite the significant impact of nosocomial infections on the morbidity and mortality of patients staying in the intensive care unit (ICU), no study over the past 20Â years has focused specifically on pneumonia following secondary peritonitis. Our objective is to determine epidemiological features and in-hospital mortality of pneumonia in this kind of patients.
