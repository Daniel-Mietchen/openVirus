 <bold>Results:</bold> The incidence of pneumonia following secondary peritonitis was 9.6 %. Risk factors associated with the development of pneumonia were hospital-acquired peritonitis, &gt;48 h of mechanical ventilation, and SOFA score. The onset of pneumonia was late in majority of patients (about 16.8 days after the initiation of the peritonitis), and the etiological microorganisms responsible for it were different than for peritonitis. The 90-day in-hospital mortality rate was 47.5 % of pneumonia patients. Independent factors associated with 30–90-day in-hospital mortality were pneumonia and SOFA score
