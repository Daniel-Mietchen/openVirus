<p id="Par2924">We cooled comatose patients (unable to respond to verbal commands) survived to OOH-CA from TV/FV since the implementation of a MTH protocol between May 2014 and May 2015 at Pescara Spirito Santo Hospital, a second-level hospital serving 300000 people. MTH was induced after ROSC by intravenous 70 ml/Kg Ringer’s Lactate over 30′ and maintained, after ICU admission, by a temperature-regulated surface device (Arctic Sun®, Medival, Padova, Italy; target temperature 33 °C, 0.5 °C/hours). Rewarming started 24 hours from induction (target 36.5 °C, 0.5 °C/hours); device pads were left on site for 24 hours after normothermia was achieved. Neurological sequelae were investigated before ICU discharging (clinical evaluation, CT scan and EEG) and 3 months after, by telephonic interview.</p>
