 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Both Df and ROTEM appear to provide independent information about the coagulation system across the sepsis spectrum. This could be due to the difference in the activation of the coagulation pathway. Whereas whole unadulterated blood was used in determining Df (immediately activated through contact after collection of the sample), ROTEM utilises blood that is deactivated with sodium citrate, and reactivated through tissue factor or contact activation. This study concludes that ROTEM do not provide information about the clot microstructure.
