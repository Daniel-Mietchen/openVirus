 <bold>Introduction:</bold> ROTEM is a viscoelastic test of coagulation, and has been investigated as a tool for evaluating haemostasis in sepsis [1]. It has been shown that a hypocoagulable viscoelastic profile is associated with poor outcomes in patients with severe sepsis [2]. ROTEM measures several parameters that provide information on the kinetics and structure of the developing clot. Clot microstructure (Df) on the other hand evaluates a single parameter that quantifies microstructural properties of the clot. The aim of this study was to compare the new biomarker, Df and ROTEM in patients across the sepsis spectrum (sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock).
