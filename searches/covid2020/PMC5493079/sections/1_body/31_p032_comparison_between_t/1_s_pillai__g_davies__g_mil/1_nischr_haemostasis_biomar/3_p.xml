 <bold>Results:</bold> 95 patients were included in the study: 49 with sepsis, 19 with severe sepsis and 27 with septic shock. 44 healthy volunteers were recruited as a matched control. Df correlated significantly with both structural and kinetic ROTEM parameters (p &lt; 0.05), however the correlations were weak (Pearson Correlation &lt;0.4). The strongest correlation was observed between Df and INTEM Clot Formation Time (CFT), with a moderate correlation coefficient of -0.428. Df also correlated significantly with ROTEM lysis parameters (LI45, LI60), but these correlations were also weak.
