 <bold>Results:</bold> 1897 patients were included, post-operative AKI occurred in 128 (6.8 %), of these 101 had KDIGO stage 1 (5.4 %), 19 stage 2 (1 %) and 8 stage 3 (0.4 %). Patients who developed AKI were significantly older, had a lower baseline eGFR, were in a higher ASA class and spent longer in hospital post-operatively compared to those without AKI. Hospital Mortality occurred in 17/128 (13.3 %) of patients that developed AKI post-operatively compared to only 16/1741 (0.9 %) of those that did not (p &lt; 0.001). However by a year of surgery 34/94 (27 %) of patients who developed post-operative AKI had died compared to only 106/1741 (6 %) who had not had AKI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig47" ref-type="fig">47</xref>), p &lt; 0.001. In the multi-variable model accenting for multiple confounders AKI was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 3.0 (1.91-4.72) in the year after surgery. Importantly AKI defined by only a 26 μmol/L creatinine rise and AKI with recovery remained associated with on-going ibcreased risk of death to one year.
