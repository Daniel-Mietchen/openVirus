 <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective study of major non-cardiac surgery in a teaching hospital over an 18 month examining the incidence of AKI with one-year follow-up. AKI was defined by KDIGO creatinine criteria. Major surgery was defined as inpatient procedures of &gt;1 h duration. To assess the independent effect of AKI on survival, a multi-variable Cox proportional-hazard survival model was developed.
