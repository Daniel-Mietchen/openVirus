The mean age of the patients was 36.6. 79 cyclists (14.8 %) presented following a road traffic collision involving at least one vehicle. There was a wide spectrum of injuries with upper limb injuries sustained in 43 % (n = 243), head injuries in 16 % (n = 89) and facial injuries in 11 % (n = 84). 11 (2.1 %) patients were included in TARN with ISS varying from 4 to 24. An ISS ¡Ý15 is defined as major trauma and in our cohort, 5 patients fulfilled this criteria including 2 mortalities. These injuries included pneumothoraces, haemothoraces, spinal fractures, intracranial haemorrhage and skull fractures. All of these patients required intensive care review with 3 patients being admitted to the ICU.</p>
