<p id="Par3299">The Central Statistics Office Ireland (CSO) reported following the 2011 census that there was a 9.6Â % increase in the number of people cycling to work compared with 2006. This leads to a higher prevalence of injuries and hospital attendances. The Road Safety Authority (RSA) conclude from their most recent research that there were 639 cycling associated collisions in 2012. We hypothesise that both the true number of cycling injuries and the major trauma that results from cycling collisions is being under-reported and this is placing a significant demand on Emergency Departments (EDs) and Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in Ireland.</p>
