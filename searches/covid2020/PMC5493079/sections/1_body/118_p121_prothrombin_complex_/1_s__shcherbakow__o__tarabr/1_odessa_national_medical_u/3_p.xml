 <bold>Results:</bold> According to LPTEG indicators patients with massive postpartum bleeding had abnormality in all parts of hemostatic system: platelet aggregation - Intensity of contact coagulation(ICC) was reduced by 45.64 %, the coagulation - Intensity of coagulation drive(ICD) was less than normal at 59.32 %, clot maximum density (MA) was reduced by 88.15 % and fibrinolytic activity - Index of retraction and clot lysis(IRCL) was 86,16 % above the norm. Indicators of platelet hemostasis in patients of 1st group characterized by persistence of hypoagregation: ICC was reduced by 18.69 %, compared to the norm; parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis have reliable trend toward normal and decreasing the activity of fibrinolysis index reaches normal reference values (ICD was less than normal at 10.65 %, MA was reduced by 19.31 %, IRCL was 15,21 % above the norm) 2 hours after, and became to the normal 4 hours after infusion of PCC. Patients of 2nd group had hypoagregation and mild hypocoagulation state with increased active of fibrinolysis: ICC was reduced by 22.79 %, ICD reduced by 20.79 %, MA was reduced by 30.54 %, IRCL was above the norm to 25.46 % 4 hours after, and became to the normal 6 hours after infusion of FFP. Clinically patients of the 1st group had reducing signs blood loss, decreased volume of transfusion PRBC for 11 % and decreasing volume of infusion therapy for 19 % compared to patients of 2 ng group. There was 1 case of transfusion related lung injury in 2nd group.
