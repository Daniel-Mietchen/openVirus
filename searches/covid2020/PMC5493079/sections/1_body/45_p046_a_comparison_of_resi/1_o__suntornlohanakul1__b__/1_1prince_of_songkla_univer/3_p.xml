 <bold>Results:</bold> The response rate was 136 (89 %) from 153 residents. The residents included 46 (33 %) interns, 42 (30 %) internal medicine residents, 41 (30 %) surgical residents and 7 (5 %) emergency residents. Regarding the definition of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, only 44 (32.3 %) residents were able to differentiate the severity of sepsis. Internal medicine residents have a significantly higher rate of correct answers than non-medicine and surgical residents (45.2 % vs. 26.6 %, P = 0.03 and 45.2 % vs. 12.2 %, P = 0.001). Only 77 (51 %) residents would measure blood lactate in sepsis patients, and there is no difference in overall knowledge about lactate measurement and interpretation between, internal medicine residents compared with other residents. In fluid resuscitation, all residents (95.6 %) chose normal saline solution as their first choice. However, in respects to the dose of fluid resuscitation, only 28 (20.5 %) residents gave the recommended fluid bolus (30 mL/kg) and internal medicine residents had a higher percentage of correct answer than surgical residents (28.6 % vs.7.32 %, P = 0.01). One hundred and fifteen (85 %) residents and 123 (90 %) residents used appropriate target mean arterial pressure and vasopressors, respectively. Most residents could give antimicrobial agents (73.5 %) and steroid (93.4 %) appropriately in patients with sepsis and septic shock. However, only half of the residents knew the target range of blood sugar control in sepsis patients, and internal medicine residents have a better knowledge than the other residents
