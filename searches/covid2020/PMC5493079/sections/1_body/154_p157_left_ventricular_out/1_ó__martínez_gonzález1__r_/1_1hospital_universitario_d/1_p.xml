 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Ultrasound is a non invasive and bedside accessible method of cardiac function monitoring. Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocity time integral (VTI) can be measured in most critical care patient and is an useful tool for this purpose. Calculations of cardiac output needing aortic valve area are strongly dependent on skills and observers. We hypothesize that LVOT-VTI is an accurate estimation of stroke volume index (SVI). The objective of the study was to assess the correlation between SVI and LVOT-VTI.
