 <bold>Results:</bold> One hundred and two paired measurements were recorded in thirty two patients. One patient was excluded from the study due to the difficulty to obtain an adequate acoustic window. Twenty one patients were monitorized by PiCCO and eleven by PAC. The Pearson correlation index between LVOT-VTI en SVI was r = 0,770 (p &lt; 0,001). This correlations was similar for measurements taken by PiCCO (r = 0,736, p &lt; 0,001) but worsened when PAC was used to calculate SVI (r = 0,470, p = 0,004). Correlation was acceptable for patients on atrial fibrillation (r = 0,619, p &lt; 0,001).
