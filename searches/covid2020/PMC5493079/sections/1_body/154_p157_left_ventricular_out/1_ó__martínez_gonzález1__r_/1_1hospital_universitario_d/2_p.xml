 <bold>Methods:</bold> Three ICU from different university hospitals participated in the study. Consecutive patients with haemodynamic monitoring on mechanical ventilation were included. Patient with aortic valve regurgitation or dynamic stenosis on the LVOT were excluded from the study. LVOT-VTI was measured by pulsatile doppler echocardiography. Five measurements of LVOT-VTI were obtained on each patient. Mean and maximum values were recorded. Simultaneously, five measurement of SVI by floating pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) or Pulse Induced Contour Cardiac Output (PiCCO) thermodilution methods were obtained and the mean was recorded. Mean and maximum LVOT-VTI were correlated with mean invasive SVI. Statistical analysis: correlation was assessed by Pearson correlation index and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
