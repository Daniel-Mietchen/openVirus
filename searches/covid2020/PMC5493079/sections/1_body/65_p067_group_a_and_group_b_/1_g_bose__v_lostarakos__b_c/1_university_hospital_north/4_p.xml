 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Both Group A and Group B streptococcal infections were associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The APACHE 2 score appeared to predict the mortality reliably in patients with Group A Streptococcal infections. In patients with Group B Streptococcal infections however observed mortality was significantly higher than the predicted mortality from the APACHE 2 score. ICU and hospital length of stay were broadly comparable for those of the general ICU population over that period (means 216 and 648Â hours respectively).
