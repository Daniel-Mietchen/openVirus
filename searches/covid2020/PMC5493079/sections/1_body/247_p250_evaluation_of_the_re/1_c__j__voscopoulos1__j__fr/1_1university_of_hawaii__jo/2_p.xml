 <bold>Methods:</bold> RVM data (ExSpiron, Respiratory Motion Inc., Waltham MA) were collected from 153 patients in 3 groups: Group 1, 54 patients, age:65.2 ± 12.1 yrs, BMI:31.2 ± 6.3 kg/m2, surgery with GA; Group 2, 60 patients, 68.9 ± 9.0 yrs, 30.5 ± 5.8 kg/m2, surgery with SA; Group 3, 39 volunteers, 48.5 ± 13.8 yrs, 27.9 ± 8.6 kg/m2, coached to breathe at varied RRs. Groups 1&amp;2 EtCO2 data were collected via ventilator (Draeger Apollo), with an ET tube in Group 1 &amp; sampling nasal cannula in Group 2. Group 3 EtCO2 data were collected via capnograph (Capnostream20, Covidien) with nasal cannula. Deming regression quantified the relationship between EtCO2&amp;MV. EtCO2 sensitivity&amp;mean EtCO2 were compared across cohorts by un-paired t-tests.
