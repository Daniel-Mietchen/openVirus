 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Capnography (EtCO2) is unreliable for monitoring respiratory status in non-intubated patients. We used a noninvasive respiratory volume monitor (RVM), which provides accurate measurements of minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume &amp; respiratory rate (RR) in non-intubated patients, to compare the relationship between EtCO2 &amp; MV in intubated patients with general anesthesia (GA), non-intubated patients with spinal anesthesia (SA) &amp; awake volunteers.
