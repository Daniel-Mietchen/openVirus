 <bold>Results:</bold> The EtCO2 sensitivity was significantly higher in intubated patients vs volunteers (-83.5° ± 9.7°vs-30.1° ± 16.1°, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig64" ref-type="fig">64a</xref>). In non-intubated patients the sensitivity was not normally distributed &amp; spanned the range of intubated patients &amp; volunteers. Measured EtCO2 values were higher in Group1 than Groups 2&amp;3 (37.2 ± 4.4 mmHg vs 23.0 ± 5.2 mmHg vs 31.0 ± 4.0 mmHg, respectively, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig64" ref-type="fig">64b</xref>). EtCO2 measurements were normally distributed in all groups.
