<p id="Par2777">Initial ROSC rates were 10 of 14 animals in the dantrolene group vs. 5 of 14 animals in the amiodarone group (3 of 10 for saline group). However, persistence of ROSC until 120Â min follow-up was shown in 6 animals of the dantrolene group, 4 animals in the amiodarone group and 2 animals of the saline (sham) group. However, results were not statistically significant between groups. Hemodynamic data and cerebral perfusion as well as cerebral oximetry were comparable between survivor animals.</p>
