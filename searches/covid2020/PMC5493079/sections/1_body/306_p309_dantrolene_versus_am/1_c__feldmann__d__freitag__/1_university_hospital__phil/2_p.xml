<p id="Par2773">Dantrolene is a therapeutic drug for patients with malignant hyperthermia. Interestingly, dantrolene has antiarrhythmic characteristics and might be an alternative for patients with VTs (ventricular tachycardia) or VF (ventricular fibrillation). However, experimental resuscitation studies comparing dantrolene and amiodarone are still missing. Aim of this study was to evaluate ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation) rates for dantrolene versus amiodarone in a pig model of sustained cardiac arrest (8Â min) under VF.</p>
