<p id="Par2775">Ventricular fibrillation was induced in anesthetized pigs (dantrolene, n = 14 and amiodarone, n = 14 or saline, n = 10). After 8 min of untreated VF, chest compressions and ventilation were started and one of the drugs (amiodarone 5 mg kg -1, dantrolene 2.5 mg kg -1 or saline (sham)) was applied in a blinded fashion. After 4 min of CPR without epinephrine or other drugs, defibrillation with 200 J was performed. Standardized resuscitation including mechanical cpr and defibrillation according to protocol was applied in all animals. ROSC rates and cardiovascular as well as blood gas analysis and cerebral oximetry and perfusion measurements were calculated during the experiments.</p>
