 <bold>Results:</bold> For sepsis patients at the ICU we found that median H3 levels were significantly increased in non-survivors as compared to survivors with levels found being 3.15 μ g/ml versus 0.57 μg/ml respectively, P = 0.04. H3 levels are positively correlated with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (Spearman’s rho = 0.49, P &lt; 0.001), and negatively correlated with antithrombin levels (rho = -0.34, P = 0.027) and platelet counts (rho = -0.33, P = 0.031).
