 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Extracellular histones are cytotoxic compounds capable of mediating death in murine sepsis. Furthermore, circulating nucleosome levels predict mortality in human inflammation and sepsis. Whether or not extracellular histone H3 correlates with other plasma parameters and/or ICU scoring systems has not been completely established, nor if levels of circulating extracellular histones can be used as predictive markers for clinical outcome in sepsis.
