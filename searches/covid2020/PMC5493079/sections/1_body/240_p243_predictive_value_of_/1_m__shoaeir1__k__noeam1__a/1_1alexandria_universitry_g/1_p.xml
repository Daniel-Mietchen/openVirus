 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Optimal time to wean from mechanical ventilation (MV) remains a challenge in most critically ill patients [1]. There have been studies looking at the factors that aid weaning from MV, however the results have been variable. Recent evidence suggests lung ultrasound (LUS) can predict successful weaning from MV [2]. This study assesses the ability of the lung aeration scoring [3] using LUS to predict successful weaning in critically ill patients.
