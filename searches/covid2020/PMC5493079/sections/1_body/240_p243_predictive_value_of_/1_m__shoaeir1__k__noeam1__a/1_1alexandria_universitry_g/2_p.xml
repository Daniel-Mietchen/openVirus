 <bold>Methods:</bold> This prospective, observational and non-interventional study was performed in a general ICU in a large university hospital over a period of 6 months. We included all patients who needed MV for &gt; 48 hours (n = 50), and were eligible for Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT). LUS was performed during SBT and lung aeration scoring was calculated in 12 lung regions. Points were allocated according to the worst ultrasound pattern observed: N (normal lung pattern) = 0, B1 lines ( multiple well-defined B lines) =1, B2 lines (multiple coalescent B lines) = 2, c (consolidation or atelectasis) = 3.
