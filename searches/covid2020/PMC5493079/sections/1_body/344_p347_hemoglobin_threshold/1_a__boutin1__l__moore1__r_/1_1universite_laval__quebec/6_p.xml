<p id="Par3153">We included 215 patients (78 % male; mean age: 45 years). A third of patients were transfused over their ICU stay (n = 66)). The median pre-transfusion hemoglobin levels in patients who were transfused were 81 g/L (IQR 67 to 100); and 110 g/L (IQR 93 to 123) in patients who did not receive red blood cells. Worse outcomes were significantly more frequent in patients who were transfused in adjusted models (mortality RR: 2.25 [95%CI 1.41 to 3.59]; neurological complications RR: 3.45 [1.43 to 8.32]; trauma complications RR: 1.64 [1.29 to 2.07]; ICU LOS geometrical ratio: 1.99 [1.45 to 2.73]; hospital LOS geometrical mean ratio: 2.38 [1.51 to 3.75]). A non-statistically significant trend toward higher risk ratios for unfavorable outcomes following transfusions in strata of patients with higher hemoglobin levels was observed. No significant modification of transfusion effect by age, presence of comorbidities, or traumatic brain injury severity was observed.</p>
