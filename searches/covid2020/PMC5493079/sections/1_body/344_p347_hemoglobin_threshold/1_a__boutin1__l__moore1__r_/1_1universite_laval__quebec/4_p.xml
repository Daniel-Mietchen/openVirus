<p id="Par3151">We conducted a cohort study of patients with moderate/severe traumatic brain injury admitted to the ICU of a level I trauma center (Halifax). Data related to pre-transfusion hemoglobin levels and red blood cells were collected. The association between hemoglobin level, red blood cell transfusion and mortality was evaluated using a robust Poisson model. We also constructed proportional hazard models with time-dependant variables (hemoglobin and transfusion) to evaluate survival. Neurological and non-neurological trauma complications as well as length of stay (LOS) in ICU or hospital were considered as secondary outcomes.</p>
