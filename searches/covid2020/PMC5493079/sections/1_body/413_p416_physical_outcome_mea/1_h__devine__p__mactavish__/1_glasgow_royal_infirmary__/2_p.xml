 <bold>Methods:</bold> Discharged ICU patients attended a five week multidisciplinary programme. Patientsâ€™ physical function was assessed during the programme, at 6 months and 12 months post discharge. Three outcome measures were included in the initial two cohorts. The Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and the Incremental Shuttle Walk test (ISWT) were chosen as they have been used within the critical care follow up setting (2). The Chester Step Test (CST) is widely thought to be a good indicator of ability to return to work (one of the programmes primary aims). Ethics approval was waived as the programme was part of a quality improvement initiative.
