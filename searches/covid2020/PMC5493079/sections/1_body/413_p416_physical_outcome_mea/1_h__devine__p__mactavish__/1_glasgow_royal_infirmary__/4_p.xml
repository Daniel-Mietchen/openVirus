 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Exercise capacity measurement is not achievable for some patients with either the ISWT or the CST due to the severity of their physical debilitation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression are common psychological problems post discharge (4), therefore using a test with a bleep is not appropriate. Therefore, the 6MWT is the most appropriate physical outcome measure to be used with critical care patients post discharge.
