 <bold>Results:</bold> Data was collected for the initial patients attending the programme (n = 13), median age was 52 (IQR = 38-72), median ICU LOS was 19 days (IQR = 4-91), median APACHE II was 23 (IQR = 19-41) and 11 were men. One patient was so physically debilitated that the CST or ISWT could not be completed however a score was achieved using the 6MWT. Another patient almost failed to achieve level 1 of the ISWT. Subsequent patients for this project (total n = 47) have all therefore been tested using the 6MWT. Good inter-rater and intra-rater reliability and validity have been reported for the 6MWT (3).
