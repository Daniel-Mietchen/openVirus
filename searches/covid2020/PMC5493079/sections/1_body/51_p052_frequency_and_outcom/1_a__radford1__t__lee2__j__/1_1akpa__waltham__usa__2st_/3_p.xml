 <bold>Results:</bold> Of 1,397 ICU admissions 517 had sepsis and of these, 373 (27 % of ICU admissions, 72 % of septic patients) had at least 1 INR and platelet count at any point from day 1 to 3 of ICU admission. 20 to 35 % of septic patients met various criteria for SAC. Presence of SAC at 12 hours or at 24 hours was associated with significantly increased mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.3 &amp; 1.94 at 12 and 24 hrs respectively) and need for vasopressors (OR = 4.6 &amp; 6.4), ventilation (OR = 1.68 &amp; 2.13) and RRT (OR = 1.71 &amp; 2.94) in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Increasing severity of the combination of abnormal INR and platelets was associated with significantly higher mortality and greater need for vasopressors and RRT but not ventilation. Increasingly abnormal INR was associated with increasing mortality in a monotonic, increasing fashion whereas only severe thrombocytopenia (platelets (&lt;80,000) was associated with significantly increased mortality.
