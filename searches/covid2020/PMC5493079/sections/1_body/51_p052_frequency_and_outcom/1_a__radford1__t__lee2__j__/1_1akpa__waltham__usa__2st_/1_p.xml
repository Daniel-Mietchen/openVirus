 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The frequency of early (within the first three days of onset) sepsis-associated coagulopathy (SAC) and its association with clinical outcomes varies depending on the definition(s) of coagulopathy. Furthermore, the frequency of SAC may have decreased with more effective use of sepsis bundles (early antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors). Accordingly, we sought to determine the frequency and outcome of early SAC.
