 <bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed all patients admitted to the medical-surgical ICU of St. Paul’s Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Vancouver, Canada from January 2011 to July 2013. We included patients who met SAC inclusion criteria: sepsis and platelet count less than 150,000 (or a decrease of at least 30 %) and INR greater than 1.2 within the first three days of onset of sepsis. We assessed the presence and severity of SAC and the association of SAC with hospital mortality and need for vasopressors, ventilation and renal replacement therapy (RRT).
