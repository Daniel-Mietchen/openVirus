 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> SAC is common (20 – 35 % of septic patients) and is associated with increased mortality and need for vasopressors, ventilation and renal replacement therapy. Accordingly, there is a need for therapies that decrease the severity of SAC to attempt to decrease mortality and organ dysfunction in sepsis.
