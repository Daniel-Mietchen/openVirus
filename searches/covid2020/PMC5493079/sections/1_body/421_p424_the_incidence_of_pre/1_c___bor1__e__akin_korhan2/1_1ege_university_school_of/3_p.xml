 <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 194 patients were examined in the study, 30 (15,4 %) of them developed a PU. The factors associated with PU development were: serum albumin level (p =0,0004), generalized edema (p = 0,004), mechanical ventilation use (p = 0,0007), sedation (p = 0,01) and GCS (p = 0.00001). Age, gender, body mass index, APACHE II and SOFA scores, and repositioning were not different between patients with and without PU.
