 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Clinical studies have shown that the reduction of toxic levels of cytokines from blood with the use of a new sorbent, CytoSorb (CytoSorbents), could be useful to regain control during a complicated inflammatory condition in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock [1]. In this case series, we evaluated patients admitted to our ICU from Jan. to Nov. 2015 treated with CytoSorb. The aim was to analyse its influence in clinical outcomes, as mean arterial pressure (MAP), vasopressors need and inflammatory markers, like procalcitonin (PCT).
