 <bold>Methods:</bold> We included 8 patients (4 f, 4 m): 2 severe sepsis and 6 septic shock. Patients’ data are reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab24" ref-type="table">24</xref> as median (lower and upper quartiles). All patients were non-responding to the Standard of Care for the treatment of severe sepsis/septic shock. Therefore, CytoSorb was used as adjunctive therapy in combination with continuous renal replace therapy (CRRT), in order to control the cytokines storm and improve the hemodynamic stability. It was installed in series connection after the dialyser in the CRRT circuit for 24 h (median duration of the treatment: 48 h). Clinical parameters were collected before and after every treatment with CytoSorb.
