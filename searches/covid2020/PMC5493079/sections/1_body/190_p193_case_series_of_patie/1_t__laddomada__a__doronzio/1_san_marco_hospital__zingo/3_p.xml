 <bold>Results:</bold> 6 treated patients survived and during the treatment there was an overall improvement of MAP from 83 (73,5-89) to 88 (82-89,5) mmHg, with a rapid reduction in vasopressors dosages: noradrenaline decreased from 0,33 (0,15-0,46) to 0,13 (0,10-0,18) while dopamine from 7,5 (6-8) to 3 (1,5-5) Y/kg/min. Moreover, there was a markedly decrease of PCT levels from 14,53 (7,64-67,5) to 3,90 (1,62-23,05) ng/dl and an improvement in renal function, thanks to the combination of CytoSorb with CRRT. In non-survivors, MAP was hard to stabilize and decreased from 89,5 (77,75-101,25) to 69,5 (63,25-73,75) mmHg and there was an aggravation in overall patientsâ€™ conditions.
