 <bold>Results:</bold> Patients with thrombosis showed statistically significant elevated proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, p &lt; 0.01, IL-6, p &lt; 0.05) and lower anti-inflammatory IL-10 release (p &lt; 0.05) on admission, compared to those without thrombosis. IL-8 admission levels, had no difference between groups (p &gt; 0.05), due to later expression. There were no significant differences between age and hospitalization days in both groups. Thrombosis found to be correlated with poor outcome (p &lt; 0.05).
