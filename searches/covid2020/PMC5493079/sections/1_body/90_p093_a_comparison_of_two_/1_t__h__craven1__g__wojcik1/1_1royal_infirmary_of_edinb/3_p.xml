 <bold>Results:</bold> 266 patients were ventilated for more than two days. The HVAP and PVAP rates per 1000 at risk ventilation days (total diagnoses) were 5.0 (10) and 2.0 (4) respectively. Concordance between diagnoses was poor (Cohen’s Kappa -0.02 (95 % CI: -0.04 to -0.01)). HVAP was statistically associated with longer stay and ventilation, in contrast to PVAP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>). Neither were associated with mortality (HVAP p = 0.22 and PVAP p = 0.13).
