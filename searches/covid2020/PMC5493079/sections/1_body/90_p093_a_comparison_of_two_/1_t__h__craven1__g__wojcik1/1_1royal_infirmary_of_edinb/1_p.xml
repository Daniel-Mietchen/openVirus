 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) rates are a key quality metric and the subjectivity of surveillance has been criticized. The CDC introduced an objective algorithm to diagnose Possible VAP (PVAP) [1]. Local practice uses HELICS methodology to diagnose HVAP. We present preliminary results from a comparison of the techniques, funded by Health Protection Scotland.
