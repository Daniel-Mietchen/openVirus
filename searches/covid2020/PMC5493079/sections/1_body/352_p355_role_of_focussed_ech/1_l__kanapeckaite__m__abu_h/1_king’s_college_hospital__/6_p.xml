<p id="Par3233">In patients with syncope, echocardiography is an imaging modality with high sensitivity and specificity for clinically significant structural disease [3]. Current guidelines only recommend formal echocardiographic evaluation in patients with clinically suspected structural cardiac disease [3]. Clinical assessment tools including composite risk scores have repeatedly been demonstrated to be poor at identifying structural heart disease [3]. Syncopal events in such context are associated with significant increase in mortality [1-3]. Studies have demonstrated that emergency physicians can attain a high level of proficiency in echocardiography allowing diagnostic evaluation of complex systolic and diastolic dysfunction and in operators with &gt; 250 examinations, accurate identification of structural disease [3]. Focused-echocardiography can be safely integrated into the clinical assessment process in the presence of an experienced operator and yields findings superior to clinical assessment alone [3].</p>
