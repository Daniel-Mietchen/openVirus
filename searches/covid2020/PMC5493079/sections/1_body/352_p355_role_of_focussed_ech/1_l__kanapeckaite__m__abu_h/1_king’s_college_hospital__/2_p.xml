<p id="Par3229">Syncope remains a common Emergency Department (ED) presentation [1]. Almost 50 % of syncope cases are likely caused by a reflex response with excellent prognosis [1,2]. Unfortunately, up to 33 % of patients with syncope will be discharged with no clear diagnosis and are known to have an elevated risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiac causes [1-3]. We set out to develop a focused-echocardiography based algorithm to risk stratify this patient group.</p>
