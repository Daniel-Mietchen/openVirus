 <bold>Results:</bold> It is noted that phenylpropionic acid (PPA) disappeared in critical ill patients while always present in healthy. Levels of PLA, p-HPLA and p-HPAA were significantly higher in critically ill patients of both ICUs versus donors (p &lt; 0,05). A positive correlation with total serum levels of the 3 PhCAs and APACHE II were found (rM-ICU = 0.7 and rS-ICU = 0,8, p &lt; 0.001). PLA and p-HPLA was significantly higher in patients with arterial hypotension (MAP &lt; 70 mm). Mortality was 31 % in ICUs. The total 3PhCAs serum level in died (n = 45) was higher 6 times versus surviving (n = 102), p &lt; 0,001. Area under the prognostic ROC curve for APACHE II scale was 0,9 (p &lt; 0,001), for ∑ 3PhCAs 0,9 (p &lt; 0,001), this confirms the high predictive value of ∑ 3PhCAs.
