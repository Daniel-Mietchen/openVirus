 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Previously it was found in blood of septic patients a high level of three phenylcarboxylic acids (PhCAs) - phenyllactic (PLA), p-hydroxyphenyllactic (p-HPLA), p-hydroxyphenylacetic (p-HPAA). These metabolites of aromatic acids have predominately microbial origin in human body [1]. Experimentally demonstrated that PhCAs affect the function of mitochondria [2]. It was shown prognostic value of PhCAs at ICU admission [3]. In this study, we investigated in different ICUs the relationship of disbalance of PhCAs with severity and mortality.
