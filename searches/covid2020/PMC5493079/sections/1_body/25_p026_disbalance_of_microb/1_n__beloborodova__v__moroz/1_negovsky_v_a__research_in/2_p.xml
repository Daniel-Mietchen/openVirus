Patients from mixed ICU (M-ICU), n = 89, APACHE II 12 [8-16] were with documented infection of various localization, average age 58 (47-65) years. Patients from surgical ICU (S-ICU), n = 58, APACHE II 8 [5-16]) were with intestine perforation (n = 35) and intestinal obstruction (n = 23) after emergency surgery, the average age 64 (52-78) years. Serum levels of PhCAs were measured using Gas-chromatography. Healthy adult donors (n = 72) were used as a control [4].
