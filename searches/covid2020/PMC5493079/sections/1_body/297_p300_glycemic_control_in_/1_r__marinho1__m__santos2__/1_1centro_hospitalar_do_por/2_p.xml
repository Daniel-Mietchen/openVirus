<p id="Par2681">Target levels of glycemia in critically ill patients have fluctuated since 2001, as evidence initially indicated that tight glycemic control (80-110 mg/dl) leaded to the lowest morbidity and mortality, however subsequent studies have demonstrated minimal clinical benefit combined with greater morbidity and mortality, so nowadays the target glucose level approaches 150-180 mg/DL. The aim of this study was to assess glucose control in critically ill patients in Portuguese ICUs and evaluate the incidence of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.</p>
