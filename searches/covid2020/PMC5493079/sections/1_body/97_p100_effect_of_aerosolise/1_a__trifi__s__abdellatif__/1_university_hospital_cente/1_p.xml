 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to multidrug-resistant (MDR), gram-negative bacteria (GNB) is responsible for a prolongation of ventilation days. Several recent studies focused in Aerosolized polymyxin emphasize the potential benefit of this modality. Indeed, by increasing bactericidal activity in situ, this modality led to faster resolution of clinical signs, and perhaps, accelerated weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV). The purpose was to determine whether aerosolized colistin (AS) would accelerate weaning from MV in VAP due to MDR GNB.
