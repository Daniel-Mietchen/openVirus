 <bold>Methods:</bold> 20 adult pts in ICU for SS. All pts were monitored with CPCCO Pulsion Medical Systems and serial TEE have been performed. The cardiac output(CO;L/min) was measured continuously with the method CPCCO(triple injection of 15 ml of 0.9 % saline solution at 4 °C in the CVC, thermo dilution curve measured in the femoral artery through the catheter thermistor dedicated) and simultaneously with TEE(LVOT area multiplied the integral speed/time of aortic flow multiplied by the heart rate) at the entrance, after fluid challenge with 500 ml of crystalloid and during the use of vasopressors and/or inotropic drug(VId). Same operator measured echocardiographic CO without being aware of the CO supplied by CPCCO. The results were expressed as mean with standard deviation. For comparison and correlation between measurements were used linear regressions according to the Bland-Altman method. Statistical significance was considered at p ≤ 0.05.
