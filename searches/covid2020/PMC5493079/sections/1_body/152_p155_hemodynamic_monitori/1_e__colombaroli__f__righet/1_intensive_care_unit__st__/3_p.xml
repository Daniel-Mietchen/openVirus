 <bold>Results:</bold> 120 measurements were performed. 60 with CPCCO and 60 with the TEE. 40 measurements were realized at the entrance, 20 with CPCCO(1.8 ± 0.2) and 20 with TEE(1.75 ± 0.3), 40 after fluid challenge, 20 with CPCCO(2.5 ± 0.3) and 20 with TEE(2.7 ± 0.2), 40 during the use of vasopressors and/or inotropic drug including 20 with CPCCO(4.5 ± 0.3) and 20 with TEE(4.4 ± 0.2). There is a good correlation and a limited bias between measurements provided by CPCCO and by TEE, both at the entrance(r = 0.992,bias = 0.15), after fluid challenge (r = 0.954,bias = 0.24), both during the use of VId (r = 0.967,bias = 0.33). These values were statistically significant (p = 0.026).
