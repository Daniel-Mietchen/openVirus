 <bold>Methods:</bold> Existing guidelines are intended to limit excessive testing in stable patients. We audited adherence to these and also recorded trends in haematocrit and haemoglobin to identify cases of iatrogenic anaemia on the unit. In order to establish trends and to exclude stable post surgical patients, we limited eligible patients to those who were on the unit for 3 days or more. On six randomly assigned days over a 2 month period, all eligible patients on the unit had a proforma filled retrospectively for all days up until their admission to the unit, or up to seven days previously, whichever sooner. Presence of arterial or central access was also noted, as these facilitate obtaining samples.
