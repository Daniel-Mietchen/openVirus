 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Stopping short of suggesting an opt in approach to lab tests as other units have done
 <sup>2</sup>, we are recommending a period of education for existing nursing and medical staff, and also new trainees on the Intensive Care Unit. We are also recommending removal or alteration of the “Critical Care” test set that is currently available from our electronic requesting system in the hope that it will encourage more critical thinking about which tests are appropriate for the patient they are caring for.
