 <bold>Results:</bold> We obtained 101 patient days worth of data across 20 patients who were considered eligible. Our results demonstrated that 54% of tests done were required but more importantly, 46% of tests carried out were deemed clinically unnecessary by a panel of three ICU physicians, and 48% were ordered despite the unit guidelines stating otherwise. The inpatient cost of carrying out the unnecessary blood tests added up to Â£842 and the amount of blood wasted totalled 1052 ml. Based on these figures, the average volume of unnecessary blood taken from a patient per week is 73 ml. Only 2 patients selected had no central or arterial line for part of their inspected days, and this had no effect as they had tests taken daily anyway.
