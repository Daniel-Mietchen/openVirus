 <xref rid="Fig30" ref-type="fig">30</xref> shows calculation of M1 (overall alarm duration reduction = 31 %) and M2 (artifact alarm duration reduction = 94 %) The number of artifact alarms in the complete data set is estimated from artifact prevalence in the annotated sample. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig31" ref-type="fig">31</xref> is the ROC diagram for ML algorithm for both short and long alarms. The vertical line indicates proportion of artifact alarms correctly identified at a false negative rate of 30 % (i.e. % of real alerts incorrectly filtered out).
