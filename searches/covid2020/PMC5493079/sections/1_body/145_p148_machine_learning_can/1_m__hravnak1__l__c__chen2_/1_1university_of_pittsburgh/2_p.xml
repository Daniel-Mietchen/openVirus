 <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients had VS monitoring data (heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR], oximetry [SpO2]) recorded at 1/20Hz. We partitioned data into training/validation (294 admissions; 22,980 hrs) and test sets (2,057 admissions; 156,177 hrs). Alarms are VS deviations beyond stability thresholds, and annotated as real alerts or artifact. We trained a random forest ML algorithm to discriminate alerts from artifact for long alarms (&gt;3 min) and evaluated performance in the test set on both long and short alarms (&lt;3 min) according to how many artifact alarms can be reduced among the total number of alarms (M1); and how many artifact alarms can be correctly filtered from the total artifact alarms (M2).
