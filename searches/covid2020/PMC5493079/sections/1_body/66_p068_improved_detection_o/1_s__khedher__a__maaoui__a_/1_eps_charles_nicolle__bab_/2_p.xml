 <bold>Methods:</bold> Our study included 44 patients with cirrhosis and tense ascites. Immediately, after paracentesis a urine test strips was performed searching visually the presence of leukocytes and nitrites on the ascitic fluid. The reaction between this fluid and the strip induced a color change. The color of the leukocyte reagent area was then compared with the color chart of the bottle and the result was scored in function of the number of crosses. Besides biochemical and bacteriological analysis of the ascitic fluid was done including bedside inoculation of five millimeters of this fluid into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles. Cultures of blood were also obtained from all patients.
