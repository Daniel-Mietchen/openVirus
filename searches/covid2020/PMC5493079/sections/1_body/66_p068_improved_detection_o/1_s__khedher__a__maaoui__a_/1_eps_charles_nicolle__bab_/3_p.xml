 <bold>Results:</bold> SBP was diagnosed in 11 of the 44 samples. URITOP + TM test was positive in 8 cases. The reading of leukocytes strips revealed one cross, two crosses and three crosses in 15,4 %, 30,8 % and 15,4 % respectively. Nitrites were present in 69,5 % of cases. Blood and ascitic inoculation were positive in 46,2 % and 53,8 % respectively. The major bacteria isolated were gram-negative bacilli. We found a significant correlation between SBP and visual detection of white cells and nitrites (p &lt; 10-3 for both parameters). A significant correlation was also found between SBP and both ascitic (p = 0,02) and blood (p = 0,006) inoculation. Both visual detection of leukocytes and asitic inoculation in blood culture bottles had a sensibility and a specificity of 100 %.
