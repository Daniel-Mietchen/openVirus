 <bold>Methods:</bold> This was a prospective observational study of all adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who were admitted to the ICU between 01/10/2013 and 30/04/2014. Using Micromedex as the reference, the doses of administered intravenous antibiotics on the first ICU day were compared to the recommended doses and were classified as under-dosed, over-dosed or appropriate. We excluded antibiotics which usually does not need dose adjustment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of antibiotic dosing error (under- or over-dosing). Age, gender, height, weight, chronic cardiovascular and renal diseases, estimated glomerular filtration rate and presence of shock were the independent variables.
