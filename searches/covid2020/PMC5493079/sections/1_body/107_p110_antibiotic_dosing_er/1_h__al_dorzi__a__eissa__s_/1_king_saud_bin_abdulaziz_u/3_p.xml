 <bold>Results:</bold> During the study period, 189 patients had severe sepsis (62 %) or septic shock (38 %). We evaluated 263 antibiotic prescriptions. Most (62 %) patients received appropriate antibiotic doses. However, 39 (21 %) patients were under-dosed, 30 (16 %) were over-dosed, and 3 (2 %) had combination of over-dosing and under-dosing. Septic patients with chronic cardiovascular disease (p = 0.035) and chronic renal failure (p = 0.021) were more likely to have antibiotic dosing errors. However, respiratory failure, liver failure, immunodeficiency state and diabetes mellitus were not clearly associated with dposing errors. Vancomycin was associated with the highest dosing error rate (43 %). The other antibiotics (pipercillin/tazobactam, meropenem, imipenem, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, colistin and gentamicin) were dosed appropriately in &gt;70 % of prescriptions. The multivariate analysis showed that the estimated glomerular filtration rate was the only variable associated with dosing error (odds ratio, 0.98 per 1 ml/min increment; 95 % confidence interval, 0.97-0.99).
