 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Antibiotic dosing errors, which include under- and over-dosing, were common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Vancomycin had the highest rate of inappropriate dosing. Lower glomerular filtration rate was a significant predictor of dosing error and should be routinely considered for antibiotic dosing.
