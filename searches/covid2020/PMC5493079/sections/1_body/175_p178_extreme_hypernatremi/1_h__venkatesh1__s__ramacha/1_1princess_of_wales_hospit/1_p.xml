 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Approximately 1 to 2 % of patients attending the Emergency Department have hypernatremia(1). Hypernatremia over 160 mmol/L is considered to be very severe and as such needs to be treated with caution(2). Extreme cases of hypernatraemia are rare (where sodium levels are exceptionally high), especially in adults and the most common pathophysiology in such cases would be related to severe dehydration. We see this more in the elderly population, children, the institutionalised and patients with dementia.
