 <bold>Results:</bold> The hypernatraemia was thought to be caused by chronic severe dehydration from poor intake and the sepsis was thought to have started as an inadequately treated urinary tract infection. The patient was initially treated aggressively with hypotonic saline and intravenous antibiotics, but was subsequently managed using a slower correction rate after identifying the chronic nature of the natremia. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of extreme hypernatremia and severe sepsis manifesting concomitantly in such a young patient.
