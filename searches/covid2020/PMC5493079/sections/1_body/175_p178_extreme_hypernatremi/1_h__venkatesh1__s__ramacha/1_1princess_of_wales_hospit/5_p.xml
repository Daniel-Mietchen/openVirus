<p id="Par1930">We advocate early identification of chronic hypernatremia and effective administration of intravenous fluids in the Emergency Department that is decided on a case-by-case basis. In cases of severe and extreme hypernatraemia in particular, accurate calculation of free water deficit is essential to manage the patient effectively. In line with this, we must ensure that such patients are always weighed on admission.</p>
