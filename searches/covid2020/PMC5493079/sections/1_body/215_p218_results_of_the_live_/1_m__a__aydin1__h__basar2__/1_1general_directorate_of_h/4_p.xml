 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In recent years, there is a significant increase in live-kidney transplantations in our country, due to inadequte obtaining of organ from cadaver. We observed a quite high patient and graft survival times and a low chronic rejection incidence in our live-kidney transplantation patients. Although there is a high life quality and better graft function in live-kidney transplantations compared to cadaver-kidney transplantations, cadaver-kidney transplantations should be increased.
