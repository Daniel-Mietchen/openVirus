 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Although there are differences in criteria of live-kidney transplantation in organ transplantation programmes in the World, it is still performed widespread. Even though there are developments in tissue matching and immunesupressive protocols, graft loss is still an important problem after live-kidney transplantations because of acute and chronic allograft nephropathy. We aimed to assess the survival rates of patients and grafts after live-kidney transplantation.
