<p id="Par2673">Vary Insulin protocols were applied to control blood glucose(BG) in critical patients, mostly based on short acting insulin, which consumed lots of manpower and resources. By previous study yielded 66.7 % success rate of glycemic control with 80 % dose conversion from short acting insulin dose with mean of differences of 26.5 mg/dL. The aim of this study was to determine whether a single subcutaneous glargine injection with 100 % dose transition is not inferior to the continuous regular insulin (RI) infusion for BG control in critically ill patients (inferior margin acquired from 85 % of the mean of differences from previous study =22.525 mg/dL).</p>
