<p id="Par2677">Of 20 cases included, 12 cases achieved a good glycemic control. Among success subgroup, there were no BG level higher than mean glucose during RI more than 22.525 mg/dl. Only a mild hypoglycemia event was observed with spontaneously resolved. Otherwise among 8 participants in failure subgroup, half of them developed hyperglycemia at 8th hour.
