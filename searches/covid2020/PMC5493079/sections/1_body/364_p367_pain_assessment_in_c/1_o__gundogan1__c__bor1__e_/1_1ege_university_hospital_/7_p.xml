<p id="Par3363">Thirty three of the patients (66 %) was male. The mean age was 57.4 and the mean APACHE II score was 18.7. Glasgow Coma Score was equal or less than 8 in 66 % of all patients. A total of 100 assessments performed by a resident and an intensivist were recorded from 50 patients using the CPOT and the BPS. Scores of the CPOT and the BPS during the painful procedures were both significantly higher than those during the nonpainful procedures. The agreement between CPOT and BPS during painful and nonpainful stimuli was ranged as; sensitivity 66.7 % - 90.3 %; specificity 89.7 % - 97.9 %; kappa value 0.712 - 0.892. The agreement between resident and intensivist during painful and non-painful stimuli was ranged from 97 % to 100 % and the kappa value was between 0.904 - 1.0.</p>
