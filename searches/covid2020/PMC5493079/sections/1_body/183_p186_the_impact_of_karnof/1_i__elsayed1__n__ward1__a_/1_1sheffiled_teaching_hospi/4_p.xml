<p id="Par1978">Adjusting for age and sex, APACHE II was the only factor associated with patient need for RRT at ICU discharge, 28 days, 90 days and 12 months (OR 1.09, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.15, p = 0.003; OR 1.1, 95%CI 1.04-1.16, p = 0.001; OR 1.1, 95%CI 1.04-1.17, p = 0.001 and OR 1.1, 95%CI 1.04-1.17, p = 0.001, respectively). After adjusting for age and sex, admission SOFA (OR 0.88, 95%CI 0.8-0.97, p = 0.008), APACHE II (OR 0.89, 95%CI 0.84-0.95, &lt;0.001) and KPS (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1-1.06, p = 0.049) were associated with ICU survival. However at multivariate regression analysis, only APACHE II was independently associated with ICU survival (OR 0.91, 95%CI 0.85-0.97, p = 0.003).</p>
