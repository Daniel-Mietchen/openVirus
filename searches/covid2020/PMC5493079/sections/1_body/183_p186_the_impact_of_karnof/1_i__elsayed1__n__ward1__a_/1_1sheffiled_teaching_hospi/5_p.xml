 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Disease severity remains the main determinant of outcome in AKI patients receiving RRT on ICU. Despite the apparent relevance of KPS to outcomes on critical care, we could not in this instance show that KPS independently affected renal or patient survival. More studies on larger numbers of patients are required to clarify this issue.
