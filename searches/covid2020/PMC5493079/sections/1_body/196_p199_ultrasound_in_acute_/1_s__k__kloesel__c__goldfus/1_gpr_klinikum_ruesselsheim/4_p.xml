 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We could demonstrate, that absolvents for FARIUS are able to provide US examination to detect and evaluate postrenal obstruction at similar quality like experts. Identification of pathological results had a high sensitifity. However, the variance for the results indicates some amendment. Thereby the treatment of ICU patients with AKI could be more independent from external conditions offering an equal diagnostic quality. Economic interests and human resources could be positive affected also. Further investigations are in planning.
