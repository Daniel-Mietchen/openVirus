 <bold>Introduction:</bold> AKI is characterised by an abrupt loss of kidney function. Due to its worldwide increasing prevalence and mortality, the disease has become an important health care challenge to be treated in intensive care units (ICU)1,2]. AKI causes are numerous,~10 % of cases are postrenal obstruction with urineaccumulation. Ultrasound(US) is the procedure of choice diagnosing this cause of AKI and hence choosing the best therapy. A survey in UK revealed more than 40 % ICUs do not contact a nephrologist within 48 h in AKI. Moreover, not even 40 % of ICUs were provided with a US option for 24 h a day[3]. This is the reason, why we developed FARIUS (focused on acute renal injury with US) a programme for the education of students and physicians in diagnosing obstruction via US in an expert like manner.
