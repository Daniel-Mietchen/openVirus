 <bold>Methods:</bold> FARIUS was approved by the ethic commission and developed as a 4Â h programme for a training in renal US. To validate FARIUS, we compared US results of 22 trainees (15 students, 7 physicians) with those of 10 experts (2 ICU physician, 3 urologist, 1 nephrologist, 4 internal specialist). We present the results of two quality parameter, i.e.(i) defining the length(cm) of the right kidney of a female volunteer,(ii) diagnosing postrenal obstruction by evaluating images from US examinations. FARIUS participants voted if presented images deveal postrenal obstruction or not. Answers analyzed for correctness, specificity and sensitivity. Statistical analysis (Wilcoxon Test) were realized with INSTANT+.
