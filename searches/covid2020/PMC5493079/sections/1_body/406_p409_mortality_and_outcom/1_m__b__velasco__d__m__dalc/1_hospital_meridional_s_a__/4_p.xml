 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Age did not affect the length stay in ICU and hospital. The elderly subjects (&gt; = 80y) admitted to the ICU had a higher mortality rate compared with subjects of other ages. These findings raise questions about the use of critical care at the end of life for the very elderly.
