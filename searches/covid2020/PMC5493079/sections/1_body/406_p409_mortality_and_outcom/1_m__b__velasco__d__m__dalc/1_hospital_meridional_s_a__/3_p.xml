 <bold>Results:</bold> We had 56.2 % male. The average length of stay in ICU (L80 = 6.5d ± 10.2; G80 = 8.2 ± 10.5) and hospital (L80 = 18.7 ± 35.9; G80 = 23.0 ± 28.7) showed no significant difference between the two groups. Mean SAPS 3 was 41.2 ± 13.3, with differences between the L80 group (38.8 ± 12.5) and G80 (53.0 ± 10.8) as well as the probability of death L80 = 9.8 % ± 13.6 and G80 = 24.8 % ± 17.3, respectively. As might be expected mortality, both in ICU or hospital were higher in the older group with significance according to the Z test for two proportions.
