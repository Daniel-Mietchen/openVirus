 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Prolonged value of prothrombin time/activated partial thromboplastin time (PT/APTT) are often found in patients undergoing surgical procedure. Thromboelastometry as a global test using whole blood might yield different results. The aim of our study was to compare coagulation profile as shown by conventional coagulation tests versus thromboelastometry before surgical procedures and to find out which test better reflects patientâ€™s clinical condition in perioperative period.
