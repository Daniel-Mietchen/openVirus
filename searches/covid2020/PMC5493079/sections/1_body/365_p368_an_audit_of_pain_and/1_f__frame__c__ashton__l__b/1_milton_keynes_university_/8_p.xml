<p id="Par3375">When sedation scores were evaluated utilising the RASS over the same 24 hour period, the mean number of scores documented was n = 6 (ranging from -5 to +2). Of note, 60 % of patients did not have a formal sedation hold, with 66 % having no reason for this documented. In addition, only 46 % of patients had a goal RASS documented on the daily ward round, and of these 39 % met their target RASS.</p>
