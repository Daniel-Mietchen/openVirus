<p id="Par3293">A 21-year-old male with a history of depression was admitted to our hospital emergency department two hours after the voluntary ingestion of a non-quantified amount of barium chloride, which the patient had procured and purchased online as a means for a suicide attempt. The clinical picture consisted of vomiting, diarrhea, and progressive generalized muscle weakness requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, with subsequent ICU admission. Severe hypokalemia was documented (minimum K+ 1.2 mmol/L), complicated by frequent ventricular premature beats with prolonged QT interval (corrected value was 640 ms). Magnesium sulfate and a K+ infusion were administered, but serum K+ remained low. Serum K+ was then 2.2 mmol/L and barium levels were 0.04 mmol/L (toxic range). Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was started. This resulted in a rapid decrease in barium levels and normalization of serum K+. Clinical improvement ensued with the correction of hypokalemia and restored muscular function, allowing spontaneous ventilation and extubation 6 hours later. Barium was persistently undetectable from 12 hours after the beginning of CVVHDF (&lt;0.006 mmol/L). The patient was later transferred to the Psychiatry department, with an uneventful hospital stay.</p>
