<p id="Par3295">There is very limited published data on the use of renal replacement techniques in acute barium intoxication, which is associated with a quicker barium half-life reduction and clinical improvement. A transcellular K+ shift and the barium concentration itself impact muscle weakness, implicating a possible direct effect of barium on either skeletal muscle or neuromuscular transmission. This patient presented with symptoms typical of severe barium intoxication, non-responsive to K+ supplementation. Clinicians in the ICU should remain aware of the potential ingestion of unusual chemicals such as barium chloride in the appropriate clinical context, as the risk of availability through internet purchases may continue to rise in the future. With this unique case we add on to the scanty existing evidence in the literature and strongly advocate the use of dyalisis, targeting both barium removal and the correction of hypokalemia.</p>
