 <bold>Results:</bold> Median age was 65 (48-79) years. Main reasons for ICU admission were postoperative care (26 %), sepsis (22 %), cardiovascular (11 %) and neurological (11 %) complications. Mechanical ventilation was used in 16 % of admitted patients, vasopressors in 13 %, and dialysis in 3 %. ICU and hospital mortality rates were 11 % and 17 %. Mean SAPS 3 score was 44 ± 15 points. Predicted mortality rates were 16 ± 19 % (SAPS 3 SE), 22 ± 23 % (SAPS LA) and 14 ± 14 % (MPM-III). SMRs were 1.00 (95 % CI, 0.98-.102) for the SAPS 3 SE, 0.76 (0.74-0.77) for the SAPS 3 LA and 1.15 (1.13-1.18) for the MPM-III. Discrimination was better for SAPS 3 models (AUROC = 0.85) than for MPM-III (AUROC = 0.80) (p &lt; 0.001). In the calibration belt analyses, the SAPS 3 LA overestimated mortality throughout all risk classes while the MPM-III underestimated it uniformly. The SAPS 3 SE did not show relevant deviations from ideal calibration.
