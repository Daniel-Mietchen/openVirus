 <bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective multicenter cohort study in 48,816 adult patients consecutively admitted to 72 ICUs in 51 hospitals during 2013. We excluded patients who underwent cardiac surgeries or invasive cardiac procedures, readmissions, and those admitted for acute coronary syndromes and burns. We retrieved clinical and outcome data from an electronic ICU quality registry (Epimed Monitor System), including the estimates for the MPM-III and SAPS 3 scores. For the SAPS 3 score, we estimated predicted mortality using both standard (SE) and Latin-American (LA) customized equations. We evaluated modelsâ€™ discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). We applied the calibration belt to evaluate the agreement between observed and expected mortality rates (calibration). We also calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for each model.
