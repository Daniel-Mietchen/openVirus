 <bold>Results:</bold> We enrolled 24 patients (10 men and 14 women). The median (o average) age was 74 years. Baseline characteristics of patientes were: sistolic blood pressure 180 mmhg, diastolic blood pressure 102 mmhg, pO2/FiO2 181, Ph 7,21, pCO2 53 mmhg, lactate 3,4 meq/l. After 30 minutes of CPAP, we noticed in group A patients an improvement of 52 % in pO2/FiO2 ratio, an increase of 0,02 points in pH value, a reduction of 10 % in pCO2, a lactate cleareance of 28 %, in group B an improvement of 120 % in pO2/FiO2 ratio, an increase of 0,13 points in pH value, a reduction of 20%in pCO2, a lactate cleareance of 35 %. No patients required endotracheal intubation. Two patients in A group, after 30 minutes of CPAP, shifted in PSV-NIV because of increase of pCO2.
