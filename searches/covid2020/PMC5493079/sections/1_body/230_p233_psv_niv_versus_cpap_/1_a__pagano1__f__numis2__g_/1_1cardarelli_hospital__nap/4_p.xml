 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The preliminary results of our ongoing trial have shown a better outcome at t30â€² in patients affected by ACPE treated with PSV-NIV compared to those treated with CPAP in lactate clearance, improvement of pO2/FiO2 ratio, pH and pCO2 value. No differences in side effects between two groups were shown.
