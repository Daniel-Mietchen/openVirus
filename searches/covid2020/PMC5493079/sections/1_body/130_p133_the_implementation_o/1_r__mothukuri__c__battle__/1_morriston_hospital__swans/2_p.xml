 <bold>Methods:</bold> All adult trauma patients admitted to the ED (2005 to 2015) were studied, using the data collated for the Trauma Audit and Research Network. Variables included sex, age, Injury Severity score (ISS), PS14 code (injury severity score), injury mechanism, use of Tranexamic acid (TXA), volume of fluids/blood components given at the scene or in the ED, in-hospital mortality hospital and ICU and hospital length of stay. Patients were divided into two groups; patients admitted pre-MHP and patients admitted post-MHP introduction. Differences were analysed using the Fisher Exact test and Mann-Whitney U tests.
