 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Massive haemorrhage is a leading cause of death in major trauma. About one-third of all bleeding trauma patients present with a coagulopathy as a result of physiologic derangements such as acidosis, hypothermia, or haemodilution related to fluid administration.(1) In 2011, Morriston Hospital introduced a Massive Haemorrhage Protocol (MHP) in the Emergency Department (ED). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the MHP.
