 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of this study have demonstrated that a well-defined MHP may contribute to reducing both ICU and hospital length of stay. In the post-MHP group, patients received significantly lower amounts of fluids at the scene and in the ED and there was a significant increase in the use of TXA. A significant increase in the amount of PCC and FFP given to patients in the ED was reported, with no associated increase in blood/plasma reduced cells.
