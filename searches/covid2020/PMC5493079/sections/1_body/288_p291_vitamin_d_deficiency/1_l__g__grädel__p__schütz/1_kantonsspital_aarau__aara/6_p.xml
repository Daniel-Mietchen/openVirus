<p id="Par2611">Of 4257 included patients, 1,510 (35.47 %) had 25(OH)D levels of 25-50 nmol/l (Vitamin D insufficiency) and 797 (18.72 %) had levels &lt;25 nmol/l (severe deficiency). Vitamin D insufficiency and severe deficiency were associated (OR/HR, 95%CI) with an increased risk of 30-day mortality (OR 1.70, 1.22 to 2.36 and 2.70, 1.22 to 2.36) and increased length of stay (HR 0.88, 0.81 to 0.97 and 0.72, 0.65 to 0.81). Severe deficiency was associated with risk of falls (OR 1.77, 1.18 to 2.63), impaired Barthel index (OR 1.80, 1.42 to 2.28) and impairment in of quality of life. Most associations remained robust after multivariate adjustment and in subgroups based on gender, age, comorbidities and main diagnoses (P for interaction &gt;0.05).</p>
