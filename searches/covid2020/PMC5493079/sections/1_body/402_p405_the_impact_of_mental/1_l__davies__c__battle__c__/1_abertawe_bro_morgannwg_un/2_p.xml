 <bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective study design was used in which data was collected on all admissions to the general ICU of a large teaching hospital in South Wales, over a two month period. All adult patients were screened for the following questions; Was the admission a direct consequence of a mental health disorder or recreational/ illicit psychoactive substance use? Is there a co-existing mental health diagnosis present prior to admission? ICD-10 codes were used to define mental health disorders. Outcomes studied included in-hospital mortality, ventilator days and length of ICU stay. Data analysis included Fisher Exact and Mann Whitney U tests. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Ethical approval was waived for this service evaluation.
