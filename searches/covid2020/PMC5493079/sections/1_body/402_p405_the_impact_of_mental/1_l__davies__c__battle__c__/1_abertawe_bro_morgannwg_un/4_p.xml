 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with mental health problems appear to have worse outcomes than those without. The mortality of those admitted to ICU as a direct consequence of their mental health problems is significantly higher than controls. The reasons for this are unclear and likely multi-factorial. A future multi-centre prospective study is planned in Wales to investigate the national impact of mental health disorders on ICU resources.
