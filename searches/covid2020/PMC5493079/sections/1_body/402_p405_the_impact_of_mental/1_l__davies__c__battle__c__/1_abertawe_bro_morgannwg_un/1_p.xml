 <bold>Introduction:</bold> South Wales is an area of relative socio-economic deprivation, with a myriad of well-recognised associated mental health problems. Patients with mental health disorders are commonly admitted to an ICU as a direct consequence of their illness, such as a suicide attempt, or due to indirect consequences, such as an intravenous drug overdose in drug addicts. As a result of these findings we set out to ascertain the effect of pre-existing mental health issues including addiction on ICU admission.
