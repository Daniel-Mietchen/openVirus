 <bold>Results:</bold> The in vitro clearance was significantly higher for EMiC2 as compared to AV1000S (5.00 vs. 0.03 ml/min). In clinical samples, IL-6 concentrations in the dialysate were 44.7 % vs. 30.5 %; 49.1 % vs. 14.3 %; 31.4 % vs. 7.1 %; and 29.9 % vs. 5.6 % relative to the levels in plasma at 0, 1, 24, and 48 h for EMiC2 and AV1000S, respectively. The filters did not differ significantly with respect to albumin removal.
