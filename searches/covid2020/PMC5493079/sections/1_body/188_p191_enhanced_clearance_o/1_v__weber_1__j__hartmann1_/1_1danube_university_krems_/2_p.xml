 <bold>Methods:</bold> Clearance of IL-6 was compared for the two filters in an in vitro set-up using spiked human plasma (800 pg/ml IL-6) as well as in a controlled randomized clinical trial including 30 patients with sepsis and acute renal dysfuncion. The protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee and CVVHD was performed using the multiFiltrate Acute Therapy System with Ci-Ca anticoagulation (Fresenius Medical Care). Plasma samples were taken at the start of CVVHD (0 h) and after 1, 24, and 48 h. A panel of 27 cytokines was determined in the plasma samples using a cytokine bead array. In addition, IL-6 and albumin were quantified in dialysate samples at the indicated time points.
