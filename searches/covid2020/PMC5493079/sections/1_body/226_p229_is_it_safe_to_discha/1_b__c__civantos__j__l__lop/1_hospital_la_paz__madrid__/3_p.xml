 <bold>Results:</bold> From February 2012 to October 2015, a total of 2568 patients were admitted to our ICU; during this period, 100 patients were discharged to the regular ward with tracheostomy tube in place. Of these, 68 % had neurological damages (due to head injury, ischemic and hemorrhagic events), 14 % chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 8 % severe miopathy, 6 % postanoxic encephalopathy, 2 % Guillain Barre and 2 % amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 10 % of the patients with a high length of stay had complications because of the tracheostomy (tracheal stenosis, granuloma and malacia), and all of them were solved. There were 2 readmissions to the ICU due to cannula obstruction. Decannulation at the ward was possible in 36 % of the patients, none of them had to be recannulated and all survived. Global mortality was 23 %, but excluding the patients under palliative cares, the mortality decreased to 5 % and the causes of death were not directly related to the tracheostomy.
