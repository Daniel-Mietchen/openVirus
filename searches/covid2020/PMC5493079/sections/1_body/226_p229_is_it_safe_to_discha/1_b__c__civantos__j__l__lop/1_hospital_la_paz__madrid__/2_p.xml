 <bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective study in a medical ICU in a tertiary care hospital that doesnâ€™t have a step-down unit. A two intensivists team followed up daily the patients discharged with tracheostomy from the ICU to the general ward until they were discharged from the hospital. Training sessions to the ward,s staff (doctors, nurses and nursing assistants) were made about tracheostomy cares every week. We analized clinical and epidemiologic variables, time to decannulation, complications related to the tracheostomy, decannulation failures, readmissions and mortality.
