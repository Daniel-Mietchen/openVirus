 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The international Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation (ELSO) publishes ECMO outcome scores. In 2015, Schmidt et al validated the SAVE score which uses 12 pre-ECMO variables derived from the ELSO dataset to assist in predicting survival after veno-arterial ECMO and to allow comparison between centres - we have evaluated our outcomes against this.
