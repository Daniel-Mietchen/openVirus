 <bold>Results:</bold> Administration of IT as an adjunct to systemic antibiotics was associated with a higher incidence of NP resolution (84 % vs. 52 %, p = 0,0322, χ criterion). The decrease of microbial titer to 103 to 104 CFU/ml was detected in both groups by days 5 to 7, but it was reliable in 73,6 % of the patients of group 1 (p &lt; 0.02). Eradication of microbes in BAL on day 7 was achieved in 72 % of IT-treated patients and in 48 % of antibiotic shift patients. Treatment with IT made it possible to wean patients earlier: by day 8.2 ± 1.5 vs. 11.1 ± 2.8 in the other group (p = 0.001). Hearing loss and tinnitus were detected only in three patients treated with IT. There were no cases of bronchospasm during inhalation of IT. The mortality rates did not differ between the groups (16 % in IT-group vs. 12 % in antibiotic shift group).
