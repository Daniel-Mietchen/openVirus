 <bold>Methods:</bold> Sixty ICU ventilated septic patients with NP were enrolled in the retrospective study (all male, 58.4 ± 6.3 years old; primary reason for ICU stay - intraabdominal infections (80 %), mediastinitis (13 %), other (9 %)). Diagnosis of NP was made according to the standard clinical and CPIS criteria. Associations of multiresistant gram-negative bacteria (sensitive to tobramycin) were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of all patients. Patients were randomized into two groups: IT (n = 30), addition of IT to systemic antibiotics (carbapenems, aminoglycosides, protected penicillins); and no IT (n = 30), shift of systemic antibiotics according to sensitivity. Groups were comparable in APACHE II and CPIS scores. Inhaled tobramycin was administered 300 mg twice daily via nebulizer. NP resolution on day 5 after IT initiation was assessed as a primary outcome. The data were statistically analyzed by STATISTICA 7.0 (M, σ, Newman- Keuls test; p &lt; 0.05).
