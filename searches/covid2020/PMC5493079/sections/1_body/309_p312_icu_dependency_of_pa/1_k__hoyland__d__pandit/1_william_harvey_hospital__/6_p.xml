<p id="Par2807">The number of OHCA-PPCI and unplanned admissions during the study period were 51 and 630 respectively. Median length of ICU stay were significantly high for the PPCI patients (4.25 vs 3.70 days, P = 0.02). Furthermore, PPCI patients had higher ICNARC severity scores (29.3 vs 20; p &lt; 0.0001). PPCI patients had significantly higher levels of dependency, evidenced by higher levels of organ support (3.2 vs 2 organs; p &lt; 0.0001), greater level 3 care (4.1 vs 2.6 days; p = 0.012), more days ventilated (4 vs 2.4 days; p = 0.005), and higher requirements for advanced CVS support (1.6 vs 0.6 days; p &lt; 0.0001). There were no significant differences between dialysis requirement or hospital length of stay. Overall ICU mortality rates were higher in the PPCI group (46.9 % vs 30.7 %, p = 0.02). Despite representing only 8 % of the total number of patients admitted during the study period, PPCI patients accounted for 12 % of total ICU level 3 bed days, 13 % of ventilated days and 19 % of advanced CVS days.</p>
