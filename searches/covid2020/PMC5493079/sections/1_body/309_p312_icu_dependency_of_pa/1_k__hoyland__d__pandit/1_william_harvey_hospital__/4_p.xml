<p id="Par2805">All adult patients admitted to our intensive care unit between April 2014 and March 2015 were analysed. Patients admitted from the PPCI pathway following OHCA were compared with all other unplanned admissions during the study period. Data regarding outcome and dependency was collected from the ICNARC (Intensive Care National Audit Research Council, UK) database.
