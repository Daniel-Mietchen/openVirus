 <bold>Results:</bold> Low PA was detected in 61 (17,8 %) patients in the selected group, which consisted of low operative risk patients with median Euroscore II value of 1,46 [IQR:0,97-2,03] and was associated with FFMI with Pearson’s R of 0,515 (p &lt; 0,001). Low PA was associated with higher rates (13 (21,3 %) vs. 30 (10,7 %) p = 0,023) and risk of postoperative morbidity in univariate regression analysis (OR = 2,27,Cl95% = 1,10-4,66, p = 0,026). Furthermore, low PA persisted as an independent factor in multivariate regression analysis (OR = 2,50, CI95% 1,18-5,29, p = 0,016) adjusted for preoperative risk factors of postoperative morbidity. Evaluation of hospitalization length revealed tendency of a prolonged hospitalization (&gt;14 days) rate (31 (50,8 %) vs. 105 (37,8 %), p = 0,063) in the group with low PA.
