 <bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary hospital. The nutrition state of cardiac surgery patients was evaluated using BIA the day before scheduled surgery. After applying selection criteria, 342 low operative risk patients were selected and classified into two groups in accordance to PA value: a low PA group and normal PA group. The correlation between low phase angle and low fat free mass index (FFMI), a marker of malnutrition, was assessed. Associations between low phase angle and adverse postoperative outcomes, defined by STS postoperative risk evaluation model, were analysed. The impact of low PA on length of stay in ICU and hospital was evaluated.
