 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Phase angle (PA), obtained from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), is a non-invasive method, for measuring altered electrical properties of biological tissues. It has been recognised as an objective prognostic marker of disease severity and frailty. The aim of this study is to determine, whether phase angle is a marker of malnutrition and postoperative morbidity in low operative risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
