 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> An increase in mortality for night discharges was noted. Hospital 1 had a higher rate of night discharges and a higher rate of delayed discharges. Hospital 2 has a lower rate of both. Possibly demonstrating that prompt discharge of patients leads to fewer night discharges. With the increase in mortality in those discharged at night, it highlights the importance of avoiding delayed discharges. Although a causal relationship between delayed discharge, night discharge and mortality cannot be proved; this data adds to the evidence. Demonstrating a higher mortality associated with night discharges and that delaying discharges contributes to a higher rate of night discharges. More research is required to explore this.
