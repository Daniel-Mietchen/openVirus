 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Octagenerians have higher ICU mortality rates compared to younger patients and their in-hospital mortality doubles. Readmission to ICU in analyzed period was associated with 100Â % mortality. Pre ICU performance status was independent risk factor for mortality. Careful evaluation is warranted before readmitting elderly patient to MICU. We encourage making clear therapeutic plan after ICU discharge with clear recommendations considering potential ICU readmission, re-introducing invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, vasopressor or commencing renal replacement therapy and antibiotic treatment.
