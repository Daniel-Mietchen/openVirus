 <bold>Results:</bold> In 2014, 1075 patients were admitted to our MICU, 244 aged 80 or more, oldest being 98. ICU mortality among octagenerians was 28 % and was significantly higher compared to the younger patients (19 % mortality; p &lt;0.0005). None of the patients aged 80 or more diagnosed with sepsis survived ICU. In-hospital mortality of octagenerians was 43 %. 10 patients (4 %) were readmitted to ICU, none of whom survived. Pre-admission performance status was not predictive considering ICU or hospital mortality.
