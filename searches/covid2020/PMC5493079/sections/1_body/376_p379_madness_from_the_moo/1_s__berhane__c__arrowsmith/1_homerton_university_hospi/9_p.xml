<p id="Par3489">Our study found no association between the incidence of delirium and the full moon in intensive care patients. We hypothesise that the reason for the persistence of the belief that the full moon is associated with increased psychiatric morbidity is due to confirmation bias. This may explain why patients received more sedative drugs during the full moon when compared to the new moon.</p>
