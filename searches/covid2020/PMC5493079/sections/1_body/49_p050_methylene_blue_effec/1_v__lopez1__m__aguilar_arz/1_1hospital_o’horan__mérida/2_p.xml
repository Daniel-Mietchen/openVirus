 <bold>Methods:</bold> A controlled, randomized, double blinded, clinical trial was performed. 60 patients were divided in two groups. A Group received a single dose of methylene blue calculated 2 mg/kg per body weight diluted in 100 cc of 5 % dextrose infused in 60 min. and C Group, (control) received 100 cc of 5 % dextrose infused in 60 min. Basal measurements of study variables were taken (MBP, lactate, base deficit, central venous saturation and CO2 delta) prior blue methylene administration and every hour afterwards, until MBP &gt;65 mmHg without vasopressor or 72 hours passed after shock began. Data about total noradrenaline dose in mg, length of stay, mechanical ventilation length and mortality was recorded
