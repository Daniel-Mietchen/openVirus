 <bold>Results:</bold> Of the 4732 patients, 57 % were male; mean age of 58 years old, mean SAPS III score of 58 points and 33,8 % of them died in the hospital. Univariate analysis showed a significantly higher risk of mortality in patients who developed mixed metabolic acidosis plus respiratory acidosis on their admission day (OR = 3.45, p-value &lt; 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that mixed metabolic acidosis plus respiratory acidosis (OR = 3.91, 95 % CI = 1.37-10.21, p-value = 0.003) and hyponatremia (OR = 0.58, 95 % CI = 0.31-0.65, p-value 0.01), patients with hyperkalemia had higher mortality (serum potassium over 5,1 mEq/L 43,4 % died and serum potassium over 6,0 mEq/L 76,5 % died; p 0.01 and p 0,002 respectively), were three significant predictors of mortality, regardless of other confounding variables.
