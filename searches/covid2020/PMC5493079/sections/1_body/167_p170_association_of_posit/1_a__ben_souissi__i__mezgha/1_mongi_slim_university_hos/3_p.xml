 <xref rid="Tab21" ref-type="table">21</xref> resume cumulative fluid balance. We noted a higher rate of septic shock, longer length of stay and mechanical ventilation duration in non-survivors group. The use of extra renal therapy was higher in non-survivors group (1 vs 11 p = 0.01). RIFLE score and diuretics use were also higher in non-survivors group (1 vs 2 p = 0.03 end 7 vs 16 p = 0.041). Non-survivors also showed higher accumulated positive fluid balance.
