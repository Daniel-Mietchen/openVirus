 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Fluid accumulation is very common throughout the course of a patientâ€™s ICU stay with the evidence of the potentially deleterious effects of fluids and electrolytes on many organ systems. A more conservative approach regarding fluid management strategy in ICU patient seems to be less deleterious, but randomized controlled trials addressing this issue were needed.
