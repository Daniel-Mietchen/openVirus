<p id="Par3081">Mechanical ventilation is often necessary in patients with poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and supra-normal oxygen levels are frequently achieved in the acute phase both in prehospital setting or in the intensive care unit. However the exact cerebral physiologic effects of normobaric hyperoxia have not been investigated in this setting in humans. Cerebral microdialysis (CMD) is a unique technique that allows the chemistry of the extracellular brain interstitial fluid to be monitored continuously at patient bedside.</p>
