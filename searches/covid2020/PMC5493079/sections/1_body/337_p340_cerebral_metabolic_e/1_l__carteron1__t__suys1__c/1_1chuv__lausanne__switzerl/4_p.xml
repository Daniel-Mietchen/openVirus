<p id="Par3083">Retrospective analysis of a prospective database of comatose patients after SAH monitored with CMD as part of standard care. The relationship of hyperoxia (defined as a supra-normal PaO2 &gt; 150 mmHg for at least 1 hour) with brain extracellular biomarkers (including CMD lactate, lactate/pyruvate ratio [LPR] and glutamate) was examined during the acute phase (first 48 hours) following SAH. Comparisons between groups were explored using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Approval for the study was obtained from our local Ethical Committee.</p>
