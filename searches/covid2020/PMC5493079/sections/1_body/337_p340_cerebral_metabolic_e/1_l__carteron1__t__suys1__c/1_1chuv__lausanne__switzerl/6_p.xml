<p id="Par3085">A total of 460 matched PaO2/CMD samples from 28 consecutive mechanically ventilated poor-grade SAH patients (median age 58 [10th-90th percentiles 42-68] years, median WFNS 5 [3-5]) were analyzed. Compared to non-hyperoxic samples (n = 366), those with hyperoxia (n = 94) were associated with higher CMD levels of lactate (3.5 [2-7.5] vs. 4.7 [2.3-9.1] mmol/L), LPR (30 [19-54] vs. 36 [23-53]) and glutamate (12.1 [2.2-61.2] vs. 27.2 [1.9-68.6] μmol/L) (all p &lt; 0.01), while main cerebral (PbtO2, ICP, CPP) and systemic (PaCO2, MAP) variables were within normal ranges and did not differ between the two conditions.</p>
