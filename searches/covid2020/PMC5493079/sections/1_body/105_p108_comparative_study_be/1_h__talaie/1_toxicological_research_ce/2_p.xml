Based on the manufacturer’s instruction and kidney function in each patient, drug dose was adjusted. Teicoplanin was administered at a loading dose of 6 mg/kg (400 mg maximum dose) for three loading doses every 12 hrs and then every 24 hrs for 7 to 10 days. Vancomycin was administered at a loading dose of 20 mg/kg every 12 hrs (maximum dose 2gr/day). Blood, urine and tracheal samples were cultured. Chest X-ray and routine Para clinical studies have been done in all cases. The study populations were assessed during 3 visits and one month follow up.
