<p id="Par3468">32 pigs under general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation were included in this study and were randomly assigned into one of the 4study groups (G-A, G-B, G-C, G-D-each group consisted of 8 animals). All pigs received continuous infusion of propofol and rocuronium. In G-A, no other intervention was performed, in G-B dexmedetomidine was administered in a dose of 0.8mcg/kg/hr, in G-C sepsis was induced by intravenous administration of LPS and in G-D both dexmedetomidine infusion and sepsis induction were performed in a similar manner like in G-B and G-C respectively. Study parameters included heart rate-HR, mean systemic-mSAP and pulmonary artery blood pressure-mPAP, central venous pressure-CVP and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure-PAOP. Parameters were recorded at baseline (phase-P0) and every 30 min for 3 hrs (P1-6). For the statistical analysis, repeated measures ANOVA was used (SPSS21).</p>
