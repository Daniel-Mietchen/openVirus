 <bold>Results:</bold> All animals had comparable variables at baseline. Right after exsanguination animals expectedly showed depression of cardiovascular variables. In addition, lactate and blood glucose were increased directly after blood loss. The drop in haemoglobin concentration still remained insignificant at 60 minutes after blood loss. Base deficit was only different 60 minutes post bleed.
