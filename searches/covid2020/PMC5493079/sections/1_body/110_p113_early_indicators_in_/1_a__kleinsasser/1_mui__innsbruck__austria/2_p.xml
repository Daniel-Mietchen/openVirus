 <bold>Methods:</bold> In this study we examined how acute haemorrhage affected cardiovascular, blood gas, laboratory and pulmonary gas exchange variables before, right after and 60 minutes after a 65 % blood loss in a model with anesthetized pigs. Blood pressure, lactate concentration, base deficit and blood glucose may all act as indicators for acute haemorrhage.
