<p id="Par2639">Critical illness is characterized by changes in the microbiology of the intestinal tract, leading to a loss of commensal flora and an overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria. Probiotics are living non-pathogenic bacteria colonizing intestine and providing benefits to the host. In 2012, we demonstrated that probiotics may be able to reduce infections and may influence intensive care unit (ICU) mortality1. Over the last three years different randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to update our previous data on probiotics in the critically ill.</p>
