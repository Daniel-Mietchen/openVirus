<p id="Par3204">We have been able to develop and deliver an in situ simulation program to our junior trainees within our ICU. The program has been well received and has increased junior traineesâ€™ understanding and confidence in dealing with a number of emergent scenarios. It has also helped to develop and increase their awareness of key non-technical skills in these situations. Finally, it has identified a number of logistical issues within our intensive care unit, which are being addressed through quality improvement projects.</p>
