 <bold>Results:</bold> The groups of survivors vs. nonsurvivors were similar in: age 66.0 (39.0; 84.0) vs. 68.0 (34.0;86.0) p = 0.162, men 184 (58.2 %) vs. 190 (60.1 %) p = 0.343, APACHE II score 26.0 (14.0; 39.0) vs. 28.0 (14.0; 40.0) p = 0.565 and the SOFA score 10.0 (4.0 – 16.0) vs. 10.0 (3.0 – 16.0) p = 0.912. Administration of the dose of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids for hypotension or lactate 4 mmol/L (3 hours) and application of vasopressors (6 hours) was performed in both groups, without statistically significant differences. Statistically significant differences between survivors vs. nonsurvivors were found in the parameter “Dose of norepinephrine in the first 24 hours”, 0.211 (0.022 - 1.104) vs. 0.333 (0.039 - 2.333), p &lt; 0.001, OR (95 % IS) 2.009 (1.362; 2.965), p &lt; 0.001
