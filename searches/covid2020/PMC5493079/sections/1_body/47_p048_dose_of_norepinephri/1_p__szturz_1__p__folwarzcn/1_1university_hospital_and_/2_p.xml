 <bold>Methods:</bold> We analysed a total of 632 consecutive patients with septic shock (sepsis-induced hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation) from the EPOSS database (Data-based Evaluation and Prediction of Outcome in Severe Sepsis), which was developed to monitor and assess the treatment efficacy in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Patients were admitted to participating intensive care units (twelve hospitals – seventeen high-volume care units) in the Czech Republic from 1st of January 2011 to 5th of November 2013. The patients were divided into two groups: survivors (n = 316) and nonsurvivors (n = 316).
