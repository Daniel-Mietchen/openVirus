<p id="Par3119">The BrainIT database contains the physiological and outcome data of 261 TBI patients [1]. We aimed to identify distinct patient groups distinguishable by the trajectory of their physiology over time using cluster analysis, a form of data mining [2]. We hypothesised that the resulting groups would have a good or poor outcome, measured by the extended Glasgow outcome score (eGOS). This would indicate physiological trajectories associated with a good or poor prognosis.</p>
