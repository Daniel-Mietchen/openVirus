<p id="Par3121">The MREC for Scotland approved the use of BrainIT data for scientific purposes in 2002, and need for informed consent was waived. We first cleaned the database, which left 155 patients. These patients were then clustered based on 24-hour trajectories of CPP, ICP, HR, SaO2, and mean BP. To do this, we applied the general linear mixed model, a form of cluster analysis [2], to the data to create three algorithms: Algorithm 1 clustered patients on minute-by-minute physiological data, Algorithm 2 used the same data with six outlying patients removed, and Algorithm 3 used hour-by-hour data, with the same six outlying patients removed as in Algorithm 2. Each algorithmâ€™s resulting clusters were paired to admissions data such as first GCS and outcome data as measured by eGOS.</p>
