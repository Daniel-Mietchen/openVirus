<p id="Par3123">Algorithm 1 identified six outliers with distinct and extreme physiological trajectories and eGOS. (n = 149, eGOS 5; n = 3, eGOS 7; n = 2, eGOS 1; n = 1, eGOS 1). The patients in Algorithm 2 did not separate into clusters (n = 149, eGOS = 5). Algorithm 3 revealed three clusters (n = 65, eGOS 5; n = 58, eGOS 5; n = 26, eGOS 6) with similar physiological trajectories and outcomes. However, as well as having a slightly better outcome, the cluster with an eGOS of 6 was older than the other two clusters and had a higher CPP and mean BP.</p>
