 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with an evidence of infection. Numerous inflammatory markers have been studied to assess the severity of sepsis. However, current biomarkers are insufficient to accurately determine stage and prognosis [1]. This study aimed to assess the cytokine Interleukin-8 (IL-8) for determining the stage and severity of sepsis. A comparison was made with C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), E-selectin, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumour Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α ).
