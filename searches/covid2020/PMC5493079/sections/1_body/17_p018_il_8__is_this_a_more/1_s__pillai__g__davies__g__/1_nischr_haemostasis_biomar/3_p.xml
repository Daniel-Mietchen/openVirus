 <bold>Results:</bold> 65 patients were included in the study: 40 with sepsis, 13 with severe sepsis and 12 with septic shock. PCT concentration was significantly increased in subjects with septic shock when compared to sepsis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>,*p = 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). IL-8 concentration was significantly increased in septic shock compared to both sepsis and severe sepsis groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, **p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.013 respectively, Kruskal-Wallis test). Using ROC analysis, IL-8 was found to be a significant predictor of mortality (AUC 0.92, p &lt; 0.001).
