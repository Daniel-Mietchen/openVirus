<p id="Par2717">Between May and September 2014 there were 628 HAC activation patients admitted to the legacy sites of the London Chest Hospital and Heart Hospital. Following the merger there was an increase of 246 patients (39 %). Of the HAC activations at the legacy sites from May-September 2014, 282 (45 %) patients underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention, pPCI, compared to 254 (29 %) patients in the five months post-merger. ICNARC data was not collected at the Heart Hospital and therefore data is only available from one legacy site. The ITU admission rate at the London Chest was observed as 4.9 % compared to 6.4 % in the new Centre. The length of stay on Intensive Care increased following the merger from a median 3.9 days (IQR 2.1-8.0) to a median 2.9 days (IQR 1.6-7.0). The in-unit mortality decreased in May-September 2015 to 41.1 % from 45.2 % the previous year.</p>
