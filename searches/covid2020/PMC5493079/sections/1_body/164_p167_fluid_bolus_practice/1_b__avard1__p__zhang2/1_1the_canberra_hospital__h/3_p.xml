 <bold>Results:</bold> We found that a balanced salt solution was the most commonly used for fluid bolus therapy in our unit, independent of patient disease or severity. The majority of fluid was prescribed by junior doctors between 4 pm and 8 am, within 48 hours of ICU admission, though there was an additional peak of bolus administration at day 5 for those who remained in the unit at this time. Patients received on average 1.3 L of fluid in boluses.
