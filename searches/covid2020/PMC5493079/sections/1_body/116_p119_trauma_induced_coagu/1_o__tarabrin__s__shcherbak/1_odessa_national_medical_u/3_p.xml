 <bold>Results:</bold> According to LPTEG indicators traumatic injuries patients has a statistically significant abnormalities in all parts of hemostatic system: platelet aggregation - Intensity of contact coagulation (ICC), the coagulation - Intensity of coagulation drive (ICD), clot maximum density (MA) and fibrinolytic activity - Index of retraction and clot lysis (IRCL). ICC in patients with traumatic injuries was reduced by 29.59 %, ICD was less than normal at 37.59 %, MA was reduced by 74.71 %, which showed coagulopathy, IRCL was 90,78 % above the norm, which stands expressed hyperfibrinolysis. Patients of 1st group according to LPTEG had significant changes in all parts of coagulation 24 hours after the intensive care. Indicators of platelet hemostasis characterized by persistence of hypoagregation: ICC was reduced by 24.71 %, compared to the norm; parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis have reliable trend toward normal and decreasing the activity of fibrinolysis index reaches normal reference values. Patients of 2nd group have hypoagregation and hypocoagulation state with decreased active of fibrinolysis: ICC was reduced by 24.72 %, ICD reduced by 20.76 %, MA was reduced by 23.54 %, IRCL was in the normal range. Clinically, patients of the 1st group had reducing the volume of blood transfusions as opposed to the 2nd group.
