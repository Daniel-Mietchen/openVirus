Patients were divided into 2 groups: 1st group (n = 46) as a treatment was received PCC in a dose of 1 ml/kg (25 IU/kg) and TXA in a loading dose of 1 g during 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 1 g during 8 hours at time of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU); 2nd group (n = 45) received FFP in a dose of 15 ml/kg and TXA in a loading dose of 1 g during 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 1 g during 8 hours.
