 <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a secondary analysis including data from 359 patients included in the PARTI trial. Copeptin was measured in batch-analysis on admission and after 7 days. We calculated cox regression models and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess an association of copeptin with mortality. Mortality data were collected through phone interviews 10 years after trial inclusion.
