 <bold>Results:</bold> After a median follow-up of 10.0 (interquartile range (IQR) 9.5-10.3) years, mortality was 9.8 %. Median admission copeptin levels were significantly elevated in non-survivors compared to survivors (13.8 pmol/l, IQR 5.9-27.8; vs. 6.3 pmol/l, IQR 4.1-11.5; p &lt; 0.001), Admission copeptin levels were associated with 10-year all-cause mortality (age-adjusted hazard ratio 1.7 (95%CI, 1.2-2.5); p &lt; 0.001, AUC 0.68). Results were similar for discharge copeptin levels. Admission and day 7 copeptin levels were also strong predictors for adverse outcome defined as death, pulmonary embolism and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.
