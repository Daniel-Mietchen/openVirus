 <bold>Introduction:</bold> St Elisabeth Hospital has a 30 bed ICU for critically ill adult patients. We facilitate family centred care, but in earlier years children were not allowed to visit family members in our ICU. The objective of our project was to facilitate paediatric visitation and to provide support related to the distress and needs of children with a relative in our ICU.
