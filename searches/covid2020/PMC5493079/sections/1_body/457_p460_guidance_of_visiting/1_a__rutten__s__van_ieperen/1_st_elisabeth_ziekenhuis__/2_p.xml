 <bold>Methods:</bold> Practical aids were developed for our caregivers. An information leaflet was made with practical information for parents. This was subdivided in developmental stages. Furthermore we created a book in which a child visits his father at our ICU. Pictures show what children can expect, which helps prepare the child for visiting. An instruction box is included with ICU materials (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig108" ref-type="fig">108</xref>). These materials are used to give children a more tactile experience of the ICU. Guidance materials for when a patient may die were developed included. For example: there are little boxes that can be decorated by the children to put in a memory or a token of grief. Pedagogical staff are available to support parents, children and staff. If there are more profound problems there will be referral to our children’s psychologist. Our hospital photographers can be called upon to commemorate the last moments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig109" ref-type="fig">109</xref>). We instructed our nurses and doctors on how to use these materials and how to guide children. We held a survey among our staff to inquire if this met their needs.
