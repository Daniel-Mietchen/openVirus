 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Hypercoagulability has been described both in cancer patients and also in sepsis, leading to microcirculatory failure and organ dysfunction in the latter. However, this is often overlooked by standard coagulation tests (SCTs).The aim of this pilot study was to compare hemostasis in cancer patients in the early stage of severe sepsis/septic shock to cancer patients without sepsis
