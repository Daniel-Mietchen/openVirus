 <bold>Results:</bold> After Ethics Committee approval, 32 patients in the SG and 26 patients in the CG were included. Patients in the SG had lower platelet number (p = 0.001), prolonged SCTs (p &lt; 0.001 for PT and aPTT) and lower II,V, VII, X, protein C, S (p &lt; 0.001) and antithrombin III(p = 0.015) levels. In the SG, ROTEM showed delayed activation of hemostasis, prolonged clotting times (p &lt; 0.001) and increased t-MaxVel (p = 0.001). But clot formation was similar in both groups with non-significant differences in maximum clot firmness (MCF), MaxVel and AUC. In the SG patients with APACHEII &gt; =25 had higher MCF (p = 0.026) and AUC (p = 0.003) as compared to patients with APACHE &lt; 25.
