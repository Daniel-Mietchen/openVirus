 <bold>Methods:</bold> Adult patients operated for solid tumors (in the first 30 days after surgery) admitted in the ICU with severe sepsis/septic shock were included in the study group (SG). Patients scheduled for elective surgery due to intra-abdominal or pelvic malignancies were included in the control group (CG). Exclusion criteria were: liver diseases, chronic kidney failure, hematologic diseases, pregnancy, chronic anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy and blood derivates or procoagulant treatments in the last 7 days. In both groups SCTs, plasma levels of coagulation factors and rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM®, Germany) were determined in the first 24-36 hours after admission in the ICU (SG) and just before surgery in the CG. The following indices were calculated from the first derivative of the clot firmness curve: Maximum Velocity (MaxVel), Time to Maximum Velocity of clot formation (t-MaxVel) and area under the curve (AUC) [1].
