 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study showed that cancer patients with severe sepsis/septic shock had similar hypercoagulability after a delayed clot initiation as compared to cancer patients without sepsis, despite thrombocytopenia and prolonged SCTs. These abnormalities were only detected by dynamic hemostasis measurements but not with SCTs. For firm conclusions the completion of this pilot study is required.
