 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We have shown that the use of terlipressin has improved patientâ€™s hemodynamic stability in brain death after NS, with an increased mean arterial pressure and decrease of lactates, compared to the use of norepinephrine. This has allowed an improvement in peripheral perfusion. Comparing the two groups we have reached statistical significance for each variable calculated.
