 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Brain death is a serious disease that affects brain parenchyma but also all other organs. Intensivistâ€™s task is to maintain organic homeostasis to allow PMD to reach withdrawal multiorgan in the best conditions, protecting from possible damage post neurovegetative storm (NS). NS causes severe hemodynamic instability resulting in peripheral hypoperfusion, hypotension, high values of lactates (LA), polyuria, depletion of catecholamine and stunning heart. Aim of our prospective study was to evaluate efficacy of terlipressin vs. norepinephrine in maintaining hemodynamic stability after NS [1].
