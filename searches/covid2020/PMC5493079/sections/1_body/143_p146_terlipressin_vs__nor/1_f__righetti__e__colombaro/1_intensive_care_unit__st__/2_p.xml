 <bold>Methods:</bold> 10 adult patients hospitalized in intensive care with acute brain injury, diagnosis of brain death, post NS, mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg. The patients were divided into two groups: 5 patients, group norepinephrine (infusion at 0.1 mcg/kg/min for 6 hours) and 5 patients, group terlipressin (infusion at 1.5 mcg/kg/h for 6 hours). These parameters were collected for each patients: mean arterial pressure (MAP), values of LA. The results were expressed as mean with standard deviation. For the comparison between the groups was used the Fisher test, considering significant for a p &lt; =0.05.
