 <bold>Results:</bold> Of the 139 patients evaluated for inclusion, 13 patients were excluded because of a history of chronic kidney disease, 5 patients were excluded because no creatinine at CRRT initiation was available, and 5 patients were excluded because an admission creatinine below 50 μmol/L. In the 116 included patients, 28-day mortality was 37 (32 %). In univariate proportional hazards cox regression analysis, ICU admission after cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( HR 4.403, p = 0.043), SOFA score ( HR 1.117, p = 0.024) and creatinine at CRRT initiation (HR 0.997, p = 0.020) were associated with 28-day mortality. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age (HR 1.092, p = 0.050), admission weight ( HR 1.036, p = 0.016) ICU admission because of respiratory failure (HR 9.275, p = 0.29) and creatinine at CRRT initiation (HR 0.990, p = 0.022) were associated with 28-day mortality. After correction for disease severity scores, such as APACHE 2 score and SOFA score, and markers for fluid overload, such as hematocrit and cumulative fluid balance, creatinine at initiation remained associated with lower 28-mortality. Even after correction for admission creatinine, only creatinine at initiation remained associated with 28-day mortality. In ROC curve analysis a CRRT initiation creatinin of 318 μmol/L was the best predictor for 28-day mortality.
