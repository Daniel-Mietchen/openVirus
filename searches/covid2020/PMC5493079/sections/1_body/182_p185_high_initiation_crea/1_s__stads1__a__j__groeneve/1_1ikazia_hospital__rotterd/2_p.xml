 <bold>Methods:</bold> A post-hoc analysis is performed on the multicenter data from the earlier published CASH study. In critically ill patients receiving CRRT, between 2005 and 2011, the effect of variables at initiation of CRRT on 28-day mortality were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis were performed to determine renal and patient-specific variables associated with 28-day mortality.
