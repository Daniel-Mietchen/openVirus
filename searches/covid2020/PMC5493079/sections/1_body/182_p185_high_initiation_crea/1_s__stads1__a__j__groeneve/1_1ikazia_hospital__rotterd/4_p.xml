 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this multicenter cohort, creatinine at CRRT initiation is an independent predictor of 28-day mortality, even after correction for admission creatinine, disease severity and hemodilution. Therefore these data argue in favour of a time-dependent effect of CRRT on 28-day mortality. These data suggest that late CRRT initiation may have better outcome then earlier CRRT initiation. However further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis and reveal underlying mechanisms.
