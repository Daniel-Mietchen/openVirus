 <bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The study was registered in the PROSPERO database (2015:CRD42015019539). We searched the PubMed, Embase and CENTRAL databases for articles in English. Inclusion criteria were RCTs studying adult patients with critical illness, treated in an intensive care unit. The intervention should be protocolized and based on results from hemodynamic measurements, defined as cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke volume variation, oxygen delivery, central venous oxygenation (ScvO2) or mixed venous oxygenation (SvO2). The control group should be treated without any structured intervention mentioned above. Exclusion criteria were pediatric, animal and perioperative studies. Primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were weight gain or fluid balance. Risk of bias was assessed independently of each other by two investigators. Statistical analysis was performed by RevMan 5.3 software.
