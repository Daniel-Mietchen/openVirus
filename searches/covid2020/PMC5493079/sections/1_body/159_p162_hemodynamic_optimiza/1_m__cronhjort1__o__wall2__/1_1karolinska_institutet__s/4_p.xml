 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> There is no evidence in the literature that hemodynamic monitoring combined with a structured intervention reduces mortality in critically ill patients. To investigate if mortality can be reduced by individualized hemodynamic management the monitoring has to be reliable, the intervention must be directed towards a meaningful treatment goal and the controls should receive standard of care.
