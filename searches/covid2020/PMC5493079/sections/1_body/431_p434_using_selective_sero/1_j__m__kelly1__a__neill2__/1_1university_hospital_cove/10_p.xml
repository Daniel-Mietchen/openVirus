 <bold>Results:</bold> We found few papers presenting useful evidence â€“ five cohort studies, one case series and seven case reports. We found no evidence for benefit from use of SSRI/SNRIs in critical care. We found some evidence of increased morbidity in patients using SSRI/SNRIs on admission to critical care. However due to inadequate administration reporting it was often unclear if they were actually continued, and therefore whether harm was due to chronic effects, ongoing use, or drug withdrawal.
