 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Our aim was to assess spirometry values 6Â months post ECMO. ECMO is used in severe acute respiratory failure refractory to conventional management. Support entails gas exchange through an extracorporeal oxygenator allowing lung rest as the underlying pathology resolves whilst preventing further damage from ventilator associated lung injury. Knowledge and experience in ECMO is growing however the significant costs and potential complications associated with the technique mean it is imperative to evaluate the longer term outcomes.
