 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> 20 % of our ECMO survivors demonstrated a moderate/severe obstructive, restrictive or mixed defect. These patients had a significantly longer ECMO run than those with normal values. This is comparable to a smaller study in ECMO patients and 2 studies assessing spirometry in conventionally treated ARDS patients at 6 months (1-3).
