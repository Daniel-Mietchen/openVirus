<p id="Par2440">Six patients were unable/unwilling to undertake spirometry leaving 94 patients’ data for analysis. Mean FEV1, FVC and PEF, presented as a % of that predicted (standard deviation) were 84.5 % (SD 21.4 %), 87.9 % (SD 21.5) and 97.6 % (SD 27.9) respectively. Normal values are &gt; =80 % predicted. 19 patients (20 %) had a FEV1 &lt; 70 % predicted, of which 7 patients (39 %) had a diagnosis of asthma. 19 patients (20 %) had FVC values &lt;70 % predicted, indicating a moderate or severe restrictive defect. Patients with FVC or FEV1 &lt; 70 % had a significantly longer time on ECMO than patients with values &gt; 70 % (11.3 vs 6.2 days, p &lt; 0.001).</p>
