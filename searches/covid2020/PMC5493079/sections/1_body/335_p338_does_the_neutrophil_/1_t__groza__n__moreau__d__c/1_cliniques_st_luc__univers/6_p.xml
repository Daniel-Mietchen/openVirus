<p id="Par3066">The cohort included 123 patients (71 % F, median age 53). Severity was high, with 40.7 and 50.4 % of the patients having respectively a Fisher grade 3 or 4 SAH. The mortality rate was 23.6 %. The median ICU LOS was 12 days (IQR:15-40). Asymptomatic vasospasm was noticed in 9.8 % of the patients, and symptomatic vasospasm in 36 %. DCI was demonstrated in 62 %. Early infection (within the first five days) was noticed in 15.4 %. The median NLR at ICU admission was 9.2 (IQR:5-12.7) for the entire cohort and NLR decreased over time with a median NLR at 6.4 on day 5 (IQR:4.6-9.6). The median NLR was different in patients with or without symptomatic vasospasm (7.8 vs 6.7,p = 0.045), but only on day 3. CRP values were different on day 1 and 4 in patients with early infection but showed no difference between patients with or without DCI. Univariate analysis found that younger age and Fisher grade were associated with DCI. Neither NLR nor CRP could predict the onset of DCI. Lower NLR at day 5 was associated with symptomatic vasospasm (OR:0.89[95%CI:0.79-0.98]) in univariate analysis. Following multivariate analysis, a younger age (OR:0.96[95%CI:0.93-0.99]) and a lower NLR at day 5 (OR:0.89[95%CI: 0.80-0.99]) were identified as risk factors for symptomatic vasospasm.</p>
