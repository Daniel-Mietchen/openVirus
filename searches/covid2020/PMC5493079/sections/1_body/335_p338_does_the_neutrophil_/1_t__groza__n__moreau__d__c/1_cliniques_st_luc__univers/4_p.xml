<p id="Par3064">We retrospectively reviewed data from consecutive SAH patients (Jan 1, 2004 - Jan 1, 2015) and recorded demographics, neurological examination, radiological and transcranial Doppler findings, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU, and mortality. NLR values were calculated from admission to the 5th hospital day. Medians were compared between groups using Mann Whitney U test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis using stepwise backward method was generated to predict the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm and DCI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess the accuracy of NLR to predict complications.</p>
