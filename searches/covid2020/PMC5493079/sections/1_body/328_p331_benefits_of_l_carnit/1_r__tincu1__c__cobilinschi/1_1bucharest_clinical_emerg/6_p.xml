<p id="Par2998">A total of 62 patients (34 in the standard group and 28 in the L-carnitine group) accomplished the inclusion criteria. L-Carnitine supplementation resulted in significant reductions in ammonemia (47.9 ± 6 vs. 61.9 ± 11.39 μ mol/L), determined after 24 hours, levels compared with baseline (P &lt; 0.001), whereas this parameter remained still high in standard group. The trend was similar for plasma VPA levels (p &lt; 0.05). Studied parameters were not influenced by gender, but were correlated with age (p = 0.01).</p>
