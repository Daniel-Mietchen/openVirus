<p id="Par2994">Valproic acid (VPA) is widely used as antiepileptic drug, which is known to induce hepatotoxicity and hyperammonemia encephalopathy. These toxic side effects are produced by a decrease in the carnitine blood-levels, of which the valproic acid is directly responsible. The aim of this report is to demonstrate the benefits of L-carnitine supplementation in patients with acute valproic acid intoxication. Patients who are chronically treated with VPA show low levels of carnitine by depletion of its deposits, therefore L-carnitine addition proves to be appropriate.</p>
