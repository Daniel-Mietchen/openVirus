 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The parallel changes in BV, VRdp and Q
 <sub>PA</sub>, estimated by mutually independent methods, support the Guytonian model and stress the importance of RAP as backpressure to venous return. The linear relationship between changes in BV and MSFP
 <sub>RAO</sub> indicate a constant C
 <sub>vasc</sub> and that changes in BV translated fully into change in V
 <sub>s</sub>.
