 <bold>Methods:</bold> We measured in anesthetized pigs (n = 10; 2 early deaths) pulmonary artery blood flow (Q
 <sub>PA</sub>; ultrasonic flow probe), RAP and MSFP (venous pressure at zero flow during right atrial balloon occlusion; MSFP
 <sub>RAO</sub>) at 
 <italic>baseline</italic>, after bleeding of 9 mL/kg body weight (
 <italic>hypovolemia</italic>) and after retransfusion of the shed blood and an equal amount of hydroxyethyl starch (
 <italic>hypervolemia</italic>). Blood volume (BV; indocyanine green dye dilution) was measured at 
 <italic>baseline</italic> and 
 <italic>hypervolemia</italic> and calculated for 
 <italic>hypovolemia</italic> as BV
 <sub>
  <italic>baseline</italic>
 </sub> minus shed volume. Stressed volume (V
 <sub>s</sub>) was defined from systemic vascular compliance (C
 <sub>vasc</sub> = Δ BV/Δ MSFP
 <sub>RAO</sub>) at MSFP
 <sub>RAO</sub> = 0. Statistics: analysis of variance for repeated measures.
