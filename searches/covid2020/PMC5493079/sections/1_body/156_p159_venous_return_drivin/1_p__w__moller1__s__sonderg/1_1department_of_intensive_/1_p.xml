 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Guytonâ€™s venous return model helps to interpret circulatory response to blood volume changes. The model implies that venous return depends on the venous return driving pressure (VRdp), i.e. the difference between mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) and right atrial pressure (RAP), and resistance to venous return (RVR). We studied VRdp and RVR response to hypo- and hypervolemia in pigs with intact circulation.
