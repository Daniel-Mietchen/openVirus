 <bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a single centre pilot study nested within a multicentre, double-blind, cluster-randomised, double crossover trial. All adult patients who required crystalloid fluid as part of the SPLIT trial [1], expected to require mechanical ventilation for &gt;48Â hours and receiving enteral nutrition exclusively by a NG tube were eligible. The study ICU used either blinded saline or PL-148 for four alternating seven week blocks. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with GI feeding intolerance, defined as high gastric residual volumes (GRV), diarrhoea or vomiting while receiving NG feeding in the ICU. The proportion of patients with each of high GRV, diarrhoea, and vomiting were secondary outcomes.
