 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Early clinical trials and experimental data have reported that the use of unbuffered fluids may adversely influence gastrointestinal (GI) function when compared to buffered fluids. GI dysfunction and nutritional feeding intolerance is common amongst critical unwell patients. No previous studies have assessed the GI effects of different crystalloid fluids in critically ill patients.
