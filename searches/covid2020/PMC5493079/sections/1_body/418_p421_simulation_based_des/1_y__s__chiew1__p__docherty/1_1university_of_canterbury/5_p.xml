 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This stopping rule design method can be adapted for any two-arm RCT that monitors probabilistic and binary outcomes. This approach in designing a RCT stopping rule can be adjusted to the participating cohort using local data and based on the desired study characteristics, and fulfills ethical needs for a statistically justifiable stopping rule.
