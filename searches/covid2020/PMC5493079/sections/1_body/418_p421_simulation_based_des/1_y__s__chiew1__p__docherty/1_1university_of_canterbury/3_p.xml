 <bold>Results:</bold> The stopping rule determined is as shown in the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig104" ref-type="fig">104</xref>. The y-axis is the mortality difference (MDiff) between MC and MI. Each line denotes a stopping rule for a different MC. For example, if MC is observed at 20% at sample size per arm of 100, the MDiff required to terminate the trials is 19%. Thus, the MI threshold for triggering the stopping rule is 39%. In practice, this means that if interim analysis of 100 patients per trial arm includes 20 deaths in the control group, the intervention group must observe 39 deaths or more to stop the trial (MI &gt; = 39%).
