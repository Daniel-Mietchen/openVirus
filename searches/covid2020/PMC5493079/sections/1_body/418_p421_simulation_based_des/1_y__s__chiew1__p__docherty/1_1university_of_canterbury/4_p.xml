<p id="Par3743">For MC = 30% at sample size per arm of 430 patients, the MDiff from the Figure is approximately 9%. This mortality difference is similar to the result found in the ARDSnet trial when comparing lower and traditional tidal volume ventilation [1]. The ARDSnet trial found a mortality difference of 31.0% versus 39.8% was significant when ~430 patients per arm were recruited to the trial, and the early termination of the trial was triggered. This result further validates this stopping rule design method presented in this study.</p>
