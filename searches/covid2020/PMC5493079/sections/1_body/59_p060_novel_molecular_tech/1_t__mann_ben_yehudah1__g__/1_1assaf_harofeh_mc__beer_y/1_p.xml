 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Currently, CVC related BSIs are categorized as either CRBSI or CLABSI. Both methods have major diagnostic limitations. They both have low sensitivity, particularly among patients already receiving antibiotics. Another limitation is the prolonged time that it takes for diagnostic results to become available, which can adversely impact therapy and clinical outcomes. Molecular techniques to diagnose CRBSI are less established. No study to date has attempted to diagnose CVC related infections in septic ICU population using molecular techniques. Our study tested different molecular techniques designed specifically to diagnose CVC associated infections and compared them to standard CVC tip and blood cultures. We also attempted a new culture method for CVC tips using saline vortexing.
