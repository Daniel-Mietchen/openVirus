 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> These molecular systems show promise for rapid line sepsis identification. False negativity is probably related to prior antimicrobial treatment. The RT-PCR also had some false positivity possibly reflecting potential treatable organisms missed by standard cultures. The commercial multiplex PCR kit showed lower sensitivity than the RT-PCR.
