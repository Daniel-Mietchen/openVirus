 <bold>Methods:</bold> ICU patients with a CVC suspected of having sepsis were included. Blood was extracted for PCR and regular cultures. CVCs were extracted and tips were cultured by the semiquantitive method and also vortexed in saline which was subjected to PCR and regular cultures. PCR was done both by Biofire commercial kit (multiplex PCR) and by RT-PCR using unique primers targeting common ICU organisms. Organism load was quantified using threshold cycle (Ct) with a cutoff of 35 used for a positive result. All methods were compared.
