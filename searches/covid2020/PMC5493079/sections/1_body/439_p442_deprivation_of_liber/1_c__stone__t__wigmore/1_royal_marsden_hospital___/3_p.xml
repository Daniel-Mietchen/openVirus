 <bold>Results:</bold> Out of a total of 994 admissions, 34 patients lacked capacity at some point during their stay. These were divided into emergency medical (56%), elective surgical (35%) and emergency surgical admissions (9%) respectively. Of 31 patients who were retrospectively deemed eligible for a DoLS, 7 (23%) had an application submitted to the local council. The reasons why authorisations were necessary were divided in to tracheostomy related (45%), chemical/physical restraint for delirium (39%) and other best interest decision (16%). On average a DoLS authorisation was necessary for 4.5 days. The local authority denied no applications. The average time between identifying a lack of capacity and completion of DoLS application was 5.2 days.
