 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The aim of this audit is to investigate the compliance of a critical care unit (CCU) with the application of Deprivation of liberty safeguards (DoLS) authorisations. DoLS form part of the UKâ€™s Mental Capacity Act and are intended to safeguard the rights of patients who lack mental capacity, and whose freedom to leave a healthcare environment is potentially limited.[1] They require written application to the local authority in order to gain permission for the patients on going care. However, because of the fact that this situation potentially applies to some patients in the CCU, an unintended consequence of the legislation is that it is increasingly being applied to critically ill patients. This can result in a significant workload for both the critical care team and the local council.
