 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> A significant number of patients admitted to CCU who lack mental capacity may be at risk of having their liberty deprived. A compliance rate of 23% may be a reflection of the way DoLS can now be applied to CCUs. Local interventions, such as routine pre-consent and streamlining of the DoLS application process are being implemented with the intention of reducing work load and improving the rate of compliance with the law.
