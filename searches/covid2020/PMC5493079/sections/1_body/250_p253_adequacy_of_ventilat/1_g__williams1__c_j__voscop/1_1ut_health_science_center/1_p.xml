 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Opioid use decreases respiratory drive and can cause opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), which is challenging to recognize in non-intubated patients from respiratory rate (RR) alone. Using a non-invasive respiratory volume monitor (RVM) that measures minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume (TV) and RR, we examined whether RR alone can identify LowMV episodes (used to define OIRD) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).
