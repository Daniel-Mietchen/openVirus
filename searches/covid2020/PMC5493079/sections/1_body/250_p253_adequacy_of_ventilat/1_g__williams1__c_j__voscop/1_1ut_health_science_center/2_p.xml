 <bold>Methods:</bold> After written informed consent, MV, TV and RR measurements were collected via RVM (ExSpiron, Respiratory Motion, Waltham MA) from 358 patients (age: 67.1, 19-91 yrs; BMI: 29.8,19-49 kg/m2) undergoing elective joint replacement surgery. 205 patients received PCA opioids in the PACU: 96 received hydromorphone (0.2 mg) and 109 received morphine (1 mg per dose). RVM measurements were calculated from 30-second segments in the 30 minutes before and after first dose. Predicted MV (MVPRED) was calculated from each patient’s BSA. LowMV was defined as MV &lt; 40%MVPRED for &gt;1 min. LowRR was defined as RR &lt; 6breaths/min. Sensitivity and specificity analysis correlated LowRR with LowMV.
