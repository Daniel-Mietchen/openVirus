 <bold>Results:</bold> For patients receiving opioids, LowMV occurred 13.7 % of the time before and 17.8 % of the time after a dose. Importantly, LowRR coincided with less than 12.5 % of all LowMV episodes. On average, patients experienced 1.5 ± 0.2 LowMV episodes before opioid (range: 0-9episodes; duration: 2.17 ± 0.13 min) and 1.8 ± 0.2 LowMV episodes (0-9episodes; 2.40 ± 0.12 min) after opioid dosage (p &gt; 0.5). In both groups, a low RR alarm set to below 6 breaths/min would miss 88.3 % of LowMV episodes, yielding a sensitivity of 12.4 %, specificity 98.5 %, positive predictive value 60.5 %, and negative predictive value 85.8 %.
