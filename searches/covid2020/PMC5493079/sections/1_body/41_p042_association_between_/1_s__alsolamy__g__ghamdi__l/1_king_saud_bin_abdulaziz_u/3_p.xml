 <bold>Results:</bold> We identified 4,629 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, 623 of whom had a previous prescription for β -blockers before hospital admission and 4006 of whom were not previously taking β -blockers. Common medications used by patients were metoprolol (77 %) and carvedilol (13 %). The overall mortality rate was 30 %. Among patients who were previously taking β -blockers, 181 (29.1 %) died in the ICU and 442 (70.9 %) were discharged alive. Of the patients who did not have a previous prescription for β -blockers, 1,231 (30.7 %) died in the ICU and 2,775 (69.3 %) were discharged alive. There was no statistically significant association between patients having a previous prescription for β -blockers and ICU mortality (risk ratio 0.94; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.08; p = .39). We further stratified patients on the basis of highest heart rate in the first 24 hours of ICU admission into those with a heart rate &gt;95 beats per minute and those with a heart rate of &lt; =95 beats per minute. There were no statistically significant association between patients who had a previous prescription for β -blockers and ICU mortality in either group (risk ratio 0.91; 95 % CI 0.77 to 1.06; p = 0.22) and (risk ratio 1.095; 95 % CI 0.78 to 0.1.54; p = 0.60) respectively.
