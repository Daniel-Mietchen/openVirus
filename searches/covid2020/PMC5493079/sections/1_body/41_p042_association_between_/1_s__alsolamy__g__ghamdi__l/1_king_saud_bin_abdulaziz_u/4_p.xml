 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study demonstrated no significant association between previous prescription for β -blockers and ICU mortality. This held true even after further stratification of patients on the basis of highest heart rate in the first 24 hours of ICU admission. This result may be due to lack of effect of β -blockers or short-term action of medication use.
