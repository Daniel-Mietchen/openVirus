 <bold>Results:</bold> 23 patients were included of which 13 had overt DIC, the majority was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis. Patients with DIC had lower platelet count and lower levels of fibrinogen, factors II, VII and VIII compared to patients without DIC. Endogenous anticoagulants; antithrombin, protein C and S were also reduced in DIC patients. Thromboelastometry profiles were more hypocoagulable in DIC patients compared to those without DIC: EXTEM CFT: 183 [142-240] in DIC vs 72 [45-177] in non-DIC (p &lt; 0.05), alpha: 60 [51-69] in DIC vs 79 [66-81] in non-DIC(p &lt; 0.01) and MCF: 49 [43-58] in DIC vs. 63 [58-73] in non-DIC patients (p &lt; 0.05). ROTEM EXTEM variables indicating hypocoagulability correlated with DIC scores and with low levels of endogenous anticoagulants (Table
