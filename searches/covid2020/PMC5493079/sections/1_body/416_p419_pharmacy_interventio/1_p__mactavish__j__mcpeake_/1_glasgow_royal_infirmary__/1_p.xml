 <bold>Introduction:</bold> During an intensive care stay, patients often have their chronic medications withheld for a variety of reasons and new drugs commenced [1]. As patients are often under the care of a number of different medical teams during their admission there is potential for these changes to be inadvertently continued [2]. Intensive Care Syndrome: Promoting Independence and Return to Employment (InS:PIRE) is a five week rehabilitation programme for patients and their caregivers after ICU (Intensive Care Unit) discharge at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Within this programme a medication review by the critical care pharmacist provided an opportunity to identify and resolve any pharmaceutical care issues and also an opportunity to educate patients and their caregivers about changes to their medication.
