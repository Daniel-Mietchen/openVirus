 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The pharmacist identified pharmaceutical care issues with 18.6% of the prescribed medications. Just over half of the patients reported that they were not made aware of any alterations to their prescribed medication on discharge. Therefore a pharmacy intervention is an essential part of an intensive care rehabilitation programme to address any medication related problems, provide education and to ensure patients gain optimal benefit from their medication.
