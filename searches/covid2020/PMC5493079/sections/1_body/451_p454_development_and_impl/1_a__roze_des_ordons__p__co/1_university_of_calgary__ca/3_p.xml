 <bold>Results:</bold> The survey response rate was 7/7 fellows, 15/29 staff physicians, 56/404 nurses, and 1/5 social workers. More than 50% of non-fellow respondents identified that fellows ranked below expectations in counseling about the emotional impact of emergency situations; fellows reported they had the least amount of training in this area and were least comfortable addressing patient and family emotional issues. Staff physicians were least comfortable teaching and assessing fellows’ capacity to address emotion, and had received the least amount of training in this area themselves. All non-trainee groups described fellows’ focus on giving information over building rapport; fellows indicated their challenges may be related to the absence of a prior relationship with patients and families, and their own discomfort in talking about death and dying. Despite challenges in the relational aspects of communication, topics of greatest interest to fellows included organ donation, adverse events, conflict, and family meetings. Preferred learning methods included simulation and feedback in clinical practice. This data guided the development of a communication skills curriculum involving 5 formal sessions over a year, and structured feedback during CCM rotations. Each formal session consisted of a didactic presentation and simulated practice. One formal session was dedicated to basic principles of communication, which were incorporated into each of the topic-based sessions. A form to guide multidisciplinary preceptors in providing feedback to fellows in clinical practice was also developed and implemented. Preliminary data indicate that fellows value the curriculum and feedback; more objective curricular evaluation is ongoing.
