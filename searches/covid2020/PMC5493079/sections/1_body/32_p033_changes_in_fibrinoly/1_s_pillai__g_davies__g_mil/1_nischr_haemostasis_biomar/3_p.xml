 <bold>Results:</bold> 95 patients were included in the study: 49 with sepsis, 19 with severe sepsis and 27 with septic shock. 44 healthy volunteers were recruited as a matched control. D-Dimer concentration was 422 (297, 881) ng/mL in sepsis, 789 (374, 1586) ng/mL in severe sepsis and 3073 (765, 7279) ng/mL in septic shock (normal range &lt;250 ng/mL). Median EXTEM LI60 (%) in healthy volunteers was 92 (88.3, 94). ROTEM indicated fibrinolytic function that was comparable to healthy volunteers in the sepsis and severe sepsis groups (93 (90, 95) and 91 (87, 96) respectively), but fibrinolytic function was significantly impaired in septic shock compared to all other groups (97 (95, 98), p &lt; 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni correction). Impaired fibrinolytic function was also significantly associated with mortality (INTEM LI60 of 94 (90.5, 96) in survivors vs 96 (94.8, 96) in non-survivors, p = 0.006, Mann-Whitney U Test).
