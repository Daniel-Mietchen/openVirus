 <bold>Introduction:</bold> It is well recognised that coagulation is altered across the sepsis spectrum (sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock). Sepsis is recognised to be a prothrombotic state, due to an increased procoagulant activity and impairment of the natural anticoagulants and fibrinolytic proteins [1]. Altered fibrinolysis could have a key role in the accumulation of microthrombi leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The aim of this study was to assess the changes in fibrinolysis across the sepsis spectrum using the Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) lysis index (LI60) and D-dimer concentration.
