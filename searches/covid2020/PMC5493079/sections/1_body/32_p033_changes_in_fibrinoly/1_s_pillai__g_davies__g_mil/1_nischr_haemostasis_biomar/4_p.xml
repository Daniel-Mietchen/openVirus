 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Fibrinolytic activity was increased in patients with septic shock. However there was an impairment of the fibrinolytic function as measured by ROTEM. The exact mechanisms leading to this are not fully understood, however consumption of fibrinolytic factors could contribute as evidenced by elevated D-Dimer concentration. ROTEM lysis index (LI60) can potentially be used as a biomarker to identify septic shock and as an outcome measure, although this study was not powered for outcome.
