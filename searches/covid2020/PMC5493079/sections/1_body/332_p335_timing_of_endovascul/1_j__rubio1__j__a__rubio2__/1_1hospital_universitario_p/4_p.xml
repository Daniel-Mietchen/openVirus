<p id="Par3040">We performed a prospective, observational cohort study at a tertiary university 750-bed hospital including patients with severe aSAH admitted to the Intensive (ICU) or Intermediate Post-operative Care Unit (IMCU) after trying early endovascular coiling or surgical clipping over a 1-year period (November 2014 to October 2015). We analysed demographic, comorbidities, APACHE II score, Fisher and Hunt-Hess grade, aneurysm characteristic, type of treatment, time interval between ICU or IMCU admission and invasive procedure, ICU, IMCU and hospital length of stay, and outcomes variables. The study outcomes were mortality, readmissions and re-operations.</p>
