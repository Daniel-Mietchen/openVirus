<p id="Par3038">Aneurismal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The primary goal of the treatment is the occlusion of the ruptured aneurysm preventing a rebleeding. To reduce the rate of this adverse event current guidelines recommend that surgical clipping or endovascular coiling should be performed as early as feasible.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of timing of invasive treatment for aSAH on clinical outcomes.</p>
