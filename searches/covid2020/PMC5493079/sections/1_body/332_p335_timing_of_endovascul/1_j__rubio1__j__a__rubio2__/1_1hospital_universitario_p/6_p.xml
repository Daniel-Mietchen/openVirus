<p id="Par3042">A total of 31 patients were included aged 56.5 ± 9.8 years old, with 22 (71 %) females and APACHE II score on admission 15.9 ± 8.4. Endovascular coiling was performed in 27 (87 %) and surgical clipping 4 (13 %) patients. Twenty-three (74.2 %) patients were admitted to the ICU and eight (25.8 %) to the IMCU. Aneurysms were mainly on anterior location (71 %), with saccular morphology (64.5 %) and medium size (7.8 ± 3.4 mm). Fisher and Hunt-Hess grade 4 occurred most frequently. A total of 7 (22.6 %) patients (5 coiling, 2 clipping) died during ICU stay. The mean time from ICU admission to procedure performed was shorter in this group than in the survivor group (0.8 days [95 % CI 0.2 to 1.5]) versus 2.2 days (95 % [CI 1.4 to 2.9]); P = 0.03). There was no correlation between time from admission to procedure and ICU, IMCU or hospital length of stay. Only one patient was readmitted to the ICU and in three was necessary repeat a new invasive procedure.</p>
