 <bold>Introduction:</bold> High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV) offers attractive lung protective features by providing mean airway pressures but minimal tidal alveolar pressure/volume swings. Small trials have suggested benefit to HFOV but two recent large trials (OSCAR and OSCILLATE) suggested either no benefit or even harm [1,2]. Questions of generalizability have been raised. In OSCILLATE, enrolled subjects were often in shock and mandated unusually high mean airway pressures. This combination can be difficult to manage in centers with variable expertise in HFOV management. Because our institution has considerable HFOV experience, we retrospectively reviewed all of the patients who received HFOV with us over the last 7Â years.
