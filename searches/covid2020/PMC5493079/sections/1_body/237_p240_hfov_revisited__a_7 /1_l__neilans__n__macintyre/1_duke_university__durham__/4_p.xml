 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Despite limitations to our study (retrospective, observational and with limited data availability), we think our lower HFOV mortality despite worse baseline oxygenation when compared to OSCILLATE and OSCAR is notable. This may reflect lower HFOV mean airway pressures in shock patients as well as having experienced personnel available 24Â hours a day in our institution. We conclude there may still be a role for HFOV in severe ARDS if patients are properly selected and careful attention is paid to mean airway pressures.
