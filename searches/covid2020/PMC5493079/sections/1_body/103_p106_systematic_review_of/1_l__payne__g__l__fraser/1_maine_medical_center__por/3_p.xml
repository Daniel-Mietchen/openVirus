 <bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-five identified publications described cefepime induced neurotoxicity in 137 patients. Patient characteristics included both ICU (17 %) and non-ICU patients (4 %), but patient location was unspecified in most cases (79 %). Symptoms included encephalopathy (75 %), myoclonus (41 %), seizures (11 %), and coma (1 %). Renal dysfunction was present in 93 (68 %) patients and cefepime dosing was appropriate, excessive, or unable to be assessed for 20 %, 41 %, 39 % respectively. Symptom onset was between 1-15 days (median 4) after initiation of therapy with resolution within 3 days (median 2) of cessation of cefepime. Emergent hemodialysis was employed in one case, and 55 patients (40 %) required treatment with an antiepileptic medication. Serum levels were collected in 12 patients and were exceeding toxic thresholds (&lt;20 mcg/ml) in 11 patients (mean 64 ug/mL). Ninety-one patients (66 %) survived, 13 patients died (9 %), and the individual outcomes of the remaining patients were unreported. Complete neurologic recovery was reported in 62 patients (45 %) and symptom improvement in 27 (20 %). All patients with reported neurologic recovery did not improve until cefepime was discontinued.
