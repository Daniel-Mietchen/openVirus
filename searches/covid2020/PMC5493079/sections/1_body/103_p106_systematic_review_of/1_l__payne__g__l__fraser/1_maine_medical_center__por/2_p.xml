 <bold>Methods:</bold> A librarian-assisted search was conducted to create a list of all publications associated with cefepime associated neurotoxicity patients from 1980-2015. Our search employed the CINAHL and MEDLINE databases for article identification and the PRISMA-P protocol was followed to promote robust reporting of data. To determine eligibility for study inclusion, identified articles were independently assessed by two reviewers.
