 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Cefepime is a widely used antibiotic with the potential for significant, but under-appreciated neurotoxicity due to its ability to cross the blood brain barrier and antagonize GABA activity in a concentration dependent fashion. Data suggest that 15Â % of ICU patients treated with cefepime will experience neurotoxicity with symptoms that range from encephalopathy, myoclonus, seizures and coma. Recognition of this adverse event is difficult since these symptoms are commonly experienced by the critically ill. We reviewed published literature to further characterize this adverse drug event.
