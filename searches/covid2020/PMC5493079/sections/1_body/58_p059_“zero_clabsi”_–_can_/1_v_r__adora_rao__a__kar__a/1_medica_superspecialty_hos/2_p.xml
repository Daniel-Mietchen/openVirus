 <bold>Methods:</bold> This Quasi experimental, interventional study enrolled patients (In house and Day Care) with Central Line devices in all units of our 355 bedded hospital from Jan 2012 to Oct 2015. Data collected prospectively by means of active surveillance (audits and HAI tracking sheet) on practices pertaining to Central Lines showed fluctuating CLABSI rates, above the NSHN benchmark 2.79 and consequent Root Cause Analysis identified non conformities with standard practices across all the units in the hospital. In response, a robust program was devised and implemented in the month of Jan 2013, targeting “Zero CLABSI”.
