 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This novel protocol addresses many of the specific clinical and logistic challenges faced by retrieval teams. The protocol contains specific guidance yet provides flexibility to encompass the variety of major haemorrhage scenarios encountered, which may range from roadside polytrauma to the inter-facility transfer of an intensive care unit patient. The goal is seamless transition of care with ongoing damage control resuscitation from point of referral, during transfer, and upon arrival at the receiving centre.
