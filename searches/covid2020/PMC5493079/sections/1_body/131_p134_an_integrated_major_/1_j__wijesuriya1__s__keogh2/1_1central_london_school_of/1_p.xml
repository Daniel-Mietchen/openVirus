 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Irrespective of aetiology, major haemorrhage is associated with poor patient outcome and its management presents considerable clinical and logistic challenges. The introduction of in-hospital major haemorrhage protocols, following damage control resuscitation (DCR) principles, has demonstrated improved patient outcome and blood product delivery with reduced wastage of blood products.
 <sup>1,2</sup> However, simple adaptation of hospital-derived protocols is inadequate for use by retrieval teams and a tailored approach is required to address the specific challenges encountered.
