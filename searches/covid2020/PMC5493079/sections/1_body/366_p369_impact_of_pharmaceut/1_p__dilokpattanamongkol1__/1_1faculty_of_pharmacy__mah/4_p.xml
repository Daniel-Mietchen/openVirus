<p id="Par3384">A before-after study at the medical ICU (total of 8 beds) of the university hospital was conducted on mechanical ventilated patients receiving sedative agents. Baseline characteristics, active problems and APACHE II were used as the criteria to match the patients between two groups, the retrospective group (no pharmacist interventions) and the prospective group (pharmacist interventions). Medical chart reviews were performed and data were collected over a 2-year period in the retrospective group. In the prospective group, pharmacists made interventions with the team to select sedative agents to individual patients based on underlying disease, active problems, renal and hepatic function, and causes of patient agitation.</p>
