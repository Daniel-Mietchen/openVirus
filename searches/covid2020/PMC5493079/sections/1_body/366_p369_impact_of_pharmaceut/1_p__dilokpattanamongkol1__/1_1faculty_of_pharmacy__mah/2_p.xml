<p id="Par3382">As underlying diseases and causes of agitation are varied in different patients, a selection of sedative agents should be made individually. Currently, there is a lack of guideline for the sedative use in the medical intensive care unit (ICU), Ramathibodi Hospital. A prescription of sedative agents performed by critical care pharmacists during patient care rounds, based on appropriate guidelines and patient data would shorten the ICU length of stay (LOS). This study was set out to investigate the impact of pharmacist interventions on ICU LOS, hospital LOS, ventilator days and mortality in Medical Intensive Care patients at Ramathibodi Hospital.</p>
