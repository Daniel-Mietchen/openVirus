 <bold>Results:</bold> During study period, 294 patients were included: median age 40 (IQR 25–58), ISS 29 (21–58), SAPS II 34(25–45), 76 % of male, 15 % of massive transfusion and 52 % of severe trauma head injury. After analysis of LFM,157 patients (53 %) were classified as conservative LFM and 137 (47 %) as liberal LFM. These two groups did not significantly differ in term of baseline characteristics, severe injuries, severity criteria or transfusion needs. Daily and cumulative fluid balances were also identical between these groups from Day 0 to Day 2. Conversely, liberal LFM was significantly associated with more ventilation days (11 vs 8.5 days; P = 0.02), less ventilator-free days at Day 30 (19 vs 21 days; P = 0.03), longer ICU stay (19 vs 16 days; P = 0.03) and hospital stay (30 vs 25 days; P = 0.04). Mortality rates were comparable between both groups (6 %). Multivariate analysis also highlighted that liberal LFM was independent risk factor for a reduced ventilator-free days at Day 30 (B = -2.1 [95%CI -4.1–-0.1], P = 0.042), as well as ISS score, severe trauma head injury and massive transfusion needs.
