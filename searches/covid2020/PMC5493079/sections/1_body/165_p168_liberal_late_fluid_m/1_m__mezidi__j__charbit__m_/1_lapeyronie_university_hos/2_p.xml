 <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective analysis of all consecutive severe trauma patients admitted to our regional trauma center from 2010 to 2013 was performed. All patients with an ISS ≥16 and a length of ICU stay ≥7 days were included. Main admission characteristics, injuries, transfusions and management were collected, as well as fluid therapy and mechanical ventilation during ICU stay. Patients were classified in conservative LFM group if they had at least two consecutive days with a negative fluid balance between Day 3 and Day 7; the other patients belonged in liberal LFM group. These two groups were compared, especially in terms of fluid balance and mechanical ventilation requirements.
