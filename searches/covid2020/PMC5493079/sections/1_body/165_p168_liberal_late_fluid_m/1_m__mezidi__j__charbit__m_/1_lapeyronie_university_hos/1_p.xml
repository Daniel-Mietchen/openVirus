 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Liberal late fluid management (LFM) was associated with a higher morbi-mortality in different critically ill populations. In trauma, restrictive fluid strategy is largely recommended early resuscitation phase, however LFM has not been really studied. The main goal of present study was to assess in a severe trauma population the impact of liberal LFM on mechanical ventilation duration.
