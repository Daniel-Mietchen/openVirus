 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Dehydration is a relatively unrecognized disorder in medical ICU especially among older patients. Our aim was to determine the incidence of dehydration upon admission as well as the risk of developing dehydration during hospitalization and its effect on patient outcome. Moreover, several lab parameters were studied in order to assess the correlation to the diagnosis.
