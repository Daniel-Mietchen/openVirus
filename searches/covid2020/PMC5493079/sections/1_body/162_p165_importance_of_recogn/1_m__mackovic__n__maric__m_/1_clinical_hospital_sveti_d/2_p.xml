 <bold>Methods:</bold> All patients entering ICU in a 6Â month period in 2015 were enrolled and screened for dehydration on day 1 and day 3 using clinical and lab parameters (BUN, Cr, BUN/Cr ratio, Hct, serum Na, urine specific gravity). BUN/Cr &gt;20 was used as a diagnostic criteria. Serum osmolality was not used due to unconsistent eligibility. In total of 332 patients, 38 were excluded due to GI haemorrhage. Finally, 294 patients were included, M/F 152/142, median age 74. Statistical methods used were McNemar test (differences in dehydration on day 1 and day 3), binary logistic analysis (association of lab parameters with dehydration) and multivariate adjusted binary logistic regression model (outcome).
