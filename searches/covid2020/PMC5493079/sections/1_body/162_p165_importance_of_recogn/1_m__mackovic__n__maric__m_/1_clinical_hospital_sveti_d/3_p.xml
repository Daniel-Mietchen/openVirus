 <bold>Results:</bold> Of 294 patients 126 (42.9 %) were dehydrated upon admission. Dehydration clinically diagnosed at admission and defined by BUN/Cr &gt;20 were significantly associated (McNemar test; χ 
 <sup>2</sup> = 42.01; n = 246; p &lt; 0.001; ϕ =0.24). Dehydration was correctly clinically recognised in 45/126 (35.7 %). Patients with BUN/Cr &gt;20 had 3 times higher odds to be accurately clinically diagnosed. No correlation could be found between dehydration and values of Hct, serum Na and urine specific gravity. Statistically significant positive association was demonstrated for BUN (OR = 1.08; 95 % CI 1.04-1.11; p &lt; 0.001) and Cr (OR = 1.00; 95 % CI 1.00-1.00; p = 0.048). On day 3 133/249 (54.1 %) patients were dehydrated which represents significant increase (McNemar test, χ 
 <sup>2</sup> with continuity correction = 7.01; n = 246; p = 0.008; ϕ = 0.45). Overall, dehydration at any point of stay was associated with adverse outcome (death) (OR
 <sub>adj</sub> = 2.45, 95%CI 1.38-4.34, p = 0.002).
