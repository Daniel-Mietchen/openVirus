 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Dehydration is a common finding in ICU and can be clinically easily overlooked due to insensitivity of clinicians for milder forms of dehydration which could explain a relatively high rate of misclassification. Clinical and lab parameters are insufficient for diagnosis which is consistent with previous observations. According to these data, hydration status changes during ICU stay and itâ€™s fluctuations are associated with increased mortality suggesting that maintaining an adequate hydration status is of core interest for patient outcome.
