 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> CIS helps in early recognition and intervention of critical disease, thus has an impact in decreasing mortality.In order to further decrease mortality, training is needed to increase compliance to the alert systems.However, septic shock alert protocolized over SIRS criteria seems to lead false positive diagnosis in one third of patients.This reveals the need for revising the sepsis and septic shock definition.
