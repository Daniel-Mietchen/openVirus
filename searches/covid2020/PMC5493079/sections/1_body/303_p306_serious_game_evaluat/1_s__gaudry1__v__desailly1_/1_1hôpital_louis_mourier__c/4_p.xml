<p id="Par2739">From September 2014 to June 2015, six secondary schools were included in the study. Two of them received a one-hour BLS session conducted by an intensivist assisted by 3 medical students. Sessions contained: a theoretical lecture and a practical simulation-based training using low-fidelity manikins (MiniAnnePlus®, Laerdal). Between 2 and 3 months later, both trained and non-trained students were assessed using a serious game reproducing real-life cardiac arrest situation (3D real-time simulation software, Stayingalive®, ILUMENS-Dassault system). Primary outcome was the time spent to complete the serious game (from onset of cardiac arrest to shock delivery and recovery). Secondary outcomes included knowledge of emergency call, hand placement during chest compressions and electrodes placement of automated external defibrillator.</p>
