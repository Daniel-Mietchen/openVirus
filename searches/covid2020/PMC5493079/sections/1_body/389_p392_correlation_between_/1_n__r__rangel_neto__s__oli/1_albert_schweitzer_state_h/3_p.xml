 <bold>Results:</bold> Of the 2974 patients, 54 % were male; mean age of 62 years old, mean SAPS III score of 63 points, SOFA score of 9 and 37,9 % of them died in the hospital. Univariate analysis showed a significantly higher risk of mortality in patients who developed metabolic acidosis plus hyperlactatemia (OR = 2,98, p-value 0.01). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that mixed metabolic acidosis plus respiratory acidosis (OR = 3.19, 95 % CI = 1.48-9.32, p-value = 0.001) and hyperlactatemia (OR = 1.78, 95 % CI = 0.49-4.56, p-value 0.02), patients with acidoses had very higher mortality (pH less then 7,2 44,1 % died and pH less then 7,05 95,5 % died; p 0.01 and p &lt; 0,001 respectively), patients with hyperlactatemia had higher mortality (arterial lactate over 2,5x regular levels 23,2,% died and arterial lactate over 5x regular levels 63,4,% died; p 0.05 and p 0,01 respectively) were two significant predictors of mortality, regardless of other confounding variables.
