 <bold>Methods:</bold> In this cross-sectional study, the medical data of all critically septic patients admitted to the Albert Schweitzer Hospital were reviewed between January 2013 and September 2015. Data including age, gender, SAPS III score upon admission, SOFA score, arrival and 24Â hour ABG and arterial lactate levels, as well as length of stay and in-hospital mortality rate were collected. A logistic regression model was used to determine the association between acid-base disturbance and lactate levels with in-hospital mortality after adjustment for potential confounding factors.
