 <bold>Results:</bold> Two-hundred healthcare practitioners were enrolled in mixed medical and surgical ICUs. Fifty-one ICU practitioners showed high prevalence association (25.5%). Physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists were equally presented at burnout association (p = 0.19). Age was associated with high burnout (p = 0.000), while gender was not. Empowerment was significantly associated with burnout by two-tailed test (p = 0.006). Positive empowerment had a negative effect on burnout variance (3.8%) when speculating practitioners’ burnout.
