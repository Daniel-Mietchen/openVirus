 <bold>Results:</bold> There were found 430 cases of Gram-negative rod monobacteremia, 77 (17.9 %) of them caused by Acinetobacter spp. There was no difference in gender, age, comorbidities, source of bacteremia, length of stay in intensive care unit for Acinetobacter spp. bacteremia (P &gt; 0.05). Primary bacteremia was associated with surgical procedures (OR = 4.677, P = 0.03) and previously treatment in other hospital departments (OR = 1.02, P = 0.04). Acinetobacter spp. strain was associated with high resistance to antibiotics (P &gt; 0.05), as: cefotaxim (n = 75, 97,4 %), ampicillin (n = 74, 96.1 %), cefuroxim and ceftazidim (n = 66, 85.7 %), gentamicin (n = 65, 84.4 %), piperacillin (n = 65, 84.4 %), piperacillin with tazobactam (n = 62, 80.5 %), ciprofloxacin (n = 59, 76.6 %), amikacin (n = 41, 53.2 %), ampicillin with sulbactam (n = 33, 42.9 %). The low resistance to carbapenems (n = 6, 7.8 %, P = 0.03) was estimated. Acinetobacter spp. strains were found to be mostly multi-drug-resistant, as resistant to &gt; = 3 classes of antibiotics (n = 74, 96.1 %, P = 0.02), especially in postoperative patients (n = 37, 92.5 %, OR = 4.042, P = 0.04) and previously treated in other hospital departments (n = 41, 100 %, OR = 4.701, P = 0.03). Overall mortality rate of Acinetobacter spp. bacteremia was 84.4 %. Lethal outcome was associated with mechanical ventilation (n = 65, 100 %, OR = 4.105, P = 0.05), multi-drug-resistant strain (n = 64, 98,5 %, OR = 1.182, P = 0.013), elderly (n = 36, 90 %, OR = 1.662, P = 0.016), resistance to cefalosporins (n = 57, 86.4 %, OR = 2.367, P = 0.04), and alcohol abuse (n = 9, 81.8 %, OR = 3.926, P = 0.05).
