 <bold>Results:</bold> Out of 405 patients, 79 (19,5%) patients were admitted with LSC limitation in the IdtCU. They presented with higher chronic and acute severity scores than unlimited patients. The most frequent admission diagnosis of LSC limited patients was acute respiratory failure (51,8% of patients). Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) use was frequent within this population (39%). Hospital mortality for LSC limited patients was high (53%) and associated with growing age -OR = 1,09 (1.02 - 1.15), preexisting organ failures or comorbidities -OR 7,34 (1.94 - 27.81)- elevated SOFA score -OR 1,36 (1.03 - 1.8)- and hypoxemic respiratory failure –OR 24,8 (3.52 – 175.3). Withdrawal of LSC was proceeded in 19, 5% of cases, with frequent terminal sedation with or without NIV retrieval (43, 8%).
