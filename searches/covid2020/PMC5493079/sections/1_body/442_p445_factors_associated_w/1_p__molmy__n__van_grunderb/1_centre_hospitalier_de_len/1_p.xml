 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Limitations of Life Supporting Care (LSC) and Withdrawal of LSC are scarcely studied in Intermediate Care Units (IdtCUs). We report prevalence of LSC limited patients in a medico-surgical Intermediate Care Unit over a six month period, with description, outcomes, and patterns of LSC Limitation and Withdrawal for such patients.
