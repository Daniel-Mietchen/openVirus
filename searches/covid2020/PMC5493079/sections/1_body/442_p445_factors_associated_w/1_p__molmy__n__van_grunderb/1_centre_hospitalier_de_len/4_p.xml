 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with limitations of LSC are frequently admitted in IdtCU. Hospital mortality is high and associated with age, acute and preexisting organ failures, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Life support withdrawal includes NIV terminal weaning and palliative sedation. LSC limited hypercapnic patients appear to be safely treated with NIV. The very high mortality of most severe patients raises questions on appropriateness of care and use of acute care resources.
