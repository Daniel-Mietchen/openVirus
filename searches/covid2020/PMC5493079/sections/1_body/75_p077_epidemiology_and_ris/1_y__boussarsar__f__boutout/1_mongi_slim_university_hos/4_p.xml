 <bold>Results:</bold> In the study period, 184 patients were admitted to the ICU, 67 (34,41 %) had ICU AI. From these 67 patients, 35 had an ESBL infection in 53 isolates, and 21 patients were infected with CPB isolated from 30 cultures. Global mortality in the study period was 44,59 %, the mortality associated to MDR infection was 51,16 %. In fact, mortality of ESBL infections was not so higher than the global one (48,57 %) whereas CPB infection weighed down mortality to reach 71,43 %. In the same way, length of stay was significantly longer in MDR infected patients (18,37 days ± 11.6 STD) than non-MDR infected ones (8,66 ± 4.60 STD, p &lt; 0,001). MV duration was respectively 15,85 days (±12,51 STD) in MDR group and 6,62 days (±5,10 STD, p &lt; 0,001) in the non-MDR infected group. Length of stay and duration of MV were found to be risk factors for acquiring MDR infection in ICU. Ventilator associated pneumonia was the most frequent acquired infection as well in non MDR infected patients as in both ESBL and CPB. Acinetobacter Baumannii was the leading isolate from CPB infection (60 %) followed by Klebsiella Pneumoniae (27 %). Concerning bacilli producing ESBL, Klebsiella Pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated (54,72 %) followed by Escherichia Coli and Enterobacter Cloacae (15,09 % each).
