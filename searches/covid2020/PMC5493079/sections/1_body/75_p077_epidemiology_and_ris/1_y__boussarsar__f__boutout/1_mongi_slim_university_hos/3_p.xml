 <bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective, case-control study including all patients admitted between January and October 2015. ICU AI were defined as those acquired no less than 48Â h after ICU admission. We did not include patients with no bacteriological evidence of infection. Differences in ICU mortality, length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) were tested across patients with and without ICU acquired MDR bacteria infections. We also assessed infected sites, most frequent bacteria for each group (ESBL and CPB), and looked for risk factors.
