 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The incidence of constipation on our unit is decreasing, however it remains a common problem, which seems to impact on establishing enteral feeding. As it can cause potentially serious complications in critical care patients, compliance with the guideline should be improved. We have changed policy to include starting prophylactic laxatives [2], unless contraindicated, in all new admissions with earlier escalation of treatment. Continued education and promotion of the new guideline is ongoing in our unit.
