 <bold>Results:</bold> Of the 37 patients included, 43 % suffered a period of constipation during their ICU stay. Treatment for patients who had not had their bowels opened for three consecutive days was initiated in only 44 % of patients. Treatment strategies for constipation varied and were partially or fully compliant with guidelines in only 37.5 % of constipated patients. Despite similar APACHE II scores and ages across the two groups, the incidence of a patient having at least one episode of failure to feed via the enteral route occurred in a higher proportion of constipated patients (69 %) compared with non-constipated patients (35 %).
