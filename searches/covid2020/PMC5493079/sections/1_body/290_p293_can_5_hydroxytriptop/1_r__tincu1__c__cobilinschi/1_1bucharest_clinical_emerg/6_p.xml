<p id="Par2627">At baseline, no significant differences were recorded regarding serotonin plasma levels (243 ± 47.75 and 252.6 ± 38.59 μ g/l, P &gt; 0.05) or age (55 ± 12.38 and 54.66 ± 12.11, P &gt; 0.05), in both groups. After the first determination we observed a decrease in serotonin levels in the placebo group (184.46 ± 37.57) and in 5-HTP group (229.26 ± 39.35) (p &lt; 0.001, T-value is 3.18). Delirium was present in 3 patients in the placebo group and 1 patient in 5-HTP group. After 14 days, serotonin levels were lower in the placebo group when compared to treatment group (P &lt; 0.001), and delirium was absent in the latter. Mean end points for Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale were higher in placebo group when compared to treatment group (P = 0.006), at the same time.</p>
