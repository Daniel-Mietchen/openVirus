<p id="Par2625">We conducted a randomized controlled trial on 30 patients, hospitalized in our ICU for non-surgery causes. We dosed serotonin levels on admission day, at 7 and at 14 days. Patients with psychiatric disorders and malignancies were excluded as those who were in treatment with drugs that interfere with the metabolism of serotonin. Selected patients were randomly assigned either to receive placebo treatment (first group, N = 30) or to received 300 mg of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) (second group, N = 30). Psychiatric evaluation was performed using the Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale.</p>
