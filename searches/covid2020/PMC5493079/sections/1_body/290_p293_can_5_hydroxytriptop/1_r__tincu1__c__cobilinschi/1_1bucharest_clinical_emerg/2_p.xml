<p id="Par2623">Long-term hospitalized patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are at high risk of developing major depressive syndrome or Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PSD). There are correlations between the degree of depression and survival in these patients. The incidence of depression and PSD is three times higher in patients in intensive care compared with the general population. 5-hydroxytryptophan, a precursor of serotonin, can be used for the prevention of depression in these patients.</p>
