<p id="Par2861">Anoxicâ€“ischemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest is a common cause of coma requiring intensive care of survivors. Certain malignant electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis. Neuron specific enolase (NSE) released after cardiac arrest is regarded as a severity indicator of postanoxic neuronal injury. We investigated the EEG findings in post-cardiac arrest patients and correlated these findings with NSE levels and outcome scales.</p>
