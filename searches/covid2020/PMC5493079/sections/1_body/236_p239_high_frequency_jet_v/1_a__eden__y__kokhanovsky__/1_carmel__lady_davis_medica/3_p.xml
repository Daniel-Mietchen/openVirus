 <bold>Results:</bold> 47 patients received HFJV (35 males, age 58 ± 18, BMI 26.4 ± 4.2, APACHE II 24.4 ± 8.8). Baseline (BL) Vt, PEEP and peak pressure were 7.4 ± 1.5 ml/kgpbw, 12 ± 3 and 32 ± 6 cmH[sub]2[/sub]O Respectively. At BL 8 were in prone position and 10 received NO. During HFJV 3 remained in prone position and 8 received NO. One patient was converted to ECMO and 2 patients were weaned from ECMO to HFJV (data not shown). Over the first 24 hours of HFJV oxygenation improved significantly at all time points (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig57" ref-type="fig">57</xref>) while PaCO[sub]2[/sub] decreased from 52 ± 11 to 41 ± 10 (P &lt; 0.001). pH increased (7.30 ± 0.1 to 7.40 ± 0.1, P &lt; 0.001) while MAWP (22 ± 5 to 19 ± 5 cmH[sub]2[/sub]O P = 0.03) and lactate (1.9 ± 1.2 to 1.8 ± 1.0 mM/L, p = 0.6) did not change. During the first 24 hours oxygenation improved in 41 patients. HFJV was continued for a median of 5 (IQR 2,7) days. 30 of the patients survived to hospital discharge.
