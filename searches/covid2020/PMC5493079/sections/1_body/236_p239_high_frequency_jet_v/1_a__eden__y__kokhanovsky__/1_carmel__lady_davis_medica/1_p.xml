 <bold>Introduction:</bold> High frequency ventilation has theoretical advantages for the management of ARDS, however, high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) did not improve outcome [1]. High frequency jet ventilation (HFJV), unlike HFOV allows for spontaneous ventilatory efforts. We report our experience with HFJV in patients with severe hypoxemia over a 10Â year period.
