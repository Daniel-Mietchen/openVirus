 <bold>Methods:</bold> HFJV (Monsoon, Acutronic Medical Systems, Hirzel, Switzerland) was superimposed upon low rate (6/min) low volume (100-200 ml) SIMV. Patients who required FiO[sub]2[/sub] &gt; 0.5 and PEEP &gt; 10 cmH[sub]2[/sub]O or those with bronchopleural fistula were candidates for HFJV. Patients were excluded if air trapping was evident on expiratory flow curve or the machine was unavailable (1 unit only). In all patients intratracheal mean airway pressure (MAWP) was measured continuously. Parameters were compared over time using ANOVA (p &lt; 0.01 significant).
