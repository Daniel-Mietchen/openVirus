 <bold>Results:</bold> sBTLA levels were statistically significantly increased in the sepsis cohort compared to ICU controls and blood donors. The overall 28 day mortality was 18 %. sBTLA levels were statistically significantly higher at the time of study inclusion and until 48 hours in 28 day sepsis non-survivors than in survivors, and did not change over time. 28 day mortality was 5-fold higher in patients with a baseline plasma sBTLA &gt; 21 ng/mL compared to those with a level lower than 9 ng/mL (HR 5.0, 95 % CI 1.3-18, p = 0.02), but there was no increased risk for death for patients with intermediate (10-21 ng/mL) compared to low baseline sBTLA (HR 1.2, 95 % CI 0.2-5.8, p = 0.8).
