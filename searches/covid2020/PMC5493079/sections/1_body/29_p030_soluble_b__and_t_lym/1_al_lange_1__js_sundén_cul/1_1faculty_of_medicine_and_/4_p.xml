 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Plasma concentrations of soluble BTLA were increased in severe sepsis/septic shock compared to in patients with non-infectious critical illness and healthy controls, and did not change significantly over the first 48 hours after study inclusion. A baseline sBTLA concentration &gt;21 ng/mL was a negative prognostic indicator.
