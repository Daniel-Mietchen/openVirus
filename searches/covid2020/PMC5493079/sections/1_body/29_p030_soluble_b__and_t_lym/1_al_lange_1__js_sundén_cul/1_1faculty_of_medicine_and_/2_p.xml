 <bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective observational study was conducted in the mixed intensive care unit of Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden. 101 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (sepsis cohort) and 28 patients with non-infectious critical illness (ICU controls) were included. 31 blood donors served as healthy controls. Blood samples taken on enrollment and at 24 and 48Â hours were included in the analysis. Plasma concentration of sBTLA was measured with Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Patients were followed from inclusion until day 28 or the day of death. Prognostic capacity of sBTLA was evaluated on a categorical scale (the patients were divided into three categories with the same number of subjects, based on the concentration of sBTLA) with Cox Regression and adjusted for age. Comparison of plasma concentrations between survivors and non-survivors was made with the Mann-Whitney U test.
