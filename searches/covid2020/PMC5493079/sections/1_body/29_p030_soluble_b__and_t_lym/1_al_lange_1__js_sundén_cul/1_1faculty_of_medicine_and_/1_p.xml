 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Upregulation of the expression of negative co-stimulatory molecules on T-cells is one of the mechanisms behind immunoparalysis in sepsis. We wanted to evaluate the prognostic capacity of the soluble isoform of the negative co-stimulatory receptor soluble B- and T-lymphocyte Attenuator (sBTLA) in severe sepsis and septic shock.
