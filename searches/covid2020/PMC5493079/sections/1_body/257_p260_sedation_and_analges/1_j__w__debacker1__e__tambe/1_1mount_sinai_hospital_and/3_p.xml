 <bold>Results:</bold> (INTERIM) 23 adults (19 males, 48 ± 11 years, APACHE II 31 ± 5) with severe ARDS (P/F 72 ± 19), mainly from pulmonary sepsis (91 %), were treated with VV-ECMO from Jan 2012-July 2014. Median duration of VV-ECMO was 9 days (IQR 5-11). At 48 hr post ECMO initiation all patients were deeply sedated (SAS[&lt;=]3), with 96 % and 100 % receiving a sedative (midazolam 87 %, propofol 26 %) and opioid (fentanyl 91 %) infusion respectively. Within 24 hr prior to ECMO discontinuation, in patients who survived ECMO (78 %), 44 % of patients were still deeply sedated. At this time, 89 % were receiving sedatives (67 % infusion vs 22 % intermittent) and 83 % were receiving opioids (72 % infusion vs 11 % intermittent). At 48 hr post ECMO discontinuation 83 % of patients reached light levels of sedation (SAS &gt; 3). At this time point only 61 % were still receiving sedatives (33 % infusion vs 29 % intermittent) and 50 % were receiving opioids (33 % infusion vs 17 % intermittent); 22 % were not receiving any sedative or opioid. While on ECMO 57 % of patients had cisatracurium infusions for a median duration of 16 hrs (IQR 10-76). 88 % had [&gt;=]1 positive CAM-ICU score for delirium. Haloperidol and quetiapine were the primary antipsychotics used throughout ECMO (30 % and 57 % respectively). 57 % of patients underwent physical therapy within a median of 5 days of starting ECMO (IQR 3-7), yet the majority (62 %) achieved only passive range of motion in bed during ECMO.
