 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with ARDS were deeply sedated with midazolam and fentanyl infusions after VV-ECMO initiation. Patients transitioned from deep to light levels of sedation around the time of ECMO discontinuation with many receiving sedation and analgesia via intermittent bolus or not at all. Few patients were actively mobilized during ECMO treatment.
