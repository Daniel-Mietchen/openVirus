 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Results suggest that relatives are satisfied with the care that their relatives received at the trust. The results appear to correlate well with those from the FS-ICU in several domains such as care, communication and empathy. We therefore propose that the CCFNI can be used as an alternative annual survey to measure relatives experience on ICU.
