 <bold>Introduction:</bold> We sought to evaluate whether the succinct Critical Care Family Needs Inventory (CCFNI) [1], a validated survey, may serve as a suitable alternative to the FS-ICU. Undertaking relative experience surveys annually was outlined as a quality indicator by the Scottish Intensive Care Society Quality Improvement Group in 2012. Over the past 5 years we have completed the FS-ICU annually. This is a lengthy survey covering aspects of care &amp; decision making. The FSS has been previously validated in large US/Canadian studies [2]. More recently the Family Reported Experiences Evaluation (FREE) validated the FS-ICU in the UK, employing the survey across 20 different ICUs with approximately 7000 forms completed.
