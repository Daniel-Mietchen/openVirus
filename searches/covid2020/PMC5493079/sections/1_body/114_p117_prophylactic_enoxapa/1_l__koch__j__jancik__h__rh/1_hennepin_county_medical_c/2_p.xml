 <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients admitted to the burn unit between November 2009 and July 2015 with an appropriately measured anti-Xa level were examined through retrospective chart review. Levels were considered appropriate if drawn 3-5 hours after at least three consecutive enoxaparin doses. Anti-Xa levels ranging from 0.1-0.4U/mL were considered to be within the goal prophylactic range. Patient demographics and injury data including age, sex, admission weight, and burn percentage of total body surface area (%TBSA) were documented. The incidence of VTE and adverse events, including bleeding events attributed to enoxaparin, were also recorded.
