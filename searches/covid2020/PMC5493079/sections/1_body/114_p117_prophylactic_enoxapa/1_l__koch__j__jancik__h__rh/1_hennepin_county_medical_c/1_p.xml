 <bold>Introductions:</bold> The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acute burn patients has been reported to range from 0.4Â %-23%. [1] Standard enoxaparin prophylaxis dosing has been shown to provide anti-Xa levels below goal in a significant proportion of burn patients, resulting in a potential increase in thrombotic risk. [2] The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of standard prophylaxis enoxaparin dosing within an inpatient burn unit and identify patient characteristics associated with lower initial anti-Xa levels.
