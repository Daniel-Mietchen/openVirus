 <bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-three acute burn injury patients treated with enoxaparin had at least one measured anti-Xa level during admission. Only 21 of these patients (63.6 %) had an initial anti-Xa level within the specified goal range. An additional 6 patients (18.2 %) were initially subtherapeutic, but achieved therapeutic levels with dose adjustment, while 4 patients (12.1 %) never had a measured anti-Xa within goal range prior to the discontinuation of enoxaparin or before discharge. The median enoxaparin dose required to achieve goal anti-Xa levels was 40 mg every 12 hours. Patients with an initial therapeutic level had an average burn size of 23.2 % TBSA and mean admission weight of 106.7 kg, while those with an initial subtherapeutic level had an average burn size of 40 % TBSA and mean admission weight of 114.1 kg. There was one VTE event among the study population, occurring in a patient with therapeutic anti-Xa levels. There were no documented bleeding events leading to the discontinuation of enoxaparin in any of the study participants.
