 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Hemato-oncological patients with neutropenic sepsis or septic shock are a growing concern in oncological Intensive Care Units (ICU). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) are used to predict prognosis in critical patients based in clinical and analytic criteria obtained in the first 24Â hours after admission. Through this study we aim to analyse which factors predict mortality in a cohort of febrile neutropenic (FN) patients with haematological malignancies.
