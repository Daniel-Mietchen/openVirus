 <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 54 patients were included for analysis. The median age at admission was 48 years and 51.9 % were male (N = 28). The baseline cause of immunosuppression was Alogeneic Stem Cell Transplant (N = 20) and recent Chemotherapy (N = 34). The SAPS II and APACHE II scores had a median of 64 and 28.5, respectively. Multiple organ dysfunction was observed in 79.63 % of cases (N = 43). The single more frequent dysfunctions were respiratory, in 94.44 % (N = 51), renal, in 62.96 % (N = 34), and cardiovascular dysfunction, in 57.40 % of patients (N = 31). Renal replacement therapy was required in 11 cases. Invasive ventilation was performed in 81.48 % of patients (N = 44), with median duration of 168 hours. The median ICU length of stay was 8 days. In-ICU mortality was 31.48 % (N = 17). In univariate analysis, the APACHE II (OR 1.279, p value &lt;0.01), SAPS II (OR 1.082, p value &lt;0.01), renal dysfunction (OR 3.403, p value &lt;0.05) and invasive ventilation (IV) (OR 8.7, p value &lt;0.20) were associated with in-ICU mortality. In a multivariate analysis, APACHE II remained statistically significant (OR 1.546, p value 0.018, AUC 0.84) as IV in an exact logistic analysis.
