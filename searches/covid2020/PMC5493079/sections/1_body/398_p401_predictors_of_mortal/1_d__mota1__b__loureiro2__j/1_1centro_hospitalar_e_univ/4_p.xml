 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> A high APACHE II score and IV seems to predict an elevated mortality risk in ICU patients with FN and haematological malignancies. SAPS II appears to be a less important predictor of mortality in this setting. However, it should be noted that the scores shouldnâ€™t be used to ascertain prognosis in individual cases.
