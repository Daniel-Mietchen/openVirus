<p id="Par3283">A case- control study was conducted at Loghman Hakim Hospital between March 2013 and March 2014. Among 300 poisoned patients with mechanical ventilator &gt; =48 hours, 150 patients who developed microbiologically-confirmed VAP were considered as VAP group and 150 without VAP were defined as control group. The data were collected by age, sex, type of poisoning, GCS, APACHE II score, length of hospital stay, previous antibiotic use, microbial culture of the trachea, body temperature, leukocyte count, and patients’ outcome. Based on the type of poisoning, patients were divided in 3 groups that included opioid (opium, heroin and methadone), CNS depressants (Antidepressant, Benzodiazepine and anti-convulsive) and other such as pesticide, methanol, 3, 4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and multi drugs. All data were expressed as mean (SD) for continuous variable and frequency for categorical variables. Logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between risk factors and VAP.</p>
