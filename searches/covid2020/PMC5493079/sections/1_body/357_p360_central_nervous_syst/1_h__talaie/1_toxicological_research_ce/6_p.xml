<p id="Par3285">Mean age of the patients was 33.9 ± 14.3 years. The probable VAP incidence and mortality were 22 % and 18.6 %, respectively. CNS depressant versus opioid (odds ratio, 3.74; p &lt; .027), APACHE II (odds ratio, 1.28; p &lt; .000) and Hospital length of stay (odds ratio, 2.15; p &lt; .000) were the independent risk factor for VAP. While, APACHE II score (odds ratio, 1.12; p &lt; .044) and Hospital length of stay (odds ratio, 2.15; p &lt; .000) were the independent predictors of VAP mortality among these patients. The most common microorganisms in VAP cases were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Acinetobacter sp in order to 56.7 % and 12.7.</p>
