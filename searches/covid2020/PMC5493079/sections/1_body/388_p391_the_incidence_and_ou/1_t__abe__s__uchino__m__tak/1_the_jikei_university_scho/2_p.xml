 <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective observational study was conducted in the PACU of a university hospital in Tokyo, Japan from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. Adult PACU patients who were monitored with the arterial catheter after elective surgery were included, except for patients with no lactate measured within 3 hours after PACU admission. We measured serum lactate levels in arterial blood samples using a point-of-care device. Study patients were divided to three groups according to maximum lactate levels in the first 24 hours of the PACU stay; normal lactate (&lt;2 mmol/L), moderate hyperlactatemia (2-3.9 mmol/L) and severe hyperlactatemia (&gt; = 4 mmol/L). The primary outcome was the composite outcome consisted of in-hospital mortality, re-admission to the PACU or admission to the ICU, and emergency reoperation during the same hospital stay.
