 <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 5362 patients were included in the study. Among these patients, 3421 (63.8 %) patients had normal lactate, 1642 (30.6 %) had moderate and 299 (5.6 %) had severe hyperlactatemia. The composite outcome occurred in 333 (6.2 %) of all patients. The incidence rate of the composite outcome increased as serum lactate levels elevated (normal: 4.7 %, moderate: 7.9 %, severe: 14.1 %, normal vs. moderate: [i]p[/i] &lt;0.001, moderate vs. severe: [i]p[/i] &lt;0.001). In-hospital mortality, re-admission to the PACU or admission to the ICU, and emergency reoperation occurred in 71 (1.3 %), 190 (3.5 %), and 168 (3.1 %) for all patients, respectively. Each primary outcome tended to increase with elevated serum lactate levels. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that moderate and severe hyperlactatemia were risk factors for the composite outcome, odds ratio: 1.56 (1.20 - 2.01) for moderate hyperlactatemia, 1.57 (1.01 - 2.43) for severe hyperlactatemia referred to normal lactate.
