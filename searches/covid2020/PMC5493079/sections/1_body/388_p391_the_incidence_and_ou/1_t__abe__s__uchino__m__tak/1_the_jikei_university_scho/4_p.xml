 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The incidence of hyperlactatemia in the PACU was 36.2Â % after elective surgery. Although hyperlactatemia was independently associated with poor outcome, severe hyperlactatemia was only similarly associated with poor outcome compared with moderate hyperlactatemia. Further studies, especially for causes of hyperlactatemia in the PACU, will be clarified.
