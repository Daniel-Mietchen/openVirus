<p id="Par3056">This is a multi-centre retrospective cohort study conducted at four Canadian academic tertiary care centres. Population: All adult aSAH patients admitted to the study hospitals from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013. Patients were identified from hospital administrative discharge records and existing local SAH databases. The diagnosis was confirmed by presence of blood in the subarachnoid space (on either imaging or lumbar puncture) due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm (as demonstrated on any of angiography, neuro-imaging or autopsy). Data Collection: Trained abstractors collected demographic data, aSAH characteristics, daily hemoglobin concentrations and nadir hemoglobin, other major aSAH co-interventions, and outcomes using a pre-tested case report form in reference to a standardized operations manual.</p>
