 <bold>Results:</bold> One hundred patients (out of 783 screened) were enrolled in the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients were assigned into groups: NP + ARDS (n = 55, 45 ± 5.1 years old, M/F 50/5, mortality 29,0 %) and NP (n = 45, 42 ± 5.8 years old, M/F 41/4, mortality 26,6 %). Groups were comparable in APACHE II and SOFA scores on the baseline. In the NP + ARDS group SPD was higher at all points than in the NP group. Plasma SPD on day 0 &gt; 111.2 ng/ml yielded a sensitivity of 68.2 % and specificity of 92.3 % (AUC 0.85; 95 % CI 0.684-0.945; p &lt; 0.0001) for diagnosing ARDS in NP. A complex ROC analysis (SPD + P/F ratio &lt;280 + EVLWI &gt;8.3 ml/kg) yielded a better diagnostic accuracy of SPD: cutoff &gt;93.7 ng/ml, sensitivity 81.0 %, specificity 100.0 % (AUC 0.96; 95 % CI 0.817-0.998; p &lt; 0.0001). SPA on day 0 is not informative for ARDS diagnosis (SPA &gt; 36.2 ng/ml, sensitivity of 51.2 %, specificity of 92.3 %, AUC 0.61; 95 % CI 0.474-0.745; p &lt; 0.1168). Plasma SPA was significantly lower in survived versus died patients with ARDS. Plasma SPA on day 0 &gt; =18,6 ng/ml yielded a sensitivity of 88,9 % and specificity of 72 &gt; 7 % for prediction of mortality in ARDS patients on day 5-6 of ICU stay (AUC 0.86; 95 % CI 0.685-0.962; p &lt; 0,0001).
