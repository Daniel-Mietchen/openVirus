 <bold>Results:</bold> Total of 2053 and 2432 patients were admitted with ICU days being 6460 and 6193 pre and post eICU respectively. Baseline demographics and patient profile in two groups did not show statistically significant difference. Mean APACHE II was 16.48 ± 6.81 [SMR (standardized mortality ratio) 0.71 ± 0.14] vs 16.82 ± 7.12 (SMR 0.49 ± 0.16). ALOS was 3.14 ± 2.39 vs 2.55 ± 2.45 days pre and post eICU respectively indicating a reduction of ~ 19% which is significant (p &lt; 0.01). Nosocomial infection incidence per thousand device days post eICU came down from 16.4 to 6.31 (decrease of ~ 62%). Financial impact from reduced ALOS was INR 28.7 million which is significant compared to the eICU cost borne by the unit of INR 2.4 million.
