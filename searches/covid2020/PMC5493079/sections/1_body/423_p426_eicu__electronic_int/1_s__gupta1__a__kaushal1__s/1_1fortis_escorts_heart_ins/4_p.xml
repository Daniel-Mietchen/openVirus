 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> eICU has been judged as a cost centre by most administrators but if we look at the above case study then it’s clear that in developing country like India not only it’s cost effective but also made a significant decrease in ALOS along with mortality and nosocomial infection. This leads to a direct impact of financials on patients and the hospital. By mobilizing shorter turnovers we can help in treating more patients without escalating cost by building new beds which will never have adequate manpower and resources.
