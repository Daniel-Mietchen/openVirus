 <bold>Methods:</bold> We enrolled 5 intubated patients who were admitted to our Intensive Care Unit at the Saint Antony Hospital of Padua; a Nutrivent nasogastric tube was placed in each to measure the diaphragm contractility as the transdiaphragmatic pressure (ÄPdi) with the following formula: ÄPdi = gastric pressure-esophageal pressure. We performed a diaphragmatic sonography with the M-mode technique. We calculated the diaphragm contraction speed as the slope (Scdi) of the curve provided by the diaphragm contraction during the inspiratory phase of the spontaneous breathing trials. The correlation between the mean ÄPdi and the mean Scdi was evaluated using the Pearson’s method according with a linear regression analysis.
