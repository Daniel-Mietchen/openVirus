 <bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 667 patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery procedures under the use of CPB in our department during a 2 years period were retrospectively studied. The lowest value of hemoglobulin (Nadir Hb) throughout CPB was recorded. Group A consisted of patients with Hb &lt; 7 g/dl, while group B was the control group. The following perioperative outcome indices were compared between 2 groups: Increase of Lactate (Lac) value at the end of CPB, acute kidney injury (AKI) defined by RIFLE criteria, postoperative use of non invasive ventilation (NIV), prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;48 hours), perioperative infarction (PMI), stroke, total red blood transfusion &gt; 3units, atrial fibrillation(AF) and mortality. Statistical analysis was based on chi-square test.
