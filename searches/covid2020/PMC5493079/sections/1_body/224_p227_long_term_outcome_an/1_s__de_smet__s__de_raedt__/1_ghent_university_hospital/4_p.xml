 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Long-term survival in patients selected for PMV with tracheostomy after failure to wean was not significantly different from that of weaned patients with tracheostomy. This suggests that survival of these patients depends more on the underlying disease(s) than on the ventilation itself. Despite the physical QoL scores being low in both groups, mental QoL was still acceptable.
