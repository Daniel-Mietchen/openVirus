 <bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively investigated post-ICU trajectories and survival in patients admitted at the medical ICU of a tertiary center between 1999 and 2013. Only patients requiring tracheostomy for respiratory failure of varying etiology and difficult weaning were included. Patients were discriminated between those who did or did not require ventilation at ICU discharge. Patient characteristics affecting survival rates were examined. QoL assessment was done in survivors using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency (SRI) questionnaire in 2014.
