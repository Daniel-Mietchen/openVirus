 <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 114 patients was included, of whom 59 required mechanical ventilation at ICU discharge and 55 were weaned from ventilation at that point. One-year survival rates were 73 % and 69 %, respectively. In patients with a follow-up of at least five years, 5-years survival rates were 40 % (16/40) for ventilated and 42 % (14/33) for weaned patients. In the ventilated group, survival rates were significantly lower in the elderly (p = 0.001) and in patients with a high Charlson Comorbidity Index (p = 0.02) or chronic kidney disease (p &lt; 0.001). QoL was assessed in 21 ventilated and 22 weaned patients after a median of 58 and 52 months. Response rates were 84 % and 81 %, respectively. Overall, QoL scores for physical functioning were low in both groups. QoL for physical functioning, assessed with SF-36, was lower in the ventilated (8/100) than in the weaned group (20/100). Scores for social functioning and mental health were less below norm and similar between both groups (62 and 52/100 vs. 62 and 48/100, respectively). A similar trend was observed with the SRI questionnaire.
