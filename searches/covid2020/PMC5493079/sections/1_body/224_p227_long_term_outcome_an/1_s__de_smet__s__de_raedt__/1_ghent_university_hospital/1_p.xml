 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Long-term outcome and quality-of-life (QoL) in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) after failure to wean is scarcely documented. However, due to improvements of respiratory care in the ICU, an increasing amount of patients requires PMV. This study evaluates long-term survival and QoL in patients treated by tracheostomy for difficult weaning, with or without need for PMV at ICU discharge.
