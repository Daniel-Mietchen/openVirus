<p id="Par2765">The proportion of volunteers who managed to deliver ventilation during CPR was higher (p &lt; 0,0001) in guided groups (81,2 % for U-G group and 83,3 % for T-G group) than in unguided groups (0 % for U-NG group and 46,1 % for T-NG group). While the tidal volume delivered was too high for each group, the fraction of time required to give ventilations was significant higher for guided groups.</p>
