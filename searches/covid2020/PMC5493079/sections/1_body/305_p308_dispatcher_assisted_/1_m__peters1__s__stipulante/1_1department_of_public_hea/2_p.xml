<p id="Par2759">Pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a devastating event with low survival rates, partly due to lack of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (1). While telephone dispatcher-assisted CPR instructions (T-CPR) improve the frequency and quality of bystander CPR for OHCA in adults (2), this support remains undeveloped in pediatry. We aim to assess the effectiveness of a new pediatric T-CPR protocol in both previously trained and untrained bystanders, and secondarily, the utility of the ventilations.</p>
