<p id="Par2972">Animals were randomly assigned to sham-, ischemia-, sham plus (+) RIPoC- and ischemia + RIPoC-groups. RIPoC was induced by three cycles of 5 min and 10 min occlusion-reperfusion of both femoral arteries at predetermined points in time ( 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after transient cerebral ischemia). CV staining, F-J B histofluorescence staining and NeuN immunohistochemistry were carried out to examine neuroprotection in the RIPoC-mediated hippocampus 5 days after ischemia-reperfusion.</p>
