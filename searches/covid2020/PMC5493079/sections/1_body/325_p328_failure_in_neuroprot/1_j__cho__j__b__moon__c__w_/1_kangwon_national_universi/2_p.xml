<p id="Par2970">Remote ischemic post conditioning (RIPoC) has been proven to provide potent protection of the heart and brain against ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, despite the evidence of cerebral protection with RIPoC is compelling, RIPoC-mediated neuroprotection against transient cerebral ischemic damage insult is still mired in controversy. In this study, we examined the effect of RIPoC induced by sublethal transient hind limb ischemia neuronal death in the hippocampus following 5Â min of transient cerebral ischemia in gerbils.</p>
