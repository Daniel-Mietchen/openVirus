<p id="Par2974">In the ischemia-group, we found a significant loss of pyramidal neurons in the stratum pyramidale (SP) of the hippocampal CA1 region at 5 days post-ischemia compared with the sham-group. In all of the ischemia + RIPoC-groups, the loss of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region at 5 days post-ischemia was not different from that in the ischemia-group.</p>
