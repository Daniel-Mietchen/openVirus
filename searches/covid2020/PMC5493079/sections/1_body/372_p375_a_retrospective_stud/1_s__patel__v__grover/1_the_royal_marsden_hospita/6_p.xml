<p id="Par3449">Twenty-nine patients (19 male) received DEX in the study period (age range 19-82 years). The median length of stay was 19.6 days (interquartile range (IQR) 13.0-26.3) as a result of prolonged mechanical ventilation (median 15.8 days (IQR 8.0-23.0). Nineteen patients survived to ICU discharge. Eighteen patients (61.1 %) required a tracheostomy, with a median duration of 18 days (IQR 10.5-19.77). DEX was used to facilitate sedation reduction in those patients who were difficult to wean, manage agitation and delirium and to expedite extubation/decannulation. It was utilised for a median of 79 hours (IQR 144-47) with a median dose of 0.91 micrograms/kg/hr (IQR 0.57-1.13). It was deemed to have improved the defined outcomes for 12 patients (41 %). Bradycardia and/or hypotension was observed in 17 patients within 4-hr of DEX treatment, almost half required support. The mean cost of DEX treatment was £630 per patient. This approximates to £1500 per patient with clinical benefit. This cost was offset by the reduction of sedation (11 patients) in those patients with difficult to manage agitation with other agents, as well as ventilator weaning, earlier extubation and avoidance of tracheostomy (10 patients).</p>
