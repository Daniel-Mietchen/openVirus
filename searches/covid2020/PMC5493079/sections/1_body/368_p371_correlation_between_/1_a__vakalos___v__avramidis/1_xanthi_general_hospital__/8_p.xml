<p id="Par3412">According to our data, there was no statistically significant correlation detected between percentages of ventilated patients developed VAP and use of Midazolam, Propofol and Cisatracurium. On the other hand, not all but some patients had increased demand for more sedative agents. Our data suggest that the percentages of ventilated patients developed VAP is independent from the use of main sedative and neuromuscular blockage agents in all ICU ventilated patients. </p>
