<p id="Par3408">From January 2008 to December 2012 admitted to our ICU 384 patients. From our database we looked for percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP as well as the use of the following agents as items per ventilation day per ventilated patient: Midazolame (amp 50 mg), Propofol (vial 2 % 50 ml), Sisatracurium (amp 5 ml/10mg) per year from 2008 to 2012. Using linear correlation method, we looked for linear slope, correlation coefficient (r), and coefficient of determination (r2), and by linear regression method using ANOVA test we looked for p value, according percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP and use of Midazolam, Propofol and Sisatracurium.</p>
