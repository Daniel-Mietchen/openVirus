 <bold>Results:</bold> The overall response rate was 66%, with a male-female ratio of .47. The mean age of the respondents was 43.4 years, mean working hours/weeks rated 33.6, and 54% finished A-levels in education. ICU HCP scored the same on vigor, higher on dedication (p &lt; .05), and lower on absorption (p &lt; .05) compared to the average Dutch employee. They reported no more stress related symptoms such as mental distance and sleeping disorders. Although only 2.8% of the ICU HCP assessed workload as high, compared to 3.6%, the emotional burden scored higher (3.1 and 1.8 in respective, p &lt; .05). General HCP acted as benchmark in empathic ability. ICU HCP showed an equal score on the cognitive component (3.9 compared to 4.0) and a lower score on the emotional component (3.0 compared to 3.8, p &lt; .05). Mean cognitive empathy is positively correlated with vigor (r = .21) although both cognitive and emotional empathy did not correlate with work engagement.
