 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Workload at the ICU may be high, but seemed not too hard for the respondents. It is assumable that workload, with the emotional high burden, is acknowledged as an integral part of ICU work. ICU HCP understand the patients and relatives, but remain at a certain distance emotionally. The results of this study suggested no influence on work engagement by empathic ability.
