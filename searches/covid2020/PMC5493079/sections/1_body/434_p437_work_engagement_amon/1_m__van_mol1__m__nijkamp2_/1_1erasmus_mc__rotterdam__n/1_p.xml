 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Work-related stress with the accompanying emotions provoked specifically in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is well documented over the previous years. The high-stakes, high stress environment that ICU health care professionals (HCP) practice in, are demanding intellectually, physically, and emotionally. Work engagement has been operationalized as a positive work-related state of mind and characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption. The aim of the study is to explore the influence of personal resources, e.g. empathic ability on work engagement among the ICU HCP.
