 <bold>Results:</bold> In 1836 patients who survived to hospital discharge median duration of hospitalization was 7 days (IQR: 4-11) and 11 days (6-25) in those patients who had post-operative AKI. In all hospital survivors mean eGFR rose significantly from baseline to discharge: 88.4 to 94.7 ml/min/1.73 m
 <sup>2</sup> (p &lt; 0.001). However in those with AKI discharge eGFR was similar to baseline 76.4 to 74.5 (p = 0.6). 1225 patients stayed &gt; =5 days after surgery in those with AKI mean creatinine rose rapidly and eventually settled to near baseline however overall creatinine fell progressively in the five days after surgery and was ~10 % below baseline at discharge (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig46" ref-type="fig">46</xref>). In a regression analysis a higher discharge eGFR significantly correlated with longer hospital length of stay (p &lt; 0.001), however no such relationship existed for baseline eGFR (p = 0.79).
