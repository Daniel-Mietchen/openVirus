 <bold>Introduction:</bold> We have demonstrated that even mild and transient perioperative acute kidney injury is associated with significantly worse survival in the year after major surgery (see accompanying abstract). However, confounding effects of major illness on serum creatinine levels may cause severity of AKI to be underestimated and recovery from AKI over-estimated [1].
