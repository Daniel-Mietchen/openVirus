 <bold>Results:</bold> Vibrating mesh nebulizers (PDDS, CVMN) achieved higher delivered doses than ultrasonic (4 %) and jet (11 %) nebulizers. The delivered dose of AIS post-ET tube was higher with the PDDS vs CVMN (57 % vs 19 % of nominal). Up to 60 % of AIS was collected in the expiratory filter with the CVMN vs 3 % for the PDDS. The CVMN had improved deposition (up to 29 %) at the extra locations relative to IFU position but this was still lower than with the PDDS (Fig.
