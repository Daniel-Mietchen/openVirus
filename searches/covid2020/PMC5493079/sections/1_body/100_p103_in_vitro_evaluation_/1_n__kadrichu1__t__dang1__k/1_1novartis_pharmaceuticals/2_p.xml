 <bold>Methods:</bold> Delivery of AIS (400 mg; 3.2 mL of 125 mg/mL) was compared for the PDDS vs commercially available jet, ultrasonic or conventional vibrating mesh nebulizers (CVMN). Each was tested at the ventilator location specified in its Instructions for Use (IFU). The CVMN was tested at 4 further positions. Except for the CVMN pre-humidifier, tests were performed without humidification.
