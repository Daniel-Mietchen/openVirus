 <bold>Results:</bold> The Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that the preop presence of SPS independently predicts poorer survival in addition to previously known risk factors. The five year survival for all patients was (mean ± 95 % CI) 90.0 ± 1.2 %,. Survival for patients with SPS defined by the equation pair CAPA-LMrev was 58.8 ± 9.0 %. Survival for patients with SPS by the equation pair CKD-EPIcystatin C-creatinine was 65.1 ± 0.6 %.
