 <bold>Methods:</bold> The preop. plasma levels of cystatin C and creatinine were measured in 1638 patients undergoing CABG. eGFRcystatin-C and eGFRcreatinine were calculated using two pairs of estimating equations, CAPA-LMrev, and CKD-EPIcystatin C and CKD-EPIcreatinine, respectively. The patients were studied over a median follow-up time of 3.5Â years (2.0-5.0 y) and the mortality determined.
