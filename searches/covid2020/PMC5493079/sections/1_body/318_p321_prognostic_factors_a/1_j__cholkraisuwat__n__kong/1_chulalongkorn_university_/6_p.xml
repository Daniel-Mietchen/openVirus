<p id="Par2903">TH was applied in 51 comatose survivors, including 40 survivors (78.4 %) from out-of-hospital arrest. The primary cardiac rhythm for the majority (40/51, 78.4 %) was non-shockable rhythm. The median age of patients was 59 years. Overall, 52.9 %(27/51) of patients survived. The median hospital LOS was 13 days. Nine of 27 survivors at discharge had good recovery (CPC1 = 6 and CPC2 = 3) Eight patients had severe disability(CPC3) and 10 patients were in a vegetative state (CPC4). Free of vasopressor was the only prognostic factor for good neurological recovery (p = 0.012) and survival (p &lt; 0.001), while the shorter time from collapse to ROSC was associated with favorable outcome (p = 0.044). Additionally, duration of less than 6 hours from ROSC to achieved temperature and protocol completion were associated with survival (p = 0.038 and p = 0.027, respectively). Cardiac rhythm, location of arrest, target temperature attainment, rebound hyperthermia and age were not associated with any clinical outcome.</p>
