<p id="Par2901">We retrospectively reviewed baseline characteristics, cooling practice and clinical outcomes of post-arrest patients treated with TH in our institute from 2006 to 2014. Neurological status measured by the Cerebral Performance Categories Scale (CPC) and survival rate were evaluated. Prognostic factors for good neurological recovery and survival were analyzed. Continuous data were reported as medians and percentage. Chi-square and Mann- Whitney U test were used to compare data of patients with favorable outcomes and those with unfavorable outcomes.</p>
