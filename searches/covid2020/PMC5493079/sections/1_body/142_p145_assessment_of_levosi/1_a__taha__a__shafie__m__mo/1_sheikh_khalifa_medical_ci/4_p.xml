 <bold>Results:</bold> Completed data sets were obtained from 40 patients , CI, cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), serum lactate, mixed venous saturation, arterio venous oxygen content difference and dPCO2. Subsequently, Ca-CvO2, (Cv-aCO2/Da-vO2) and the CI was examined and both found to be statistically significant different after starting levosimendan in cardiogenic shock patients (p &lt; 0.001), comparing the serial measurements show statistical significant difference between initial samples and after 6 hrs. From starting levosimendan (P &lt; 0.05)
