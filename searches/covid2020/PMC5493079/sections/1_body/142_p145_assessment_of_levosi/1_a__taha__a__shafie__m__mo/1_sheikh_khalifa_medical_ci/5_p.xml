 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In our clinical series, dPCO2, Ca-CvO2 in patients with cardiogenic shock was significantly improved after starting levosimendan in cardiogenic shock patients, within 6Â hours of initial resuscitation; therefore, it might be reasonable to consider levosimendan as a potential therapeutic option for microcirculatory recruitment during cardiogenic shock state. Further studies needed to confirm these findings
