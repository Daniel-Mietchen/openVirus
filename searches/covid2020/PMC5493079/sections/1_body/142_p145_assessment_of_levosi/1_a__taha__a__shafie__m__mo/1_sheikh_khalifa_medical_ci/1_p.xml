 <bold>Introductions:</bold> The presences of microcirculatory inadequacy despite resuscitation of hemodynamics strongly correlate with microcirculatory failure and poor outcome. (1) We sought to evaluate the response of the levosimendan, as an inotrope and vasodilator, that can improve perfused capillary density in previous studies.(2) and whether these beneficial effect can be utilized during cardiogenic shock state. Recruitment of microcirculation can be detected by veno- arterial pCO2 difference (Î” pCO2) which increases earlier as the intracapillary blood velocity falls and could reflect the adequacy of microvascular blood flow.
