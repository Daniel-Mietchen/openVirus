 <bold>Results:</bold> 102 patients were enrolled(64 in group A and 38 in group B).Clinical variables are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig25" ref-type="fig">25</xref>. Cox-regression analysis shows that high RDW values were significantly associated with 28-day mortality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig26" ref-type="fig">26</xref>). Patients in Group B had higher level of RDW on admission (16.7 ± 2 % vs. 15.1 ± 2.2 %; p = 0.03). Nevertheless, the accuracy of RDW to predict mortality was similar in the two groups (ROC curve 0.697 for group A and 0.711 for group B). Patients with higher RDW had also a lower RI but similar levels of haptoglobin when compared to others.
