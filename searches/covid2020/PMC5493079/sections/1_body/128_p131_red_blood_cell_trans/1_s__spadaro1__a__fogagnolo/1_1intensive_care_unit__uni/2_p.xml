 <bold>Methods:</bold> All patients admitted to ICU over 8 months were enrolled in the study. Patients were analyzed in two groups (A if no RBCT was given and B receiving RBCT before ICU admission). We measured RDW, reticulocyte index (RI) and haptoglobin on admission and 48 h thereafter. RDW was categorized in tertiles: &lt;14 %; 14,1-15,8 %; &gt;15,8 %. We collected 28-day mortality, changes in SOFA score and length of stay in ICU
