 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Some studies have found a correlation between increased RDW and mortality in ICU patients. However, RDW values can be increased by transfusion (RBCT), erythropoiesis or hemolysis. In this study we investigated whether the prognostic value of RDW was influenced by RBCT in ICU patients.
