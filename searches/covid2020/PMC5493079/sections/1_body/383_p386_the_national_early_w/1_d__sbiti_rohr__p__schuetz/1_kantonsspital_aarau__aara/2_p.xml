 <bold>Methods:</bold> We prospectively followed 925 CAP patients from a previous Swiss multicentre trial. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 6 years of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were adverse clinical outcome defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, complications (empyema) and unplanned hospital readmission all within 30 days. We used logistic regression models and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) to compare NEWS with PSI and CURB-65.
