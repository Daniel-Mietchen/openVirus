 <bold>Results:</bold> Six-year overall mortality was 45.1 % (n = 417) with a step-wise increase with higher NEWS categories. For 30-days and 6-year mortality prediction, NEWS showed only moderate discrimination (AUC 0.65 and 0.60) inferior compared to PSI and CURB-65. For prediction of ICU admission, NEWS showed high discrimination (AUC 0.73) and improved the prognostic accuracy of PSI (AUC from 0.66 to 0.74, p = 0.001) and CURB-65 (AUC from 0.64 to 0.73, p = 0.015). NEWS was also superior to PSI and CURB-65 for prediction of complications, but did not well predict rehospitalisation.
