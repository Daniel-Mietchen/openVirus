 <bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively analysed the data of patients admitted to an ICU between 2007 – 2009 who had AKI stage I, as per AKI Network classification, and had undergone haemodynamic monitoring within 12 h of diagnosis. We collected baseline characteristics and differentiated between patients who progressed to AKI stage III and those who did not. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for progression.
