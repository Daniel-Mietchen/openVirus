 <bold>Results:</bold> 210 patients were included in the analysis. 85 patients (41 %) progressed to AKI III, 120 did not. Five patients with AKI I died before their renal function recovered or progressed. Patients with AKI I who progressed to AKI III were sicker on the day of AKI I with a higher SOFA score (9 vs 8; p &lt; 0.001), higher arterial lactate (2 vs 1.6 mmol/L; p &lt; 0.001), lower MAP (median 71 vs 74 mmHg; p = 0.01), lower cardiac index (median 2.6 vs 3.3 L/min/m
 <sup>2</sup>; p &lt; 0.001) and increased need for respiratory and cardiovascular support. There was no difference in Hb concentration (96 g/L). Risk factors for progression from AKI I to AKI III are shown in Table
