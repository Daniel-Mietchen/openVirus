Demographic, clinical, radiological and microbiological data were recorded. Infections were diagnosed according to current guidelines. Patients who died within 72 hours from admission were excluded from analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism. Significance was set at a p value &lt; = 0.05.</p>
