 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results from this study are consistent with previous findings. The risk of death prior to discharge from our intensive care unit is almost 30Â % higher for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. From the data presented above, it may be prudent to consider that patients with pulmonary fibrosis presenting with no reversible causes of acute respiratory failure may be less likely to benefit from admission to the ICU.
