<p id="Par2727">The vast majority of CAs (42.3 %) occurred in areas supervised by the cardiology department. Together with the “cardio surgical” CAs, cardiology related CAs percentage arises to 58.2 %. Number of CAs in the ED and in the RIU was also significant. Mean age of CAs patients was similar in all locations, whereas there were significant differences as far as primary causes and initial rhythm analysis are concerned. These interesting results merit further study, larger number of patients and detailed analysis of all related parameters in order to conduct safe conclusions and to be able to undertake preventive measures. </p>
