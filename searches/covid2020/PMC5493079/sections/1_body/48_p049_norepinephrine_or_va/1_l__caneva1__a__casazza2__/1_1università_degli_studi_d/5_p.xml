 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We didn’t find any statistically significant difference between NV and NE groups in ICU mortality, despite NV had a significantly higher predicted mortality according to the SOFA. Renal function impairment wasn’t significantly different in the two groups. The greater incidence of thrombocytopenia (p = 0.03) observed in NV group is in line with other studies.
