 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Low-dose vasopressin (VP) recently emerged as a promising therapy for septic shock[1]. The rationale for its use is the relative VP deficiency in patients with septic shock and VP ability to restore vascular tone and blood pressure, reducing the need for cathecolamines[2]; however VP outcome effects in septic patients remain unclear[3-4].
