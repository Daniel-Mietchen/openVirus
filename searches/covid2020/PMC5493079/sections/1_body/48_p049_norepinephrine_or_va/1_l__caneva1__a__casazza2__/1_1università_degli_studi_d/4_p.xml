 <bold>Results:</bold> 39 patients were enrolled, 15 patients received NE + VP (NV group), 24 received NE (NE group). Overall mortality rate was 46.1 %: 53.3 % in NV and 42 % in NE group respectively (p = 0,47). The need of RRT was greater in NV than in NE group (40vs20%, p = 0,19). Urinary output in the first 24 hours of vasopressor was lower in NV group (0,7vs1 ml/kg/h, p = 0,47). NV group patients had more severe haemodynamic impairment and also worse severity score (SOFA = 11,8vs9,9; p = 0,03), worse renal function (AKIN 3vs2) at ICU admission and higher plasma lactates levels (3,9vs3,6; p = 0,39) NV group had greater incidence of thrombocytopenia (105vs207, p = 0,03).
