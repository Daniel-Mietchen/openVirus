 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Endotracheal Tube (ETT) begins to be colonized with oral bacteria and respiratory pathogens that adhere to its inner surface. The use of Airway Medix Closed Suction System (AMCSS) could effectively reduce ETT resistance, bacterial burden, biofilm development and the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS). The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the AMCSS compared to a standard closed suction system.
