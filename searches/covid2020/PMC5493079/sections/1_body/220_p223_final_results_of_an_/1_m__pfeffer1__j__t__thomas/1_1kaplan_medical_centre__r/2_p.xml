 <bold>Methods:</bold> 80 critically ill patients were randomized into two groups. 40 patients (Control) were suctioned using KIMVENT* Closed Suction System (Kimberly Clark, USA) and 40 patients (Study) were suctioned using AMCSS (AMCSS, Biovo Technologies, Israel). 15 patients were withdrawn from the trial. CPIS calculations were performed daily. Post extubation, resistance through the ETT was measured using a Mass flow meter and pressure transducer. The ETTs were then cut open longitudinally. Two 1Â cm-long hemi-sections of the distal part of the ETT were dissected for qualitative and quantitative analysis of representative biofilm accumulations using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). During the analysis, investigators were blind to treatment allocation.
