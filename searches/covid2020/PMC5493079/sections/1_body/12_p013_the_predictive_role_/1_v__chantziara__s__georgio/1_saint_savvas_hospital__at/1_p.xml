 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Central Nervous System (CNS) infections after neurosurgical procedures with extensively drug resistant bacteria (XDR), in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, is a life threatening complication requiring early identification and immediate action. Increased number of white blood cells (WBC), high temperature and circulating acute phase proteins are common in those patients making timely diagnosis challenging. We sought to investigate the reliability of serum C-Reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) to early identify and monitor CNS infections.
