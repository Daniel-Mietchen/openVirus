 <bold>Methods:</bold> Infected (ICUi) and non-infected ICU patients (ICU Control-ICUc) and normal volunteers (C) had CD64 levels measured by the Accellix CD64 instrument. Measurements were calculated as ‘CD64 index’, i.e. the ratio between the median fluorescence of the PMN population and the median fluorescence of the control beads population. Infection assessment was categorized per the CDC and ISF criteria as having a DEFINITE, PROBABLE, POSSIBLE, or NO INFECTION.
