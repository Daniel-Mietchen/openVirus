 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Differentiating patients who are infected or not in the intensive care unit (ICU) can be very difficult. Present diagnostic tests remain inadequate. CD64 has been found to be a potentially useful marker to identify infected patients. Unfortunately, CD64 measured by standard flow cytometers in a laboratory takes hours to perform. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Accellix CD64 instrument which provides infection assessment in 30Â minutes in ICU patients.
