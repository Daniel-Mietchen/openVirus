 <bold>Methods:</bold> MPs were isolated by high speed centrifugation from RBC transfusion bags. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECS) were incubated for 6Â hours with supernatant from RBC bags either containing MPs or depleted from MPs, with or without addition of monocytes or granulocytes. Controls were incubated with PBS as a negative and TNF as a positive control. Expression of adhesion markers were measured on flow cytometry and markers of coagulation and inflammation were measured in the culture medium. Monocytes were cultured with stained MPs and adherence was studied using confocal microscopy.
