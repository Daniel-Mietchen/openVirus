 <bold>Results:</bold> Supernatant from RBCs containing MPs up-regulate endothelial expression of ICAM and E-selectin with 7.8 [2.8 – 22.9]% and 2.6 [-1 – 7.7]% resp. compared to baseline. Up-regulation was absent when stimulated with RBC supernatant depleted from MPs. Also, up-regulation depended on the presence of monocytes. MPs adhere to monocytes, which was partly abrogated after co-incubation with antiCD11b or anti-CD18 antibodies (from 100 to 67[57-72]% and to 56[47-67]% of positive cells resp.). RBC-derived EVs also strongly induce endothelial shedding of vWF.
