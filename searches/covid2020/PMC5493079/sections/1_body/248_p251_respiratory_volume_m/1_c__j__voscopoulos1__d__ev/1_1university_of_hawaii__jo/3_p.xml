 <bold>Results:</bold> Of 80 alarm conditions, 62 (78 %) were false alarms. The other 18 events (¡Ý 2 min) occurred in 15 patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig65" ref-type="fig">65a</xref>). The RVM showed that 11/18 desaturation events were from patient motion &amp; high MV &amp; only 7 events were ¡°true desaturation¡ ± events, (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig65" ref-type="fig">65b</xref>). Each true desaturation event was preceded by ¡°Un-Safe MV¡ ± by 16.7¡À4.6 min (mean¡ÀSEM) &amp; the severity of ¡°Un-Safe MV¡ ± was strongly correlated with the time delay (r = 0.77, p &lt; 0.05). While MFANOVA found no difference in the demographics of the populations with true desaturation events vs. false alarms (p &gt; 0.2 for ht, wt, age, BMI, sex), the length of stay in the PACU for true desaturations group was significantly longer (176¡À9min vs. 134¡À18min, p &lt; 0.05).
