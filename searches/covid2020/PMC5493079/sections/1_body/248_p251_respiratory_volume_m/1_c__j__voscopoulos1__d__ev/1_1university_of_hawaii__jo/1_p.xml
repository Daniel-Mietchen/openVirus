 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Pulse oximetry (SpO2) is associated with significant false alarms, &amp; gives late notice of respiratory depression. In this observational study, we assessed the ability of a respiratory volume monitor (RVM) that non-invasively measures minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume &amp; respiratory rate to capture respiratory depression in advance of low SpO2 &amp; with fewer false alarms.
