 <bold>Methods:</bold> The existing care bundle (head up positioning, daily sedation holds) was supplemented by a 3-step process of interventions between December 2008 and October 2015, each accompanied by a dedicated staff education initiative: 1) Guidance on stress ulcer prophylaxis, changing of respiratory circuitry and sedation holds; 2) Introduction of a new endotracheal tube with continuous subglottic suction and cuff pressure monitoring; 3) New oral hygiene guidance. Data was analysed using MS excel and a statistical process control chart designed for non-conformity attribute data with an unequal area of opportunity. Values are expressed as mean and upper control limits (UCLu).
