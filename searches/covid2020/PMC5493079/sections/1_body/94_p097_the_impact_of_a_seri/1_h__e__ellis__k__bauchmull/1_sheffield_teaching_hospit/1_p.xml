 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) has a reported incidence of between 9 – 27 % and a strong association with increased ICU length of stay and mortality[1]. Current evidence suggests that the application of a care ‘bundle’ may reduce the rate of VAP [2]. We aimed to assess the effects of a sequential multi-faceted care bundle and audit program on VAP rates in our institution.
