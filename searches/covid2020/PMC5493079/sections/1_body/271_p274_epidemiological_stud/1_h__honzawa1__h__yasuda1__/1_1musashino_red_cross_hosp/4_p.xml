<p id="Par2495">We performed a multivariate analysis for death at the time of discharge from hospital and development of infection. The odds ratio for death at the time of discharge from hospital for patients who received early enteral nutrition was 0.48 (95Â % CI 0.28 to 0.81). These results showed the different relationship among the groups. In the group of cause-specific cases, a similar trend was observed only in patients with gallstones.</p>
