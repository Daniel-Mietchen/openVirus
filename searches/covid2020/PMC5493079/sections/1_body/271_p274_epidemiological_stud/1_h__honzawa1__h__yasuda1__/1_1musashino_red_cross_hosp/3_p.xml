 <bold>Results:</bold> The total cases of severe acute pancreatitis (n = 1159) were divided into gallstone cases (n = 456), alcoholic cases (n = 456), idiopathic cases (n = 240), and other cases (n = 222). According to the comparison regarding the background of patients, young men were prone to be more in the alcoholic group. A comparison of patient outcomes revealed significant statistical differences for rates of administration of early enteral nutrition (gallstone 22.8 %, alcoholic 30.9 %, idiopathic 26.2 %, other 20.2 %, p = 0.014), mechanical ventilation management (31.5 %, 27.6 %, 37.9 %, 29.2 %, p = 0.043), and mortality (14.1 %, 8.1 %, 16.6 %, 17.5 %, p = 0.001) among the four groups.
