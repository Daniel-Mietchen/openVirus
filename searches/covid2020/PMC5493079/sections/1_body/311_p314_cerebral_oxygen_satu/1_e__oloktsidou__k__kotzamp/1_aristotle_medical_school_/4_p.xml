<p id="Par2824">24 pigs under general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation were included in this study. In all study animals ventricular fibrillation was induced with application of electrical current via a pacing wire. After 7 min of CA, CPR was initiated with the use of LUCAS mechanical device and after 5 more min, initial CA-rhythm was analyzed and advanced life support interventions were provided according to the 2015 ERC guidelines. Regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) was recorded before and after resuscitation in 1 min intervals by INVOS OXIMETER via a Somasensor electrode placed on pigs heads. Pigs were divided into two groups depending on return of spontaneous circulation or not, G-A: no ROSC (n = 15) &amp; G-B: ROSC (n = 9). G-A &amp; G-B were compared at 6 Phases: P0 (baseline), P1 (7 min after CA-no flow), P2 (5 min after CPR initiation) and thereafter every 5 min (P3-P5). For the statistical analysis repeated measures ANOVA was used (SPSS21).</p>
