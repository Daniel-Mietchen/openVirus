 <bold>Introduction:</bold> We aimed to improve the active mobilisation of Intensive Care (ICU) patients through a quality improvement (QI) project. Only 50% of ICU patients return to work within one year of discharge [1]: there are ongoing physical, psychological and cognitive problems after ICU discharge [1, 2]. Active mobilisation shortens hospital stay, increases return to independent function [3] and reduces delirium [3]. UK ICU standards, introduced in 2013, direct 45 minutes/day of active mobilisation in suitable patients.
