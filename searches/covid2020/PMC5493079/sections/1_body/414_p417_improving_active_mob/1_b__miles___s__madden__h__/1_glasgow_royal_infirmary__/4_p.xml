 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of this QI project show that a MD approach to mobilisation can achieve results. The weekly data collection and discussion proved essential in advancing success. We had no extra resources or new funding to help us increase mobilisation time and we used our data and successive PDSA cycles to achieve success.
