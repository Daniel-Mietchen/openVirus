 <bold>Methods:</bold> Our ICU selected a multidisciplinary (MD) team in January 2014 to lead the mobilisation QI project and a commitment was made to the weekly collection and presentation of data. We used the ADEPT (aim, data, evidence, process, team) format. Our initial aim was 20 minutes of active mobilisation daily in 95% of suitable ICU patients. Patients had to be able to obey commands, to have achieved a degree of cardiovascular stability and must have no musculoskeletal injuries precluding mobilisation. Vasopressor use and invasive ventilation per se were not barriers to active mobilisation. Agreed forms of active mobilisation were active limb exercises (a booklet of exercises was developed), bed edge sit (dangle), sitting out of bed in a chair, standing and walking. Baseline data was collected and serial Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycles were carried out.
