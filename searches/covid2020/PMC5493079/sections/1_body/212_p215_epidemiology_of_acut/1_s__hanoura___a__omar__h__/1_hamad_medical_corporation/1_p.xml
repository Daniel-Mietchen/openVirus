 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Despite of the advances in the critical care diagnosis and treatment, the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) remains high. In cardiac surgery AKI is reported to be around 30 % with need for renal replacement therapy up to 1 %. [1] We aim to characterize the differences in premorbid status, etiology, intraoperative and postoperative influencing factors for AKI development and the patients’ secondary outcomes.
