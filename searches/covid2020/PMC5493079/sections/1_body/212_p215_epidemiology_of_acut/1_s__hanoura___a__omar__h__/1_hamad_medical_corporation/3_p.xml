 <bold>Results:</bold> The mean age was 52.7 ± 11.6 years. We reported high AKI association in our settings (25 %). The AKI group match the other group with respect to age, gender, body mass index, the association of diabetes or hypertension. AKI group had significantly higher additive Euro Score 6 ± 4 vs 4 ± 2, lower ejection fraction 47 ± 11 vs 50 ± 9 ( P = 0.00 and 0.00 respectively. Lengths of ventilation, stays in ICU and in hospital were significantly higher in the AKI group. The AKI group with post-operative atrial fibrillation 29.8 % vs 10.5 % (p = 0.001). AKI group had significantly higher mortality 6 % vs group I 1.7 % (p = 0.026). Interestingly, AKI was more prominent in Asian group than Arab 92(50.8 %) vs 77(42.5 %) P = 0.04 The independent risk factors for AKI in our population were additive Euro Score, cardiopulmonary bypass time, post-operative low hemoglobin, post-operative white cell count and total blood loss.
