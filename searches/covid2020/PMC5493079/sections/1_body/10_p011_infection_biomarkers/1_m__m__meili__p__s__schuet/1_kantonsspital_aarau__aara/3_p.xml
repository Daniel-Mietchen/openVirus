 <bold>Results:</bold> At baseline, CRP and PCT did not correlate well in the overall population (r2 = 0.16 and r2 = 0.04) and particularly in the subgroup of patients with non-pneumonic ARI. Low correlations were also found comparing cut-off ranges, day seven levels and biomarker changes from baseline to day seven. High admission levels of CRP (&gt;100 mg/dL, regression coefficient 1.7, 95%CI 0.6 to 2.8) as well as PCT (&gt;0.5ug/L regression coefficient 2.3, 95%CI 0.3 to 4.3) were significantly associated with days with restricted activities. There were no associations of both markers regarding ongoing discomfort at day 14.
