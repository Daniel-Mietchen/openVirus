 <bold>Introduction:</bold> There is a lack of studies comparing the utility of C-reactive protein (CRP) with procalcitonin (PCT) for the management of patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in primary care. Our aim was to study first the correlation between these markers, and second to compare their predictive accuracy in regard to clinical outcome prediction.
