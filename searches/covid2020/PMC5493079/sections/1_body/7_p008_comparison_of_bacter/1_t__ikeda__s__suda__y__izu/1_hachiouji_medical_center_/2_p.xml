 <bold>Methods:</bold> We would like to clarify the difference of patient fs background and various biomarkers (Procalcitonin:, Presepsin., Interleukin-6, Endotoxin activity assay:EAA,Angiopoietin-2) and 28-days mortality rate in sepsis and bacteremia. Patients were classified as a group in which blood culture was positive (BC-positive group: N = 31) or a group in which blood culture was negative (BC-negative group: N = 31).Blood cultures (blood samples were drown from different two sites) were performed immediately after ICU admission due to sepsis or septic shock. Results were expressed as mean+/-SD (median). Statistical analysis was used with Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi square test or Fisher’s test.
