 <bold>Methods:</bold> We prospectively included 148 patients admitted to the ICU with the suspected diagnosis of sepsis. Of these, 28 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. sCD14, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) were recorded at admission ICU day 1 and ICU day 3. Organ dysfunction, sepsis severity scores (SOFA scores, Apache II score), vital parameters and management were recorded during ICU stay.
