 <bold>Results:</bold> sCD14 at admission was associated with cardiovascular dysfunction: decreased mean arterial pressure (correlation coefficient = -0.552, p = 0.048) and increased vasopressor support (correlation coefficient = 0.761, p = 0.035). Patients with increase sCD4 had a more severe hepatocytolysis as demonstrated by increased levels of ALT (p = 0.019) and AST levels (p = 0.040). ICU length of stay correlated with sCD14 levels at admission (p = 0.011) and ICU day 1 (p = 0.012). Patients with sCD14 levels &lt; 2000 at admission had the lowest mortality rates and patients with presepsin levels &gt; 6000 had the highest mortality. Statistically significant differences were observed between sCD14 between survival and non-survivals on admission (p = 0.042), ICU day 1 (p = 0.036) and ICU day 3 (p = 0.042).
