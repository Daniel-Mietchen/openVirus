<p id="Par2787">We reviewed database of post arrest patients undergoing TH who survived to discharge with consciousness (Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance: CPC 1-3) in our hospital from 2006 to 2014. All hospital survivors were evaluated life or death status and death date on January 31st , 2015 by checking death certificates from national registry system. We contacted the survivors or their relatives by phone or mail and scheduled a follow-up visit to evaluate their ability. The patients who were unable to visit were assessed the functional disability by phone interview or using recorded follow-up data. The functional neurological outcome was scored on a disability rating scale.[1] This scale consisted of 1) arousability awareness and responsivity, 2) cognitive ability for self-care activities, 3) dependence on others and 4) psychosocial adaptability. The level of disability was defined as the followings: 0 – none; 1 – mild; 2 to 3.5– partial; 4 to 6 – moderate; 7 to 11 – moderately severe; 12 to 16 – severe; 17 to 21 – extremely severe; 22 to 24 – vegetative state and 25 to 29 – extreme vegetative state. In addition, survival rates at 6 months, 1 and 2 years after discharge were analyzed.</p>
