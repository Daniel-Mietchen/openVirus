<p id="Par2789">Of 51 patients treated with TH, 27 patients survived to hospital discharge. Seventeen of the hospital survivors were conscious: 6, 3 and 8 patients with CPC at discharge 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Five of them passed away later. Approximately 78.6 %, 76.9 % and 75 % of awake patients survived at 6 months, 1 and 2 years after discharge, respectively. The majority (3/5) of dead cases died within 6 months with severe functional disability (score 24-26). The patients’ disability scores were shown in table. One-third of awake patients with CPC 2 and 3 who still survived at 6 months after discharge finally recovered to normal physical and cognitive function, while most of patients with CPC1 returned to normal function or minimal disability.</p>
