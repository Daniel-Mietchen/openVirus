<p id="Par3221">Examination time at emergency department (ED) could have influence for patient Ls prognosis. Door to balloon time is one of the most famous quality indicators related to patient Ls outcome. However, there have not been a lot of time quality indicators at ED except door to needle time and door to antibiotics time. Other door to examination or intervention time could be a quality indicator at ED. It will be used evaluation, improvement, and maintenance of ED. Our aim was to develop a real time monitor to register and manage patient Ls flow and time. We will make new time quality indicators at ED with this monitor.
