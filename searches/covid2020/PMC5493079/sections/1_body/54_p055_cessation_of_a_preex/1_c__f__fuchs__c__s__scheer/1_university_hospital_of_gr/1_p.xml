 <bold>Introduction:</bold> A prior use of antiplatelet agents was associated with a survival benefit in sepsis [1, 2]. But it remains unclear, if chronic antiplatelet therapy should be continued or not during severe sepsis and septic shock. In addition, the subsequent need of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in patients with continued chronic antiplatelet therapy remains to be determined.
