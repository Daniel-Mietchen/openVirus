 <bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective, single-center cohort study of intensive care (ICU) patients with severe sepsis or septic shock at the University Hospital of Greifswald, Germany, from January 2010 to December 2013. The local ethics committee approved the study (Identifier: BB 133/10) and waived a written informed consent because of the anonymous data collection and the quality saving and observing character of the study. The administration of antiplatelet agents before and during ICU stay, the number of transfused RBC concentrates and mortality rates up to 90Â days were registered. Categorical data are represented as percentages and counts.
