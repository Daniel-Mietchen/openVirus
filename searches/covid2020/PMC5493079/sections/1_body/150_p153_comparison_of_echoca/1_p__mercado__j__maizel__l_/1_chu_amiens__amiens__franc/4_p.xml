 <bold>Results:</bold> 22 patients (36 measurements) were monitored with PAC, age 64y/o(60-70), SAPS 61(60-79), ejection fraction (EF) 58 %(46-61). The linear regression between COTTE and COPAC was R2 = 0.78 (P &lt; 0.001). The Bland and Altman analysis showed a bias of -0.4 l/min and limits of agreement from -2.8 to 1.9 l/min. The linear regression between SPAPecho and SPAP-PAC was R2 = 0.52 (P &lt; 0.001), the linear regression improves when SPAPecho was calculated from tricuspid gradient plus RAP measured by PAC R2 = 0.62 (P &lt; 0.001). The Bland and Altman analysis showed a bias of -3.7 mmHg and limits of agreement from -18.1 to 10.7 mmHg. Linear regression between E/A and PAOP, E/Ea and PAOP were weak, R2 = 0.33 (P &lt; 0.001) and R2 = 0.42 (P &lt; 0.001) respectively.
