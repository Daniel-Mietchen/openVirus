 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study confirms that COTTE correlates well with the measurement of COPAC in critical care patients sedated under mechanical ventilation. The TTE estimation of SPAP appears also reliable. But the TTE estimation of PAOP (E/Ea and E/A) in this population of patient with unselected EF is not consistent.
