 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Measurements of cardiac output (CO), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) remain important parameters for the management of critically ill patients. Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) with thermodilution technique has been considered the clinical standard in measurements of CO. However, it is an invasive technique that can be associated with complications. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a non-invasive technique allowing to calculate the CO and the PAPS. We decided to compare the CO and SPAP measured by TTE and by PAC.
