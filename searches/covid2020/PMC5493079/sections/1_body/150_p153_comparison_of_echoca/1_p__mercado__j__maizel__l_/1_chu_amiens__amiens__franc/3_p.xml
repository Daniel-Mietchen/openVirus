<p id="Par1804">The CO, PAOP, right auricular pressure (RAP) and SPAP were measured using the PAC (-PAC). CO-PAC was an average of three thermodilutions. The TTE CO (COTTE) was derived from the Doppler stroke volume, the E/A ratio from the transvalvular mitral flow and the Ea from the mitral annular TDI. SPAP was estimated from tricuspid gradient (SPAPecho) plus RAP (estimated by inferior vena cava diameter). Measurements made with TTE and PAC were performed simultaneously by two experienced operators. A linear regression and a Bland-Altman analysis were performed.</p>
