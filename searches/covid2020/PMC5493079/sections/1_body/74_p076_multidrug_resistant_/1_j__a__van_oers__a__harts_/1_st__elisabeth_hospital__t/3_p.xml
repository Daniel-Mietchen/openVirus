 <bold>Results:</bold> 311 patients were included, 173 men, median age 64 years [18-90], median APACHE II 18 [3-73]. A total of 27 MDROs were found in 23 patients. Rectal cultures on admission revealed 17 MDROs in 14 patients, 10 MDROs were cultured in predominately sputum cultures in 9 patients during ICU stay. MDROs included 15 E. coli, 4 Klebsiella spp., E. cloacae, M. morganii, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp. all 1, 2 S. Pneumoniae, 1 MRSA and 1 VRE. As only 1 patient had a MDRO positive blood culture colonisation appears more frequent than infection. MDRO+ patients were placed in full contact isolation. Ventilator time, VAP, sepsis and LOS ICU were significant higher in MDRO+ patients (Table
