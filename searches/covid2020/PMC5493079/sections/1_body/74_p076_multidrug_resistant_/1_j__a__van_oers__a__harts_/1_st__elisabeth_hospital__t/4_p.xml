 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> MDROs were found in a small percentage of the patients. As MDRO+ patients had a longer ventilator time and LOS ICU they may be more sensitive to VAP and sepsis. A large part of MDROs was imported into the ICU. This underscores the importance of our MDRO Prevention program: surveillance cultures, special attention to hand hygiene and washing with 2Â % chlorhexidine cloths.
