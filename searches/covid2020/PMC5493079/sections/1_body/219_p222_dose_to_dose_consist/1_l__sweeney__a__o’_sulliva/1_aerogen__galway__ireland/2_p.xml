 <bold>Methods:</bold> Two adult breathing patterns were evaluated using a breathing apparatus to simulate both a normal adult (15 BPM, Vt 500ML, I/E 1:1) [1] and a Cystic Fibrosis adult (22 BPM, Vt 525ML, I/E 1:4) [2] Adult high flow nasal cannula (Optiflow
 <sup>TM</sup> Fisher and Paykel) were attached to a humidifier (MR850
 <sup>TM</sup>, Fisher and Paykel) set at 37 °C. 2.0 ml of Salbutamol (2 mg/ml) was nebulized using a vibrating mesh nebuliser (VMN) (Aerogen Solo, Aerogen, Ireland) with an average mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 4.8 μm (measured using the Apparatus E/5 impactor). Tracheal Dose (dose delivered beyond the trachea) at each gas flow rate under test (10 and 30 LPM) was captured using an absolute filter (Respirgard 303, Baxter) distal to the airway model (n = 10), see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig49" ref-type="fig">49</xref>. The mass of drug eluted from the filters was determined using UV spectroscopy (at 276 nm) and interpolation on a standard curve of Salbutamol concentrations (200 μg/mL to 3.125 μg/mL).
