 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> From the results of testing performed for both normal and CF simulated adults at gas flow rates of 10 and 30 LPM, the p-values for each respectively are &gt;0.05 (0.891, 0.744, 0.188 and 0.589). This indicates that each set of data (n = 10) are normally distributed and therefore dosing is consistent. It may be concluded from this study that delivery of aerosol to adults at both high and low gas flow rates via NHF therapy is an efficient and highly reproducible means of administration.
