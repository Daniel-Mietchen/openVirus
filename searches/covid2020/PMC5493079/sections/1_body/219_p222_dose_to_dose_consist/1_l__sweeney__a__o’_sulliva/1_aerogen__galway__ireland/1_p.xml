 <bold>Introduction:</bold> This study investigated the dose to dose consistency by aerosol delivery during nasal high flow therapy (NHF). We sought to investigate the efficiency of dosing across two different gas flow rates during simulated normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) breathing. Salbutamol was used as a tracer aerosol. The efficient and reliable delivery of aerosol to CF sufferers by a non-invasive, comfortable means of delivery could have considerable effects on patient care.
