 <bold>Results:</bold> The cohort included 464 patients with the following characteristics: age = 51.7 ± 21.9 years, APACHE II score = 23.3 ± 8.7, 65.9 % males and mostly admitted from the emergency department (40.7 %) and wards (30.2 %). Thirty-one (6.7 %) patients were MRSA colonized and had similar age, gender distribution, chronic comorbidities and admission APACHE II score compared with the other patients. Patients referred from other hospitals had the highest prevalence (19.4 % versus 6.2 % for the other patients, p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis with age, gender, APACHE II score and source of admission (other hospitals versus other source) being the independent variables, only admission to the ICU from another hospital was associated with MRSA colonization (odds ratio, 4.01; 95 % confidence interval, 1.48-10.90; p = 0.006). Only 3 (0.6 %) patients in the cohort had MRSA bacteremia during ICU stay and all were MRSA colonized (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, 14 patients had respiratory tract infection due to MRSA, 9 (64.3 %) of whom were MRSA colonized (p &lt; 0.001). MRSA colonized patients had similar hospital mortality (38.7 % versus 41.8 %, p = 0.74) and length of stay (42 ± 43 versus 55 ± 97 days, p = 0.48) compared with the other patients.
