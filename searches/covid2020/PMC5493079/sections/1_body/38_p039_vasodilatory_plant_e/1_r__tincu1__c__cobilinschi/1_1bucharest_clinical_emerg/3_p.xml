 <bold>Results:</bold> Initially, the average temperature for the Ortogel group was 39.5 ± 0.11 degrees Celsius, with similar values in the control group (39.0 ± 0.14). Ortogel was able to significantly decrease hyperthermia at Δ T-max by 2.7 °C (p &lt; 0.001), similar with paracetamol effects at Δ T-max of 3.2 °C (p &lt; 0.001). The gel showed significant suppression in cutaneous temperature by 2.6 °C, from 39.5 ± 0.11 °C to 36.2 ± 0.32 °C (p &lt; 0.001), and the percentage inhibition of fever was 6.8 %. The antipyretic effect started 45 min after administration (p &lt; 0.01) and the reduction in rectal temperature was maintained for 3 h (p &lt; 0.001).
