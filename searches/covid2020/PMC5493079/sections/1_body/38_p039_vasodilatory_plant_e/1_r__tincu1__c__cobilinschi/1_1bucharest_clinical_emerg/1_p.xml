 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Fever is a sign that is commonly associated with syndromes in intensive care. Hyperthermia is initiated by the action of IL-1Î² at organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, where prostaglandin E2 is released. Ortogel is a gel which contains plant extracts (Capsicum, Arnica Montana, Symphytum Officinale, Juglans Regia, Tannus Communis, Sambucus, Armoracia Rusticana, Lavandula Angustifolia) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic effects, producing cutaneous vasodilation. The purpose of this study was to assess the anti-pyretic effects of Ortogel when compared to Acetaminophen administration in Intensive Care patients.
