 <bold>Methods:</bold> Prospective observational study carried out in a 500-bed general hospital with a 14-bed ICU, in which a specialized unit for catheter insertion is available. PICCs were implanted always in the middle third of the arm, following a protocol that includes strict sterile insertion procedure and echo-radiological control. Data of patients with PICCs inserted from January 2013 to April 2015 were collected, including demographics, characteristics of insertion, complications and outcomes. Descriptive data included frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR) (25th-75th percentile) for quantitative variables.
