 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Many patients in non-intensive care unit settings receive PICCs; most of them were haemato-oncological patients, mainly for the administration of chemotherapy. There were no relevant complications related to catheter insertion. The mean time of use was 70 days, and the reason for withdrawal was the end of treatment or death. An incidence density of CRBSI of 0.7‰ catheter-days was recorded with few symptomatic DVT.
