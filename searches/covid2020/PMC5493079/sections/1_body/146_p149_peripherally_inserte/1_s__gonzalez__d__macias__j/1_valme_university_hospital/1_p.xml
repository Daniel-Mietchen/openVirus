 <bold>Introductions:</bold> The use of peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs) has notably increased in hospitalized, critically ill and ambulatory patients. However, it is important to understand the rationale and risks associated with this new technology. The aim of this study was to describe patterns of use and complications of PICCs, which were placed in the ICU setting.
