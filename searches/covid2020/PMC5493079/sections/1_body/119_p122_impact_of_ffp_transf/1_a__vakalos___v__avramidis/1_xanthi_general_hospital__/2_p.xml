Total, per patient, per hospitalization days (HD), per patient under mechanical ventilation (pts V) and per ventilation days (VD) Using linear correlation method, we looked for linear slope, correlation coefficient (r), and coefficient of determination (r2), and by linear regression method using ANOVA test we looked for p value, according VAP and FFP transfusion.
