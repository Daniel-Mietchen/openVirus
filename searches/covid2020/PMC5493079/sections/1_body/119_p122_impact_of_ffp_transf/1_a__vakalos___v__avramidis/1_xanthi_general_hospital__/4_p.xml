 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> According to our data, there was no statistically significant correlation detected between VAP and FFP transfusion indexes. Our data suggest that even though FFP transfusion may have an impact on immunosuppression and infection disease developing, the impact on VAP is not statistically significant.
