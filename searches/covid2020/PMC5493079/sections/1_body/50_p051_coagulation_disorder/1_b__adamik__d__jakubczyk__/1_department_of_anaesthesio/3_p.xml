 <bold>Results:</bold> Among 51 patients admitted with severe sepsis, 16 (31 %) had a diagnosis of overt DIC. Out of 16 DIC patients, 5 patients died (NS; DIC score 5 ± 0.4, 6 ± 1.0, 5 ± 0.0, and 6 ± 0.0 points on day 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 11 survived (S; DIC score 5 ± 0.4, 4 ± 1.2, 4 ± 2.1, and 3 ± 1.8 points). On admission, major coagulation abnormalities identified by thromboelastometry, indicating a hypocoagulable pattern of abnormalities, were recorded for patients who did not survive: increased CT (p = 0.005 in EXTEM; p = 0.51 in INTEM) and CFT (p = 0.02 in EXTEM; 0.05 in INTEM), a lower alpha angle (p = 0.008 in EXTEM; p = 0.02 in INTEM), and decreased MCF (p = 0.03 in EXTEM; p = 0.31 in INTEM), in comparison to the results recorded for survivors. Differences in thromboelastometry parameters for groups of NS and S were also observed on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th days. Fibrinolysis was inhibited in nonsurvivors (LI 60 = 100 % and ML = 0 % in both EXTEM and INTEM) during the entire time of observation.
