 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Coagulation disorders are common in septic patients and constitute a considerable diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the ICU. The excessive activation of coagulation involves consumption of coagulation factors and platelets which may even lead to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In the present study we investigated the usefulness of the thromboelastometry method for bedside monitoring of coagulation abnormalities in patients with DIC treated at the ICU.
