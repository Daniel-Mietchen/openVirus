 <bold>Methods:</bold> In the observational study, patients with a diagnosis of severe sepsis and overt DIC on admission to the ICU were included. DIC was recognized using a scoring system based on the criteria proposed by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis [1]. The results of thromboelastometry tests (ROTEM) performed on the day of admission (day 1) and then daily for the next 3Â days were recorded. Clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), maximum clot firmness MCF), alpha angle, lysis index at 60 mi, and maximum lysis index (ML) were measured in EXTEM and INTEM tests.
