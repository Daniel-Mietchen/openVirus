 <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 116 patients were enrolled from April 2014 to September 2015. Fifty-two patients were assigned to IABP group and 64 patients to control group. The mean age was 64 ± 8 years in the IABP group and 67 ± 9 years in the control group (P = 0.06). The median LVEF was 40 % (31-45) in the IABP group and 40 % (35-55) in the control group (P = 0.873) and the median EuroSCORE was 6 (4-7) vs. 6 (4-7), P = 0.873, respectively. The primary outcome was observed in 40.4 % in the IABP group and 37.5 % in the control group (P = 0.751). Mortality rate was similar in both groups (15.4 % in the IABP group vs. 10.9 % in the control group, P = 0.478). Patients from the IABP group had a greater duration of inotrope use (3215 minutes [2003-5670] vs. 2110 minutes [1521-3355], P = 0.006) and longer ICU length of stay (5 [4-9] vs. 4 [3-6], P = 0.008).
