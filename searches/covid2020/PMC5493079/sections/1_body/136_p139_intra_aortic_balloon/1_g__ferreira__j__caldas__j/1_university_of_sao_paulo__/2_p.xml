 <bold>Methods:</bold> The IABCS study is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial in high-risk patients scheduled to elective cardiac surgery at the Heart Institute/University of São Paulo. Inclusion criteria were additive EuroSCORE &gt; = 6 or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; = 40 %. Eligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to IABP group or control group. Removal of IABP catheter was accomplished after 24 hours of the procedure under the following circumstances: cardiac index &gt; = 2.2 L/min/m2 and dobutamine infusion dose &lt; = 5 μg/kg/min. The catheter was immediately removed if a severe adverse event related to the procedure was detected. The primary outcome was the composite endpoint of mortality and major morbidity in 30 days after cardiac surgery, according to the modified Society of Thoracic Surgeons definition, which included: prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;24 hours), stroke, mediastinitis, need for reoperation, cardiogenic shock, and acute renal failure.
