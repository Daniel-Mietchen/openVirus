 <bold>Methods:</bold> This review was based on the PRISMA guideline. The systematic search of the literature published from 1941 through 30 June 2015 explored the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria were studies who investigated the reliability, the accuracy in predicting low CVP and the correlation with CVP of the IJV ultrasound measures in adult (&gt;18Â yrs) spontaneously breathing patients in shock. Three researchers selected studies using inclusion criteria and then assessed their quality using the STARD and QUADAS guidelines. The key words for literature search were: internal jugular veins, ultrasonography, volume status, central venous pressure, shock.
