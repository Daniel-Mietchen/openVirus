 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Previous studies tested the role of the internal jugular vein ultrasound exam (IJVUE) in the prediction of volume status but there are divergent conclusions on the its effectiveness in shock patients. For this reason we conducted a systematic review to check the level of reliability, validity and correlation with Central Venous Pressure (CVP) of the IJV ultrasound measures and the quality of reporting of literature on this topic.
