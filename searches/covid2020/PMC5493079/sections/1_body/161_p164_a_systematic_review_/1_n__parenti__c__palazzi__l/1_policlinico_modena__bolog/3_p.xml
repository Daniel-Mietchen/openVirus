 <bold>Results:</bold> We collected 219 studies: 20 excluded with reasons, 194 because duplicates. Five studies were included for the final analysis: 3 on reliability , 4 on correlation with CVP , 5 on validity. The IJV ultrasound measures (IJV ratio, anterior-posterior IJV diameter [AP-IJVD], IJV area) showed an inter-rater agreement range from moderate to excellent . The AP-IJVD had a significant high correlation with CVP; there were divergent conclusions on IJV area and poorly correlation for IJV ratio. The IJV ratio showed a moderate-good validity in predicting low CVP; the AP-IJV showed an high sensitivity and specificity for hyper and hypovolemia; an increase of IJV area effectively ruled out elevated CVP. Two studies respected more than 80 % of the STARD items and four more than 80 % of QUADAS items.
