 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Because few reports have been published on this topic the conclusions of this review should be confirmed. Anyway the quality of reporting and methodology of the studies collected were good. The IJVUE seems to have a good reliability and accuracy in predicting low or high CVP . The AP-IJVD shows the best correlation with CVP.
