<p id="Par3089">Admission to intensive care unit (ICU) is a routine practice following elective craniotomy for brain surgery. The rationale for this practice is the high risk of surgery on this vital organ and that ICU allows the early detection of serious complications. However, several studies have shown that many of these patients require minimal ICU interventions [1]. In addition, ICU resources are scarce and costly. Intermediate care units provide more monitoring than general wards and less than ICU with evidence to support the benefits on cost and patient outcomes [2]. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of patients underwent elective craniotomy who were admitted to the intensive or intermediate post-operative care unit (IMCU) settings postoperatively.</p>
