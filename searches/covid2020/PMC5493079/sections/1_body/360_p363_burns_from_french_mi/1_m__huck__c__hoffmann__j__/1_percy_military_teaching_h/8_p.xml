<p id="Par3315">Majority of burns are non-battle injuries, small in size and accessible to prevention [2]. For battle-related burn injuries, the anatomical topography can be explained by the personal protective equipment and the higher severity score due to the associated trauma and mechanism. The initial management of burns with multiple trauma remains attention to the priorities of circulation, airway and breathing. The treatment of either the burn or the associated injuries may be compromised by their combined presence, and a team approach is essential to their optimal management [3]. Only patients with major burns that required hospitalizations have been included. So, this study is the visible tip of the iceberg. All military care providers should be familiar with the assessment and treatment of burns in military settings.</p>
