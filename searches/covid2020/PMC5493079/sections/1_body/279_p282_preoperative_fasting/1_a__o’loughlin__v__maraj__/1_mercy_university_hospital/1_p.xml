 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Perioperative fasting reduces the risk of aspiration of gastric contents. This risk is weighed against the risk of intraoperative hypotension and insulin resistance postoperatively. Guidelines have varied from the “nil-by-mouth-from-midnight” regime to the more liberal “2-4-6” regime, as per the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) and ESA guidelines, whereby unlimited clear fluids are allowed up to 2 hours preoperatively.
