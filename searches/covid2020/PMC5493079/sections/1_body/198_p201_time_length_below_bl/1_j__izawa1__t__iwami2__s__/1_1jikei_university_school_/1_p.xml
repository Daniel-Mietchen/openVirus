 <bold>Introduction:</bold> There is still uncertainty about whether interventions for blood pressure is effective to treat new-onset acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. Moreover, little things are known about the significance of blood pressure in AKI without sepsis. The purposes of this study are to explore which parameter of blood pressure after the onset of AKI is associated with AKI stage progression, and to investigate whether the meaning of blood pressure in new-onset oliguric AKI is different between patients with or without sepsis.
