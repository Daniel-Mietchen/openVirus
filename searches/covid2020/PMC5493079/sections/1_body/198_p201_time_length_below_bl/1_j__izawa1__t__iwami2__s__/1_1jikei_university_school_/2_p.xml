 <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective cohort study including adult patients whose stay in the ICU (Jikei University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan) for 24 hours or more after the new onset of oliguric AKI. Oliguric AKI was defined as urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition. The primary outcome was AKI Stage 3 progression in the KDIGO criteria. In a 24-hour time frame, we analyzed mean arterial pressure (MAP) parameters (time-averaged MAP; lowest MAP; and time length below MAP 70 mmHg), considering stratification by sepsis.
