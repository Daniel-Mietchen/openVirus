 <bold>Results:</bold> We analyzed 576 patients with oliguric AKI. Stage 3 progression occurred in 16.0 % of them. In 158 patients with sepsis on ICU admission, Stage 3 progression occurred in 29.6 % of them. When the patients were stratified by sepsis, time length below MAP 70 mmHg was significantly associated with Stage 3 progression in multivariable analyses: OR 1.09 (95 % CI: 1.02-1.16) each hour with sepsis, OR 1.07 (1.03-1.12) each hour without sepsis. In the multivariable analysis of all patients, categorized time length below MAP 70 mmHg showed increasing trends of ORs: 1.58 (0.73-3.41) for 0-6 hours, 1.71 (0.74-3.98) for 6-12 hours, 3.19 (1.24-8.24) for 12-18 hours, 6.42 (2.41-17.10) for 18-24 hours.
