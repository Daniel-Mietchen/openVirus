 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In a 24-hour time frame after the new-onset of oliguric AKI, time length below MAP 70Â mmHg was associated with Stage 3 progression in oliguric AKI with or without sepsis. The results suggest that the recognition and treatment of AKI should be early regardless of sepsis. Urine output as a continuous monitor might be more useful for this purpose than serum creatinine. Further studies should be needed to investigate the meaning of interventions for blood pressure as treatment of AKI.
