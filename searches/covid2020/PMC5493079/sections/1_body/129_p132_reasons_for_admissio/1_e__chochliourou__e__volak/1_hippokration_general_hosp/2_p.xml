 <bold>Methods:</bold> We studied retrospectively all consecutive admissions in the PICU during a two years period (from 01.01.2012 to 31.12.2013). Data were collected through chart reviews for the following parameters: Demographics, reason for admission, underlying diseases, treatment characteristics, blood and blood products transfusions, and outcome of the patients. The criterion for transfusions followed the Sepsis Surviving Campaign 2012 guidelines for the pediatric population and the 2013 European guidelines for the Management of Bleeding and Coagulopathy following major trauma. In special cases the criterion for transfusion was clinically significant hemorrhage. The definitions of transfusion units were equivalent to 10Â ml/kg for Red Packed Cells (RPC) and Fresh Frosen Plasma (FFP), and 0.1 unit/kg for Platelets (PLT) and Cryoprecipitate (CP).
