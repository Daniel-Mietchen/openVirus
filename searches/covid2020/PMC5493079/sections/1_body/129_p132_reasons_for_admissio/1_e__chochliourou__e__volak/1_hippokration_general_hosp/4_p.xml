 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The most common reasons for admission in the pediatric intensive care unit were respiratory failure and pathology of the nervous system. These critically ill children presented in many occasions with anemia and thrombocytopenia, hemodynamic instability, clotting and bleeding disorders (while they were in infection) and the administration of blood and blood product derivatives were paramount to them. The immediate recognition of transfusion indications, and the early prompt interventions lead to better and faster recovery of small patients.
