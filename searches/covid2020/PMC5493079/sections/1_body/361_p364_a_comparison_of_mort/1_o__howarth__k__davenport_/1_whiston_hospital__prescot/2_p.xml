<p id="Par3321">Burn injuries are amongst the most severe physical and psychological insults a patient can experience and morbidity is extensive with variable mortality [1]. Studies have repeatedly confirmed factors associated with high mortality, which include increasing age, extent of burn and presence or absence of inhalational injury [2]. Predicting mortality from burns is useful in identifying those that may benefit from treatment or those in whom initiation of treatment is futile and not in the best interests of the patient. The objective of this surveillance study was to evaluate and compare the predictive value of Baux [3], Modified Baux (m-Baux) [4], and the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) scores for overall outcome in our cohort of burns patients admitted to the ICU over the last 5Â years.</p>
