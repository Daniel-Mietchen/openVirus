<p id="Par3241">This real-time ultrasound (US) guided study aimed to determine the rate of pneumothorax progression after 14-gauge (G) cannula insertion in a self-ventilating swine model. Standard treatment of suspected tension pneumothorax includes emergent insertion of a large bore catheter into the pleural cavity [1]. Widely accepted practice includes a catheter is left in-situ, open-ended and not capped based on a quoted dictum that air will only significantly be entrained into the pleural space via a wound &gt; ¨ø the diameter of the trachea [2].</p>
