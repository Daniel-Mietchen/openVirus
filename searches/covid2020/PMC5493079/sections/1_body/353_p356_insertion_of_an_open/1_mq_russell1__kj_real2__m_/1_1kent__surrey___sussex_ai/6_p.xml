<p id="Par3245">Insertion of an uncapped 14G cannula resulted in a significant pneumothorax developing in &lt;2 minutes. Each insertion (n = 3) resulted in the lung-point moving laterally by &gt;10 cm in &lt;2 minutes in all cases. At 2 minutes, swine were observed to develop a significant tachypnoea (respiratory rate &gt;50/min) and showed signs of respiratory distress. Upon aspiration of 800 ml-1200ml of air, normal physiology was restored. During aspiration, the lung-point was observed to shift medially and apically over time, confirming lung re-inflation. Upon replacement of caps and monitoring over 5 mins, no subsequent pneumothorax or physiological distress were observed, suggesting that the expanding pneumothorax resulted from air entrained via the open ended catheter.</p>
