<p id="Par3243">Three swine were consecutively anaesthetised using total intravenous anaesthesia and remained self-ventilating without endotracheal intubation at all times. A single 14G cannula (BD Venflon) was inserted sequentially into the second intercostal space of each hemithorax under US guidance. Real-time US was used to identify the development of pneumothorax. Lung-point shift was used to track pneumothorax expansion within pre-mapped numeric chest wall segments. In the event of respiratory distress, air was aspirated through the cannula.</p>
