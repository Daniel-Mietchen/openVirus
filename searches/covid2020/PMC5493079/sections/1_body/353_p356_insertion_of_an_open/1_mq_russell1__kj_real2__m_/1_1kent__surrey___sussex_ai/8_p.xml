<p id="Par3247">In this self-ventilating swine model, insertion of an uncapped, open-ended 14G catheter into the pleural space resulted in the rapid development of a large pneumothorax. If these data are transferable to humans, questions must be raised about leaving an open-ended catheter in the pleural space of a spontaneously breathing patient and this warrants further study.</p>
