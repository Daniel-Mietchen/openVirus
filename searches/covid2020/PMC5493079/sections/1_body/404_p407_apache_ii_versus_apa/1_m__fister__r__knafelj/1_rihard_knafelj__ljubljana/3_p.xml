 <bold>Results:</bold> Out of 1075 admitted patients, there were 244 octagenerians (23 %) with 28 % ICU mortality. ICU mortality in younger patients was 19 % (p &lt; .005). Both APACHE II and IV predicted 50 % mortality thus overestimating it by nearly 45 %. Actual LOS (3 days) was statistically shorter then predicted (6 days), p &lt; 0.005.
