<p id="Par3269">A total of 8 subjects participated in the study. All of the patients were males with an age range of 25–58 years (median: 47 years). In all eight cases the black widow spider identification was made via a description of the spider. The time of onset of pain ranged from 30 minutes after the sting to 4 hours (median: 1 hour).Of the eight patients, three were asymptomatic , three had leg pain and two patients had abdominal pain. One patient had nausea and vomiting (12 %); the same patient had ptosis and sweating with neck rigidity and back pain (12 %).Upon examination, most of the symptomatic patients had redness over the sting location with no signs of compartment or swelling. Patients with abdominal pain had a rigid abdomen and guarding that mimicked an acute abdomen. blood test includes white blood count, kidney function test, coagulation profile, and creatine kinase. The results were normal in seven patients; only one patient developed acute kidney injury although his kidney function returned to normal upon discharge. In the treatment, all symptomatic patients received analgesia depending on the physician’s discretion. Three patients received calcium gluconate intravenously and reported no improvement in their symptoms. In addition, all patients received tetanus toxoid vaccine. Four of the patients required admission (50 %), but they were all discharged with a mean hospital of stay of 3.75 days.</p>
