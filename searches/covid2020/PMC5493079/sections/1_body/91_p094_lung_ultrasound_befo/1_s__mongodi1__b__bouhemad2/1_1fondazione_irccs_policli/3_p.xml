 <bold>Results:</bold> Before FBS, LUS pattern wasn’t specific for VAP: both patients had only bilateral consolidations with no air-bronchogram (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16a,c</xref>). After FBS, LUS pattern changed. In patient 1, the tissue-like pattern turned into B-lines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16b</xref>). BAL was negative. In patient 2, the same tissue-like pattern was visualized after FBS; a dynamic arborescent air-bronchogram appeared (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16d</xref>). BAL had P.Aeruginosa 10(6) CFU/ml.
