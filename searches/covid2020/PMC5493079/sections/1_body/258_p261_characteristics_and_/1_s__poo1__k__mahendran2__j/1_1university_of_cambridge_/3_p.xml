 <bold>Results:</bold> Of 451 referrals, 276 (61 %) were refused whilst 125 (28 %) were accepted into the service. The remaining 50 (11 %) were transferred to another national centre due to the lack of ECMO beds at the studied centre. The mean age and duration of mechanical ventilation before referral were significantly higher in the futile group (56.1 years, 5.1 days) compared to those who were accepted (42.9 years, 3.1 days) or ¡®too well¡¯ (46.5 years, 3.3 days) (p &lt;0.05). The futile group had higher rates of multi-organ failure and severe immunosuppression. Gender, body mass index, lung injury scores and degree of hypoxaemia were similar in all 3 groups. Interestingly, 60 % of patients who were too well had higher lung injury scores (Murray score ¡Ý3) compared to 45 % and 41 % in those who were futile and accepted respectively. The survival of the ¡®futile¡¯ group was poor; whilst those who were too well and accepted had similar outcomes. At 180 days, 44 % of those who were too well had died, whilst 15 % of those who were futile survived.
