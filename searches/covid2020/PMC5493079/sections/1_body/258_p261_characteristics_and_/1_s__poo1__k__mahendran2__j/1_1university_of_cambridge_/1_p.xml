 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Veno-venous ECMO is a well-established life-saving measure in patients with severe acute respiratory failure refractory to conventional therapies. There are currently no accepted definite guidelines defining the suitability of patients nor studies outlining the outcomes of all patients referred. Criteria for acceptance and refusal are defined according to international standards and clinical judgement. We aimed to characterise the patient population based on whether they were refused or accepted into the ECMO service, and compare the outcomes in each category.
