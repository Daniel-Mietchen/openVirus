 <bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed all patients referred for veno-venous ECMO to one national centre over 44 months. Clinical parameters include gender, age, working diagnoses; referral centres, ventilator requirements, respiratory investigations and survival information. All referrals were categorized according to whether they were accepted or refused. The refused cohort was substratified based on whether they were ¡®too well¡¯ or ¡®futile¡¯. Patients were followed up to 180 days after referral.
