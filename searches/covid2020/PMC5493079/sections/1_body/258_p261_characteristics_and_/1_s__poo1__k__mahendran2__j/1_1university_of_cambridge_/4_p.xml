 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We present the first report on the outcomes of patients who referred but not accepted for vv-ECMO in the context of a national centralised referral system. Identical survival at 30, 60 and 180Â days between the accepted patients and the ones deemed too well warrant further investigations.
