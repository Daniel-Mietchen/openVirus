 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Advanced age is associated with increased illness severity leading to an increased mortality when critical care is required. Although the average life expectancy in India is 68 years, and only 0.9 % of the population is above 80 years of age, ICUs in major cities like ours admit a substantial proportion of octagenarians. Since the ICU outcomes of octagenarians in the Indian setting is not known, we conducted this retrospective review.
