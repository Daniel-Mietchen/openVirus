 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> 11.3Â % of all our ICU admissions were octagenarians. Compared to the western population, octagenarians admitted to our ICU seem to have a lower predicted and actual mortality indicating less illness severeity. This could be due to a combination of patient factors, healthcare factors, healthcare delivery location and cultural factors. Published western data may not be helpful for discussing the outcomes with the patient and the family or decision making, before or after ICU admission.
