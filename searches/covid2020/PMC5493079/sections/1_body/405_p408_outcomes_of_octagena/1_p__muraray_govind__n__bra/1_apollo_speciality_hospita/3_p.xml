 <bold>Results:</bold> The average age of octagenarians admitted to our ICU was 84 years. Unlike the rest of the admissions, there were more females (55 %) amongst the octagenarians. Their average APACHE 4 score was 57.6 with a predicted mortality of 13.9 %. This correlated well with the actual mortality of 11.3 %. There was no statistically significant difference between the length of ICU stay or mortality between the octagenarians and the rest of the admissions. The number of cardiac patients between the two groups was also comparable.
