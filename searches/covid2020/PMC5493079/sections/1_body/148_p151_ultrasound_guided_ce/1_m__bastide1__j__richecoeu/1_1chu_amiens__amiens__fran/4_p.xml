 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our survey shows that a large majority of the intensivists still perform landmark procedures while almost every physician received a formation on the ultrasound technique. Ultrasound device is present in the large majority of the institution however their availability is still scarce. Despite the several guidelines, physicians still donâ€™t use ultrasound for every procedure and think that landmark technique should still be taught to residents.
