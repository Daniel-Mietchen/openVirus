 <bold>Introductions:</bold> The use of ultrasound is recommended to secure central venous catheter placement in the ICU. However several surveys showed that only 50 % of the CVC procedures are performed using the ultrasound guided technique. The reason why physicians continue to use landmarks were the lack of formation and the absence of ultrasound device. We designed a survey to elicit information on physician’s characteristics, experience in CVC placement, training on ultrasound technique, the use of ultrasound for CVC placement, reasons for non-use of ultrasound and their opinion on the necessity to continue to teach the landmark technique to residents.
