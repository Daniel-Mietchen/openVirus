<p id="Par2850">We prospectively included all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients admitted in our intensive care unit (ICU) from 2011 to 2014. They were submitted to target temperature management (34 °C) for 24 hours. Outcome was assessed according to the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) at ICU discharge. CPC 1 to 3 was considered as good outcome and CPC 4 to 5 as poor outcome. Recent guideline suggest to sample NSE at 72 hours after cardiac arrest.</p>
