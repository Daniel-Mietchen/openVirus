 <bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a cross-sectional study of adult patients needing NIV, admitted to the ID-ICU between 2010 and 2014. We excluded patients who need NIV with chronic pulmonary disease, acute pulmonary edema or during weaning of mechanic ventilation. The patients were identified by our hospital database and subsequently the clinical records were consulted. The primary outcome was the result of NIV and secondary outcomes were death and its predictors. We used the most appropriate measure of central tendency and distribution and statistical test (significance level 0.05).
