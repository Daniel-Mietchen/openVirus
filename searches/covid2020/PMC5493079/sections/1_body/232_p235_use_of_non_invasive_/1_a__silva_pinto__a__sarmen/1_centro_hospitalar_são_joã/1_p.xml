 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is used with well-defined scientific evidence in acutely decompensated chronic pulmonary disease and acute pulmonary edema. NIV has been also successful in immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates, especially in hematological and pharmacological immunosuppressed patients. The use of NIV remains controversial in pneumonia, tuberculosis, flu, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)â€¦ The aim of this study is to analyse the use of NIV in an Infectious Diseases Intensive/Intermediate Care Unit (ID-ICU).
