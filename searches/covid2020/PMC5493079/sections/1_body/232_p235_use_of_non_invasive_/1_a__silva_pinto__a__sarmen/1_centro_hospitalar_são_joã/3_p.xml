 <bold>Results:</bold> We included 50 patients (34 male) with a median age of 52. The majority (27) were immunosuppressed: 21 patients had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with CD4 count less than 350/mm3, 3 had hematological neoplasia under chemotherapy, 2 were under immunosuppressant drugs, and 2 had solid neoplasia under chemotherapy. The median APACHE II score was 19 and SAPSII score was 43. Eight patients had a “do not intubate” status due to their comorbidities. The most frequent reason to perform NIV was bacterial pneumonia (44 %) followed by pneumocystosis (30 %), ARDS (16 %), flu (6 %) and tuberculosis (2 %). Median time of NIV was 3,5 days. We had a NIV success rate of 60 % (14 patients were intubated, 5 did not have intubation indication and 1 patient died from another cause). The mortality rate was 28 %. We found statistically significant association between the severity scores SAPSII and APACHE and the NIV result and death (higher scores were associated with failure of NIV and death). We also found that patients with hematological neoplasia under chemotherapy had higher rates of failure of NIV and death. HIV infection was associated with death but not with NIV failure.
