 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Sepsis is known to be associated with impaired platelet function (1). The PFA-100 (Siemens Healthcare, Dade International, Miami, Fla., USA) is a device in which a citrated whole blood sample is aspirated through an aperture coated with agonists inducing platelet activation. Platelet aggregation leads to occlusion of the aperture and blood flow ceases over an interval termed the closure time (CT).
