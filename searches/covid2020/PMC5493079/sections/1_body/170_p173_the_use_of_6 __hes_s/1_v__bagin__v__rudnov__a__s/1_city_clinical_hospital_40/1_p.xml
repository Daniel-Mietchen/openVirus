 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Burn injury is included in the list of contraindication to HES use, but there is no convincing evidence base to such statement because of the small population of burn patients and absence of high-quality studies. Aim of this study was to access the efficacy and safety of HES in the therapy of patients with burn shock.
