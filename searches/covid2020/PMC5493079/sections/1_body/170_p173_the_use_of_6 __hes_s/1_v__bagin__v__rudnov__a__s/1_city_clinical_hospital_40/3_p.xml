 <bold>Results:</bold> Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. Hospital mortality was not significantly different: 45,8 % and 28,0 % in HES group and control group, respectively, p = 0,31. Rate of AKI was 29,2 % in HES group and 20,5 % in control group, p = 0,5201. 2 patients in HES group and 1 patient in control group required RRT. Independent risk factors for AKI were TBSA burned (OR 1,09 (1,01-1,19), p = 0,04), index Baux (OR 1,09 (1,01-1,19), p = 0,02) and need for catecholamines (OR 12,7 (1,2-144,9), p = 0,04). There wasn’t significant difference between groups in total volume of fluids administered in the first 3 days (Image 1).
