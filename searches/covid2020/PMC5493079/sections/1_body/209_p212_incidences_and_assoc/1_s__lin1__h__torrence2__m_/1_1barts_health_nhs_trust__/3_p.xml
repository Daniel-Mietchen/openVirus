 <bold>Results:</bold> 858 patients admitted to the ICU after major trauma were included in the study, 81 % were male. Median Age was 41 (IQR: 27-56), median New Injury Severity Score was 34 (22-50) and median ICU admission APACHE-2 was 12 (8-16). Overall, AKI incidence was 16 %. AKI was associated with greater hospital mortality (33 % vs. 16 % p &lt; 0.001) and hospital length of stay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig45" ref-type="fig">45</xref>). In multivariable logistic regression, accounting for illness severity scoring AKI remained associated with increased in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.9, 1.2-3.2) however when broken down by AKI category only AKI-3 was significantly associated (OR = 3.4, 1.6-7.3).
