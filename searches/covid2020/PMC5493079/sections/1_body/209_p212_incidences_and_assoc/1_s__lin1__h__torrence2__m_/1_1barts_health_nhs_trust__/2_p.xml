 <bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective, single centre observatory study of major trauma admissions to the Royal London Hospital Adult Critical Care Unit over a 30-month period to assess the incidence and associations of AKI in this population. AKI was defined by the related KDIGO definitions using creatinine criteria. Trauma-related AKI was defined as AKI by the KDIGO creatinine criteria occurring in the seven days after admission. In the absence of known baseline creatinine the admission value was used.
