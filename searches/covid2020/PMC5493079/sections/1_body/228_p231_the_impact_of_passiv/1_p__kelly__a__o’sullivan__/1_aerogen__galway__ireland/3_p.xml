 <xref rid="Fig53" ref-type="fig">53</xref>. A ventilator (SERVO-i®, Maquet) was operated with the conditions- Vt 500 mL, 15BPM, I:E 1:2 and PEEP 5 cm.H2O, with a heated pass-over humidifier (Fisher &amp; Paykel) with heated-wire circuit attached to an 6.5-mm inner-diameter endotracheal tube (ETT)(Flexicare). The absolute filter (Respirgard 303, Baxter) was positioned elevated to the distal tip of the ETT. The HH conditions were 38 ± 1 °C. For Passive humidification conditions, the PH were pre-conditioned for 4 hours under heated and humidified conditions. A vibrating-mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo, Aerogen) was used. A nominal dose of 2.5 mL of Salbutamol (2 mg/mL) was used. The mass of drug eluted from the filters was determined using UV spectroscopy. 3 commercially available PH were used, Ultipor100 (Pall) and Filta-Therm (Intersurgical) compatible with AT, while the Airlife (Carefusion) was not approved for use with AT.
