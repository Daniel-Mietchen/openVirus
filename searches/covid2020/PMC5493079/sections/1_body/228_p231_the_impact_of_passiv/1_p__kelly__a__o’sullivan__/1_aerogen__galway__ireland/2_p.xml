<p id="Par2230">The prevalence of PH usage during invasive mechanical ventilation where the upper airway is bypassed is on the increase due to their low cost and ease of use [1-2]. However PH are not without their limitations. These include blockages and aerosol therapy (AT) associated issues [3-4]. PH manufacturers have identified the restraint of use with AT as a major area for development. Bypass PH for use with AT have been developed by Smiths-Medical, Hudson RCI and Carefusion. Other companies have developed non-bypass PH that are compatible with AT, such as Pall and Intersurgical.</p>
