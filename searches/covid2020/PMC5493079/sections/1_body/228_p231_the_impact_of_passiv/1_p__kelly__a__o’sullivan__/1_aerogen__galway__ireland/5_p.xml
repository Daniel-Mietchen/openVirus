 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The largest aerosol dose delivered was at position B. Position A, C and D aerosol dose delivered were comparable. When the PH was placed between the Wye and the Nebulizer (position D), the delivered dose was unchanged when compared to position C (p-value between 0.298 - 0.488), suggesting that the inclusion of a PH has minimal effect on aerosol delivery.
