 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pattern of organ dysfunctions in severe sepsis patients differ depending on the coding strategy used. Hypotension and the direct code for septic shock is coded in a similar percentage of patients, but in much fewer cases compared to a prospective cohort study of ICU patients. The quality of organ dysfunction coding has substantial influence on the accuracy of coding strategies for severe sepsis in administrative data and therefore requires further evaluation.
