 <bold>Methods:</bold> Severe sepsis patients (&gt;18 y) were identified in a nation-wide database of hospital discharge data (DRG statistics) using ICD-10 codes for I) sepsis + organ dysfunction (explicit coding strategy) and II) infection + organ dysfunction (implicit coding strategy). Explicit sepsis codes included 26 ICD-codes. Infection codes were adapted from Angus et al. (2001, Crit Care Med). Organ dysfunctions were identified by 27 organ failure codes. Septic shock was defined by code R57.2, introduced in 2010. Comparative organ dysfunction data was extracted from a German ICU cohort study (1).
