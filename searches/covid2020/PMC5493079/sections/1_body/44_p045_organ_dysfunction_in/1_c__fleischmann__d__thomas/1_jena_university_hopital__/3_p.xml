 <bold>Results:</bold> Between 2007-2013, we identified I) 941 957 severe sepsis patients using explicit and II) 4 785 511 severe sepsis patients using implicit coding strategies, including 18,2 % and 3,5 % of patients with septic shock, respectively (112 787 patients 2010-2013). Respiratory failure was the leading organ dysfunction coded (56,4 % of explicitly vs. 59,6 % of implicitly identified cases). Renal failure was identified more often when using explicit coding strategies (44,7 % vs. 26,5 %). This was also true for coagulopathy (23,5 % vs. 12,5 %) and metabolic alterations (13,1 vs. 6,1 %). Hypotension was coded in 18,7 % (explicit) and 5,1 % (implicit) of cases. Compared to a prospective cohort of ICU patients with severe sepsis, distribution of organ dysfunctions was similar to the one identified by explicit coding strategies (respiratory failure: 52 %, renal failure: 42,2 %, encephalopathy: 27,7 %, coagulopathy: 22,2 %, metabolic acidosis: 17,8 %, septic shock 50,8 %).
