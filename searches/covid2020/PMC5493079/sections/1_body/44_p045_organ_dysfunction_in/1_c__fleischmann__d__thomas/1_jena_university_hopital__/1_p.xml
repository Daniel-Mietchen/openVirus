 <bold>Introduction:</bold> In administrative data, severe sepsis cases can be identified by different ICD code abstraction strategies. Comparing those strategies, there is a substantial variability in incidence and mortality of severe sepsis depending on the codes used. To understand which mechanisms depend the precision of case identification, we aimed to investigate coding of organ dysfunction in patients with severe sepsis hospitalized in Germany between 2007-2013 comparing administrative coding with prospective data from a national cohort study.
