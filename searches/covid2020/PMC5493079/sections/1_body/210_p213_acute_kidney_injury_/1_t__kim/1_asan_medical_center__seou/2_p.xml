 <bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective cohort study in a single center. Among 386 patients who visited emergency department from January 2012 to December 2013, 322 patients with trauma were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups, patients who developed AKI (n = 301) or not (n = 21), to compare the clinical data. We conducted multivariable logistic regression to independent predictors for AKI and mortality.
