 <bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a single centre pilot study nested within a multicentre, double-blind, cluster-randomised, double crossover trial. All adult heart surgery patients who required crystalloid fluid therapy in ICU as part of the SPLIT trial [1] were eligible. The primary outcome was chest drain output from time of arrival to ICU until 12 hours post operatively. The key secondary outcomes were total volume of fluid in chest drains from arrival to ICU until 24 hours if still in ICU and proportions of patients requiring any of the following blood products (packed red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate).
