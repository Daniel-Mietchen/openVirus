 <bold>Results:</bold> ICUs were mostly medical or medical-surgical (n = 60, 86 %) and located in private hospitals (n = 66, 94 %). Median number of cancer patients per center was 110 (IQR 58-154), corresponding to 16 % (9 %-25%) of all ICU admissions. Median SAPS 3 score was 47 (36-59) points; mechanical ventilation (MV) was used in 21 % of the patients. ICU and hospital mortality rates were 15.9 % and 25.4 %, respectively. Adjusting for relevant patients’ characteristics (age, MV use, admission diagnosis, cancer type, performance status, comorbidities, neutropenia), the presence of clinical pharmacist in the ICU (OR = 0.67 (95 % CI, 0.49-0.90), the number of protocols (OR = 0.92 (0.87-0.98)) and daily meetings between oncologists and ICU team (OR = 0.69 (0.52-0.91)) were associated with lower mortality. Conversely, mortality was higher in ICU holding training programs in critical care (OR = 1.38 (1.05-1.81)). The number of protocols (OR = 1.52 (1.11-2.07)) and meetings between oncologists and ICU team (OR = 4.70 (1.15-19.22)) were also independently associated with a more efficient resource use (both low SMR and SRU). Admission to ICUs in cancer centers compared to general hospitals and annual case-volume had no impact on mortality or resource use.
