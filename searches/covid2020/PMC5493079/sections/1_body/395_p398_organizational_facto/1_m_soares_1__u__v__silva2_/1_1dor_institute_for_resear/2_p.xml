 <bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective cohort study of 9,946 cancer patients (solid = 8,956; hematological = 990) (surgical = 4,929; medical = 5,017) admitted to 70 ICUs (51 located in general hospitals and 19 in cancer centers) during 2013. We retrieved clinical and outcome data from an electronic ICU quality registry (Epimed Monitor System). We surveyed ICUs regarding hospital and ICU structure, organization, staffing patterns and process of care. We used multilevel logistic regression analysis to identify characteristics associated with hospital mortality. We evaluated efficiency in resource use using standardized mortality rates (SMR) and resource use (SRU) based on the SAPS 3 score.
