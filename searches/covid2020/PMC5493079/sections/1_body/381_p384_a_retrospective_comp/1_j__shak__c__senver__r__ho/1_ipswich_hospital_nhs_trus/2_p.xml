<p id="Par3516">Depending on CCU bed pressures, patients booked for elective post-operative admission are assessed in the recovery room for suitability to return to a general ward. The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of all patients who were identified as high risk, thus being booked for post-operative CCU admission, thereby identifying those who do benefit from CCU admission and those safe for care on the ward.</p>
