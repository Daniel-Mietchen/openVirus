<p id="Par3519">Overall length of stay was significantly longer in those admitted to CCU compared to ward, (mean 11 vs 5 days, p = 0.00006). There were also more post-operative complications; 64 events in 42 patients vs 12 events in 11 patients. 6 of 100 patients admitted to CCU required subsequent readmission. 1 of 49 patients returned to the ward was admitted to CCU day 1 post-operatively. Thus, only 26 of 149 CCU bed requests resulted in admission with Level 2 or 3 interventions.</p>
