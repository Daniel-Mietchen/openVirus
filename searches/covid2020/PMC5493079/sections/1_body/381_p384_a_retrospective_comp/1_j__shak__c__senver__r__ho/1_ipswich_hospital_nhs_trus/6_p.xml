 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study suggests that patient demographics and comorbid state have little influence on the eventual post-operative care pathway in this patient cohort. Rather, an objective assessment in the recovery room effectively identified patients with a shorter length of stay and fewer post-operative complications.
