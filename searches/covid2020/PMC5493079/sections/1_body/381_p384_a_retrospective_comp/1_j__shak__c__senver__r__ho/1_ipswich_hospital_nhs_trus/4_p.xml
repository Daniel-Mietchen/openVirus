 <bold>Results:</bold> Of 149 CCU bed requests made, 100 cases were admitted to CCU, 49 cases returned to the ward following anaesthetist or intensivist assessment. There was no significant difference in age between the two groups (mean 72.9 vs 75.6 years, p = 0.16). There was no significant difference in comorbid state, quantified using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (mean score 2.55 vs 2.31, p = 0.24). Of all surgical specialities, colorectal patients were most likely to be admitted to CCU.
