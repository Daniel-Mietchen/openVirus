 <bold>Results:</bold> One hundred and eighteen patients formed the cohort; 52 in sepsis-non AKI, 43 in sepsis-AKI, 23 in control group. Admission urine IGFBP-7 predicted septic AKI development with 72 % sensitivity and 70 % specificity for a threshold level of 2.5 ng/ml with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95 % CI:0.70-0.88). No impact of sepsis was observed on urine IGFBP-7 levels in the absence of AKI. In septic AKI group Urine IGFBP-7 levels continuously increased upto the day of AKI development and high levels suspended for 10 days further. If it continued to be &gt; = 4.7 ng/ml after 7 days of AKI than it predicted mortality with 83 % sensitivity and 82 % specificity (p = 0.009,AUC:0.894,95%CI: 0.742-1.046). But it was not one of the significant predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis.
