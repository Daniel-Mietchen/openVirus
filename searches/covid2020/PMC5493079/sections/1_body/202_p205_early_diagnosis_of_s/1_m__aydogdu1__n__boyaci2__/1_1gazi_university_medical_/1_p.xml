 <bold>Introduction:</bold> An ideal biomarker for early diagnosis of septic acute kidney injury (AKI) should reflect renal damage at cellular level. The aim of this study is to assess and compare the role of a urinary cell cycle arrest marker, insulin like growth factor binding protein-7 (IGFBP-7) in early diagnosis of septic AKI in adult critical care patients. Besides, its role in mortality prediction was also evaluated.
