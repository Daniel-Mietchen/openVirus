 <bold>Methods:</bold> A panel of clinical experts developed a sepsis measure set with the aid of BMJ evidence &amp; identified a study population using 25 ICD10 sepsis codes. Patients with a sepsis code on discharge had their initial care examined against a series of evidence-based interventions. An Appropriate Care Score (ACS) measured compliance with the sepsis care measure set. The project is promoted by an ongoing series of collaborative events, where performance is published &amp; best practice is shared. A healthy sense of competition drives improvement in performance &amp; commissioners are able to monitor performance in their locality.
