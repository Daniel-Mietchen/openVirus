Inclusion criteria included all patients who were enterally fed. Exclusion criteria included parenteral nutrition, less than 4 days of enteral nutrition and incomplete data. Protein provision was measured against 1.2 g/kgBW/d. Propofol was not recorded which was a limitation of the Audit. The Audit was not subject to ethical approval according to Trust standards.</p>
