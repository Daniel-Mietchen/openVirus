 <bold>Methods:</bold> We studied 137 Spanish patients who developed flu (80.3 % by H1N1pdm virus). Diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of Influenza virus in nasopharyngeal swabs using the Real-Time polymerase chain reaction. Immmunoglobulins and IgG subclasses (Binding Site Human IgG Subclass kits) were measured in both acute and convalescent phase and their correlation with severity was examined. We analyzed genetic variants at IGHG2 in order to evaluated their role in the IgG2 levels. Clinical and immunological characteristics were compared using the Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test when needed.
