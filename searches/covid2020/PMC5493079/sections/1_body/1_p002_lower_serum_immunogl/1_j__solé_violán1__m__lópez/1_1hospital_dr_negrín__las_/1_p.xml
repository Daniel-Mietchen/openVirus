 <bold>Introduction:</bold> IgG2 deficiency has been suggested to predispose to severe H1N1 infection (1). However, contradictory findings have been reported (2) and, therefore, further replication of these findings in different cohorts need to be performed. The purpose of this study is to assess the immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses levels, in a cohort of patients with influenza.
