 <bold>Results:</bold> Ninety-three patients were hospitalized and 49 required admission to intensive care unit. Sixty-four patients developed viral pneumonia and 26 acute respiratory distress syndrome. No differences in the serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM or IgG subclasses were observed in the different subgroups according to severity of disease. Genotype G2m n-/n- was associated with lower serum IgG2 levels in the convalescent phase. Patients homozygous for the G2m(n-) allele had significantly lower serum IgG2 levels (256.7 +/- 121.3 mg/dL, N = 16) than individuals carrying the G2m(n-) allele (n+/n- and n-/n- genotypes, 334,5 +/- 120,4 mg/dL, N = 31) (p = 0.042). However no association of IgG2m genotypes and severity of flu was observed.
