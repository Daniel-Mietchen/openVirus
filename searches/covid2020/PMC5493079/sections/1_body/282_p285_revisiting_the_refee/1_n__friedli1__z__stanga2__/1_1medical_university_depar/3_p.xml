 <bold>Results:</bold> Out of 2206 potential abstracts, 44 records with a total of 6269 patients were included in the final analysis including 2 interventional studies and 16 studies including anorexic patients. Definitions for refeeding syndrome were highly heterogenous with most studies relying on electrolyte disturbances only and others also including clinical symptoms. Incidence rates varied between 0 % and 80 % depending on the definition and patient population. Occurrence was mostly within the first 72 hours of start of therapy. Most of the risk factors are in accordance with the NICE guidelines, but older age and enteral feeding were additionally described. Associations of refeeding syndrome and adverse outcomes remain unclear, as does the effect of preventive measures and treatment algorithms.
