 <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 171 patients were included; 88 patients in group 1 and 83 in group 2. Median compliance with all aspects of the bundle was 60 % for group 2. Mortality was 43.6 % in group 1 compared to 38.6 % in group 2 (p = 0.64). Median APACHE II scores were similar and duration of cardiovascular support was not significantly different between the two groups. Length of ICU stay (median [interquartile range]) was longer in group 2 at 6 days [3-12] compared to 3 [1-7] (p &lt; 0.001) however this significance was lost when non-survivors were excluded. There was a significantly lower requirement for RRT amongst ICU survivors in group 2 at 15.7 % compared to 34 % (p = 0.0078).
