 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We have shown a significant improvement in rate of RRT associated with implementation of our sepsis resuscitation bundle. Whilst implementation of care bundles has been associated with improved patient outcome, the basis of this relationship remains unclear [2]. Our work fails to demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality however we acknowledge the limitations of a small sample size. Median bundle compliance is higher than in other published work [2] however ongoing quality improvement work may increase this further. We identified a longer length of stay in group 2. This may represent either a longer period of treatment before deciding to change the focus of care to palliation or a faster decline in patients within group 1.
