 <sup>TM</sup> database identified patients admitted to our ICU with septic shock, from 2009-2011 (Group 1) and after introduction of the quality improvement bundle from 2014-2015 (Group 2). Patients with a significant underlying renal or vascular diagnosis were excluded. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores (APACHE II) and outcome measures including length of ICU stay, duration of cardiovascular support, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and ICU survival were noted.
