 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The formation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign in 2002 [1] led to the introduction of various sepsis management bundles, with evidence of improved outcome [2]. In 2014 our ICU introduced a quality improvement project to implement our septic shock bundle, encompassing early central line insertion, dynamic fluid boluses, mean arterial pressure &gt;60Â mmHg, measuring central venous oxygen saturations, blood cultures and antibiotics. We aimed to investigate if the introduction of the bundle was associated with improved patient outcomes.
