 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Critical Care (CC) services are in increasing demand but published guidance for triaging admissions may no longer reflect current practice [1-2]. Exercise tolerance and clinical frailty assessment may have a role in assessing patients (pts) referred to CC [3]. We aimed to establish the impact of frailty and other factors on this decision making process.
