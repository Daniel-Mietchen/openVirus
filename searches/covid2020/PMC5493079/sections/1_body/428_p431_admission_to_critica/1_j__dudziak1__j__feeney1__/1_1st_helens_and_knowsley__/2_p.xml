 <bold>Methods:</bold> Referrals to CC were prospectively enrolled in a review cohort. Data included patient demographics, a measure of acute physiological derangement (early warning score, EWS), prior hospital length of stay (LOS), exercise tolerance (ET), functional and dependence status, Canadian Clinical Frailty Scale (CCFS) and comorbidities. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors influencing admission, using STATA 14.1. Results are expressed as median (interquartile range) and odds ratios (OR) for admission with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
