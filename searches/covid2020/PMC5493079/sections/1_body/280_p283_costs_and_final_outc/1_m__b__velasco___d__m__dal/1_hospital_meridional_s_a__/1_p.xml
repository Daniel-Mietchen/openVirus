 <bold>Introduction:</bold> ICU is a local where there is a great concern with cost-benefit ratio. Early enteral nutritional is recommended in cases of critically patients and started within 48Â h of initial treatment, after hemodynamic stabilization. Early Feeding (EF) improves nutritional outcomes, reduces ICU and hospital death, while Delayed Feeding (DF) reduces feeding complications and ICU length stay. Patients survival improves total costs of care and reduces meaningfully in Early Feeding. Our study objectives is if the EF would have influence on costs, length stay, and final outcome in ICU and hospital when compared with the DF.
