<p id="Par1407">Three patients admitted to a university hospital general intensive care unit with radiographically confirmed severe pneumonia underwent bronchoscopy and lavage, with the samples being analysed by both conventional microscopy and culture and nucleic acid extraction. The nucleic extract was then placed on a TAC able to detect 48 microbial genes using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), directed towards a range of established respiratory pathogens. Results are available with a time to threshold value which gives an indication of the abundance of that gene in the sample.</p>
