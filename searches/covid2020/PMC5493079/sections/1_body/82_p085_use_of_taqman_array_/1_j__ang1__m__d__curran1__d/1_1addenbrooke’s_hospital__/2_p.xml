Even when an organism is identified, the delay in obtaining results is typically 48 to 72Â hours. Both theses factors can lead to unnecessary antibiotics, and of even greater concern, inappropriate initial therapy. Molecular diagnostic techniques have the potential to address both these problems. We present here three cases which illustrate the utility of molecular diagnostics, using a Taqman array card (TAC).</p>
