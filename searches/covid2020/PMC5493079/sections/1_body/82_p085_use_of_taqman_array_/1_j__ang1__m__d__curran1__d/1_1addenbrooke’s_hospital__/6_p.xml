<p id="Par1409">The cases occurred amongst three adults (age range 19-49) who presented with clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Two cases were community -acquired with the third being hospital-acquired. The organisms identified by the TAC were 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Aspergillus spp. Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> and 
 <italic>Pneumocystis jiroveci</italic> (PCJ), with one patient having two organisms detected. 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> and PCJ were not identified on standard cultures, whilst 
 <italic>Crytposporidum</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus spp</italic> and were both identified on conventional culture/microscopy 5Â days after TAC identification. In all three cases, the results of the TAC assay resulted in change in management, with institution of new antimicrobials targeting the organisms identified combined with rationalisation of pre-existing antimicrobial treatments.
