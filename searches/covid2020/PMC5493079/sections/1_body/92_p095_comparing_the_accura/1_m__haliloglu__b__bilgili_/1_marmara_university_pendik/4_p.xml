 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The biomarkers, PCT, CRP and pro-BNP, can predict mortality in VAP, as can SOFA score. Although, CPIS and CEPPIS has been described as useful scoring systems for diagnosis for VAP, they did no differentiate between survivors and nonsurvivors. In compare to CPIS, CEPPIS, a score based on chest ultrasonography and procalcitonin levels, may be a better predictor of diagnosis of VAP.
