 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Objective tools for prognose assessment may improve treatment strategy. We sought to determine the prognostic value of procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as clinical scores [ Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II), Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), Chest Echography and Procalcitonin Score (CEPPIS) ] in critically ill patients who developed VAP.
