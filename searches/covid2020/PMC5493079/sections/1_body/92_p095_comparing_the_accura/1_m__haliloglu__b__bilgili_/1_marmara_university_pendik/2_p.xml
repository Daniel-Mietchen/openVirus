 <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective study recruited patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the Anesthesiology Department, Marmara University Hospital (Istanbul, Turkey), from January 2014 to September 2015. Patients’ progress was followed until the 28th day after the diagnosis of VAP, when they were considered survivors. Patients who died before the 28th day were non-survivors. Patients discharged from the ICU before the 28th day were also considered survivors. APACHE II score was assessed during first 24 h of admission; CPIS and CEPPIS score were assessed at the onset of VAP (day 1). SOFA score, serum CRP, serum PCT, pro-BNP were assessed on day 1,4, 7 of VAP diagnosis and were correlated with 28-day survival and mortality.
