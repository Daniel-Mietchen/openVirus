 <bold>Introduction:</bold> ESBL and carbapenemase producing gram-negative pathogens pose a major therapeutic challenge to the healthcare providers, both in hospital and in the community. Morbidity, mortality and the cost of health care delivery are all increased by the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, it becomes important to have a good knowledge of local microbial spectrum and sensitivity profile, so appropriate prophylactic antibiotics could be administered. This retrospective review was conducted to assess the prevalence of both ESBL and carbapenemase producers among the uropathogens in a newly opened tertiary care hospital in Chennai, India.
