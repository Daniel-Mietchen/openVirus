 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The incidence of ESBL and carbapenemase production among in-hospital uropathogens is very high at 63 % and 5 % respectively. This confirms the global increase in the incidence of ESBLs and carbapenemases. Although carbapenemase production in the community is only 0.6 %, sepsis caused by these isolates is very difficult to treat with high mortality rates. Appropriate antibiotic use, following a deescalation strategy and good antimicrobial stewardship are very important in improving outcomes and preventing the spread of further resistance. Instead of following the general antibiotic guidelines, developing robust local guidelines based on the microbiological data on antibiotic sensitivity of the organisms to guide prophylaxis will be helpful in achieving high rates of clinical cure.
