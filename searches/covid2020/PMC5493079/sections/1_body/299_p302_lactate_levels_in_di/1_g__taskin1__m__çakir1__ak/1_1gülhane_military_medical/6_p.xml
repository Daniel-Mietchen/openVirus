<p id="Par2701">The mean age of patients with DKA was 50.4 ± 24.1 and 45.2 % (n = 14) of them were men and 54.8 % (n = 17) were women. Twelve (38.7 %) of patients had type 1 diabetes and 19 (61.3 %) had type 2. The mean serum lactate was 2.93 ± 1.81 mmol/L (0.89–9.20). Of 31 patients, 14 (45.2 %) had elevated serum lactate levels (&gt;2.5 mmol/L), and 6 (19.4 %) had high lactate levels (&gt;4 mmol/L). No correlation was found between serum lactate levels and mortality, length of ICU and hospital stay. Besides, lactate levels were not correlated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, blood pressure, serum glucose and HbA1C levels.</p>
