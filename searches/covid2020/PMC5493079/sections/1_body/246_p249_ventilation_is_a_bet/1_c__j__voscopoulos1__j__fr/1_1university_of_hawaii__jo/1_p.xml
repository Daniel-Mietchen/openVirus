 <bold>Introduction:</bold> ICU patients require multiple monitoring inputs to optimize care &amp; are subjected to many discomfort-causing interventions.. Direct measurement of respiratory effort in non-intubated patients is difficult, so clinicians rely on secondary indicators of respiratory sufficiency, such as pulse oximetry &amp; capnography (EtCO2), which have significant limitations. Clinicians often resort to using respiratory rate (RR) measurements from the capnograph. We used a novel non-invasive respiratory volume monitor (RVM), which measures minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume (TV) &amp; respiratory rate (RR), to assess the ability of EtCO2-generated RR to quantify respiratory status in non-intubated patients.
