 <bold>Methods:</bold> Continuous RVM &amp; capnography data were collected from 50 subjects (age:46 ± 14 yrs) using an impedance-based RVM (ExSpiron) &amp; capnograph (Capnostream 20) with a sampling oral/nasal cannula (Smart Capnoline Plus). Each subject performed 6 2.5-min breathing trials at various RRs. The correlations between EtCO2 measurements (low: &lt;35 mmHg, normal: 35-45 mmHg, high: &gt;35 mmHg), capnography-based RR (low: &lt;6 b/min, adequate: &gt; = 6 b/min), &amp; RVM-based MV (low: &lt;2 L/min, adequate: &gt; = 2 L/min) were evaluated.
