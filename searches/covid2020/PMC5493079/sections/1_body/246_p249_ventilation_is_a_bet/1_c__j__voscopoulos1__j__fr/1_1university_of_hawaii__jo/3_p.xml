 <bold>Results:</bold> Comparison of MV &amp; EtCO2 measurements revealed that in only 24.6 % of the 9324 analyzed epochs did adequate MV coincide with normal EtCO2. 68.7 % of the time adequate MV coincided with low EtCO2, &amp; 100 % of low MV corresponded to either normal or low EtCO2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig63" ref-type="fig">63a</xref>). Correlation was poor between the capnograph’s RR &amp; EtCO2 measurements: normal EtCO2 coincided with adequate RR just 24.9 % of the time &amp; none of the low RR measurements were revealing of a high EtCO2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig63" ref-type="fig">63b</xref>). When using RR as a proxy for MV it was also noted that low MV is observed at a wide range of RRs, with only 15.5 % of all low MV events captured by a low EtCO2-based RR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig63" ref-type="fig">63c</xref>).
