 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Around 50% of deaths in the UK occur in hospital, giving a total of around 250 000 in 2013 [1]. The responsibility of confirmation and documentation of these deaths rests across all specialties of hospital doctor. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AMRC) released a consensus guideline in 2008 aiming to standardise this process [2]. Guidance is available for the diagnosis of death following cardiorespiratory arrest and death following cessation of brainstem function. The diagnosis should be transparent, consistent and instil public confidence in the process. This audit took a retrospective look at current practice and adherence to these guidelines.
