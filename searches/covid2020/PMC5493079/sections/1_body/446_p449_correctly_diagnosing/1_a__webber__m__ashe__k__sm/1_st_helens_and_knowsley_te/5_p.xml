 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Despite AMRC consensus guidelines being available for best practice in diagnosis of death, there remains a great deal of variation in practice for this common procedure. Only 1% of the case notes examined met the guidelines, with the majority not observing the patient for long enough or documenting a corneal reflex. Furthermore, 20% of cases were found to have documented the time/date of death incorrectly. We propose that these wide variations in practice can easily be addressed with the introduction of a standardised proforma to be completed and signed by the clinician at the time of verification.
