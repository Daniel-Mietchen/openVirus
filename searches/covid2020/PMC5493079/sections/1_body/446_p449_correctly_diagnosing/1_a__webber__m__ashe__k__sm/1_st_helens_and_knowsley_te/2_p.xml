 <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective case notes examination was carried out between February and August 2015. 98 deaths were observed on Whiston ICU during this period. Doctors carrying out the reviews were not involved in the process of diagnosing death in order not to bias the study findings. Data was collected from entries made in the patientâ€™s case notes and compared with recommended standards set out within AMRC guidelines. These include absence of heart and breath sounds, central pulse and corneal reflex. The patient should have been observed for 5 minutes and the time and date entered in the patient record, along with the name/grade of doctor.
