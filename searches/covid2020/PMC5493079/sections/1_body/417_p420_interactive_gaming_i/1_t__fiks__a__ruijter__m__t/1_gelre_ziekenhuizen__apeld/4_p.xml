<p id="Par3736">The mile™ bed-cycle device was used routinely since October 2015 with interesting results. Patients could choose the environment where they wanted to cycle around, e.g. “slot Zeist”, in the woods or using a water-cycle in the colourful village of Giethoorn. In parallel to the observation with the Wii device, patients liked the variety in scenes best. A study is in progress evaluating safety, as well as effects on motivation of patients using these interactive games in the ICU.</p>
