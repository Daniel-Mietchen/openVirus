 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Light sedation has gained attention as part of standard daily care in the intensive care unit (ICU). Particularly early mobilization is associated with shorter time on the ventilator, shorter ICU length of stay and better survival. Interactive gaming may be a challenging way of engaging the patient in his own rehabilitation program. Few data are available for the use of these interactive games in the ICU envirnoment as part of daily routine physiotherapy, although one study showed that it was safe [1].
