 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Both in nondiluted and diluted TCP blood: (1) fibrinogen and FEIBA synergistically improve clot quality (firmness); (2) fibrinogen alone does not increase clot resistance to fibrinolysis but potentiates such effect of FEIBA if added in combination. Both agents could serve as alternative therapeutic approach to bleeding patients with severe TCP.
