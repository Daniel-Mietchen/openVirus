 <sup>-1</sup>] was created by mixing platelet-poor plasma with packed cells. The samples were diluted or not to 60 % with TRIS/saline buffer and subjected to clotting in the presence of tPA. Blood was spiked with fibrinogen (3.0 mg/mL) and/or FEIBA (1 U/mL). Maximum clot firmness (MCF, mm) and lysis onset time (LOT, min) were evaluated using rotational thromboelastometry and presented as Mean ± SD.
