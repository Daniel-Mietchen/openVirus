 <bold>Results:</bold> MCF in nondiluted TCP blood was 18 ± 5. Spiking the blood with fibrinogen and FEIBA increased it to 29 ± 4 and 27 ± 7, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Combined use of these agents increased MCF to 34 ± 4 (P &lt; 0.01). Dilution of TCP blood reduced MCF to 9 ± 5 (P &lt; 0.001). Spiking diluted blood with fibrinogen increased MCF to 15 ± 4 (P &lt; 0.01), spiking with FEIBA increased it to 22 ± 4 (P &lt; 0.01), and combination of both agents had the greatest effect on MCF that reached 30 ± 6 (P &lt; 0.01) and did not differ from its level in nondiluted blood following combined spiking. LOT in nondiluted TCP blood was 13.1 ± 5.1. Spiking the blood with fibrinogen had no effect on LOT while spiking with FEIBA prolonged it to 21.5 ± 7.3 (P &lt; 0.05). Combined use of both agents further increased LOT to 33.0 ± 4.6 (P &lt; 0.01). Dilution of blood as well as spiking diluted blood with fibrinogen had no significant effect on LOT while spiking with FEIBA prolonged it to the same extent as in non-diluted blood (P &lt; 0.05). Compared to FEIBA, combination of both agents slightly prolonged LOT, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.
