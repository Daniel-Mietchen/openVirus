 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Bleedings in severe thrombocytopenia (TCP) vary from mild to severe and may be even life-threatening when accompanied with hemodilution as a result of trauma and subsequent fluid resuscitation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fibrinogen and activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA) on clot quality and resistance to fibrinolysis in a model of TCP and hemodilution.
