 <bold>Methods:</bold> Data on patients with confirmed cirrhosis admitted to a general ICU at a major university hospital between 2008 and 2014 were retrospectively collected from medical records. Scores were calculated for CLIF-Consortium Organ Failure score (CLIF-C OF, a shortened version of CLIF-SOFA), CLIF-C ACLF (includes age and white cell count), RFH, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II). The main outcome was mortality in ICU. Predictive accuracy and calibration was assessed using area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) and goodness-of-fit Ï‡ statistic.
