 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Mortality of patients with cirrhosis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) has been reported to be as high as 60Â %. Recently, a number of scoring systems have been developed in order to predict mortality in tertiary liver units, including CLIF-SOFA-based scoring systems and Royal Free Hospital (RFH) tool, however, none of them has been validated in patients admitted to general ICU [1]. The aim of the study is to validate the new measures and compare with established prediction models.
