 <bold>Results:</bold> 118 patients were identified (mean age 50.6 years, 66.9 % male). ICU mortality was 54.2 %. Alcoholic liver disease was the main aetiological factor present in 91.5 % of the patients. 56 % of patients were admitted to ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding. All measures were well calibrated (χ &gt;0.2, p &gt; 0.05), particularly CLIF-OF (χ =1.3, p = 0.93). Accuracy of the novel models was generally not superior to the established scores (AUROC values: CLIF-OF 0.68; CLIF-ACLF 0.68; RFH 0.72 vs. APACHEII 0.65; MELD 0.71). Bilirubin, creatinine and platelets were found to be independent predictors of mortality in a multivariate logistic model. The accuracy of creatinine alone was higher than any of the prediction models (AUROC 0.85, χ =8.4, p = 0.35).
