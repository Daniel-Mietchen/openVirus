 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> RHF and MELD scores have the best predictive accuracy. However, complex and specialised measures do not offer advantage in predicting mortality over MELD and routinely available APACHEII score in cirrhotic patients admitted to general ICU. Creatinine alone is a robust prognostic indicator of mortality. Simplified scores encompassing few variables may offer similar accuracy, but higher utility.
