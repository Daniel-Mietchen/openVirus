 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our incidence of AKI is much lower than that reported in the literature and a retrospective study demonstrated the rate of AKI to be 14.8Â % after elective orthopaedic surgery [2]. It is possible that this may be secondary to the routine post-operative admission of patients with risk factors to the HDU environment. Risk factors found to be associated with AKI were consistent with the results of previous studies [3]. Even Stage 1 AKI resulted in an increased mortality at one year. Interpretation of our findings is limited by confounding. Early recognition of risk factors will aid identification of patients at increased risk of AKI. Subsequent pre-optimisation and normalisation of reversible risk factors where possible as well as planning of appropriate post-operative care may reduce the burden of AKI.
