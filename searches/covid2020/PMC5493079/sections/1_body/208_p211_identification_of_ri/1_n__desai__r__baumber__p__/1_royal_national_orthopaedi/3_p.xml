 <bold>Results:</bold> Incidence of AKI between 2009 and 2015 was 2.99 % in 8033 patient episodes. All factors other than gender were noticeably associated with AKI. Rate of AKI was 2.7 % in elective cases compared to 10.5 % in urgent cases. Revision surgery was associated with an increased rate of AKI when compared to primary surgery. AKI increased with age and the rate of AKI in patients over the age of 80 was 9.9 %. Development of AKI progressively increased from 0.88 % in ASA 1 to 13.3 % in ASA 4 patients. Pre-operative anaemia and blood transfusion increased the risk of AKI from 2 % to 4.6 % and 2.2 % to 8.9 % respectively. All patients who developed AKI had post-operative anaemia. AKI affected 6.9 % of those patients who were admitted to the HDU while patients not admitted to HDU demonstrated a rate of AKI of 1.7 %. Patients with AKI had a mean LOS of 28.6 days compared to 9.4 days in those without AKI. Patients with no AKI had a mortality of 1.8 % at one year compared with 5.8 %, 6.5 % and 7.7 % in patients with Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 AKI respectively.
