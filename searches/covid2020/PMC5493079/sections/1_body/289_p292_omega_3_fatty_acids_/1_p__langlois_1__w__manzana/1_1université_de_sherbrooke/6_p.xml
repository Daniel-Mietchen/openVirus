<p id="Par2619">A total of 11 RCTs (n = 2846 patients) met inclusion criteria. When the data from 4 trials were aggregated, n-3 PUFA had no effect on ICU LOS (WMD -4.43, 95 % CI -13.43, 4.48, P = 0.34, heterogeneity I2 = 43 %). However, n-3 PUFA were associated with a trend in the reduction of POAF (RR 0.89, 95 % CI 0.76, 1.05, P = 0.17; I2 = 34 %, P = 0.13). In addition, in those oral/enteral based trials, n-3 PUFA showed a tendency towards a reduction in POAF (RR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.74, 1.03, P = 0.11; I2 = 47 %, P = 0.07; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig75" ref-type="fig">75</xref>). The test for subgroup differences on overall POAF showed a trend (P = 0.16). There was no effect of n-3 PUFA on MV days and hospital LOS.
