<p id="Par2617">We included RCTs enrolling adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery, which evaluated oral/enteral and parenteral n-3 PUFA compared to a placebo and reported clinically important outcomes. According to eligibility criteria, original studies were abstracted in duplicate. Intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes were incidence of POAF, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and hospital LOS. Hypothesis-generating subgroup analysis was performed to identify potentially more beneficial treatment strategies.</p>
