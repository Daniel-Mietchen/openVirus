<p id="Par2615">Over the last few years, supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) has emerged as a therapeutic option for patients undergoing cardiac surgery due to their immunomodulatory properties and anti-arrhythmic action. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of data supporting the effectiveness of n-3 PUFA in the treatment of cardiac surgery patients. So far, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed the effect of perioperative n-3 PUFA preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF), although their efficacy still remains controversial. Therefore, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effects of perioperative oral/enteral n-3 PUFA and intravenous (IV) fish oil lipid emulsions on relevant clinical outcomes for cardiac surgery patients.</p>
