 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Botulism is a rare paralytic illness caused by the action of a potent neurotropic exotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. C. botulinum species produce seven serologically distinct toxins, A-G. Human botulism is primarily caused by toxin types A, B or E. In Europe, most wound botulism is now associated with injectable drug use. Symptoms are of descending paralysis, bulbar palsies and respiratory failure.
