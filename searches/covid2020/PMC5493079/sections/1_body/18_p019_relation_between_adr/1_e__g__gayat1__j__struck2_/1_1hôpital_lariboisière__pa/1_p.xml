 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a peptide with 52 amino acids which has strong vasodilator activity. Elevated plasma ADM levels have been detected in a wide variety of physiological and pathological conditions, with the highest elevations observed in septic shock. Marino et al. demonstrated a strong association of admission ADM levels with the severity of sepsis, supporting an earlier report describing elevated ADM levels in those with severe sepsis and those with septic shock [1]. By using a novel assay specific for bioactive ADM (bio-ADM) as Marino et al.the aim of the study was to assess the relation between ADM measured at admission and in-ICU mortality in consecutive patients regardless the cause of admission.
