 <bold>Results:</bold> 2087 patients have been included, 65 % male with a median age of 63 (51-74), a median Charlson score of 3 (1-5) and a median SAPS-II 49 (36-63). Septic shock was present in 488 (23 %) patients. Median (and interquartile range) of ADM in-ICU survivors and non-survivors was 57 pg/mL [30-114] and 110 pg/mL [63-220], respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Hazard ratio of in-ICU death for patients with a level of ADM higher than the median value was 2.12 (95%CI: 1.73-2.60) and 1.68 (95%CI: 1.36-2.07) when adjusted for SAPS-II. Area under the ROC curve of SAPS-II was significantly improved by the addition of ADM (0.653 [0.624 - 0.682] to 0.702 [0.675 - 0.729], p = 0.01).
