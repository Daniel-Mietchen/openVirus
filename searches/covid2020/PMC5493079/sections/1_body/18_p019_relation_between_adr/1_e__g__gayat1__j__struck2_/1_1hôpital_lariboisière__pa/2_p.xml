 <bold>Methods:</bold> The French and euRopean Outcome reGistry in Intensive Care Units (FROG-ICU) study was a multicenter observational study, including 2087 consecutive patients followed up to one year for those who survived to ICU stay. The protocol has previously been described [2]. Plasma were collected at admission for all patients and at discharge for in-ICU survivors. ADM was measured in all plasma using a sandwich assay specific for bio-ADM. The association between in-ICU mortality and the level of ADM was assessed by univariate analysis and adjusted analysis for severity at admission measured by the SAPS-II. Improvement in area under the ROC curve and reclassification indices were assessed.
