 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Dynamic elastance (EaDyn), calculated as the ratio between Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) on Stroke Volume Variation (SSV) has been proposed as a predictor of change in arterial pressure in response to a fluid challenge. We want to assess the predictive value of EaDyn calculated with LiDCOplus cardiac output monitor in post-operative patients.
