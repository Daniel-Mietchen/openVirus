 <bold>Methods:</bold> In this prospective observational study 38 fluid responsive patients were monitored with an arterial catheter, cardiac output (CO) monitor (LiDCOplus). Haemodynamic data was recorded one minute before the fluid challenge and one minute after. 250 mL of crystalloids were infused intravenously over 5 minutes. Changes in mean arterial pressure (∆MAP) systolic arterial pressure (∆Sys) and diastolic arterial pressure (∆Dias) were analysed in a regression models against the values of EaDyn , at baseline, adjusted by baseline values of the haemodynamic of interest (i.e. MAP) and the presence of mechanical ventilation.
