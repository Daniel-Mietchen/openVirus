 <bold>Results:</bold> CCINR correlated well with labINR (r = 0.81, Y = -0.163 + 1.191 X). Moreover, evaluating subgroup whose Ht &lt;30 % (N = 27, mean Ht 24.6 %), correlation was thought to be acceptable (r = 0.706, Y =0.047 + 1.058 X). On the other hand, correlation between ACT and aPTT, widely considered as “the Gold standard h was inferior (r = 0.567, Y =0.047 + 1.058 X).
