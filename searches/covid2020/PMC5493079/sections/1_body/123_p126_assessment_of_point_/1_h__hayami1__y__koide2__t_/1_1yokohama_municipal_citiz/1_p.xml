 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Activated clotting time (ACT) is currently used for dose adjustment of heparin during CPB, and has been thought as gold standard in this field. However, in difficult case, such as prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass, consumption coagulopathy might also occur, and there might be need for blood components. Monitoring ACT only is not adequate in such case. The CoaguChek XS system is a portable instrument for monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy. It determines the PTINR value from a drop of capillary blood specimen, and it has been reported that accuracy seems to be better for hematocrit (Ht) &gt;30Â %. We compared PTINR measured by CoaguChek XS (CCINR) with PTINR analyzed by laboratory test (LabINR) after CPB.
