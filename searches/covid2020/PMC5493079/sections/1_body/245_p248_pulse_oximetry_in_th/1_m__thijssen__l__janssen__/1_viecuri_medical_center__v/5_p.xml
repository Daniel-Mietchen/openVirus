 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We found a clinical relevant lack of agreement between SpO2 and SaO2 measurements. In contrast to general expectations SpO2 exceeds SaO2 in 48.2 % of all measurements. PFI is of little value as differences may be great as even with a high (good) PFI value, 15.9 % of concurrent measurements of SpO2 and SaO2 differ &gt; ±2 %. These findings may influence daily practice on how to adjust mechanical ventilation by SpO2 measurements.
