 <bold>Methods:</bold> In a 5 month period, 281 patients were retrospectively studied resulting in 1281 concomitantly measured values of SpO2 (Philips M1191BL/M1194A), SaO2 and PFI. Inotropic use, pH, MAP, mechanical ventilation and body temperature were studied as independent variables. PFI values were categorized as low or poor with PFI &lt; 1.0, intermediate or moderate with 1.0 &lt; PFI &lt; 2.5 and as reliable or high with PFI &gt; 2.5. Data collection: All SaO2, SpO2 and PFI measurements during the first 3 days after admittance were collected unless the patient was invasively ventilated, then all measurements were collected until extubation. Statistical analysis: A linear correlation of the SpO2 and SaO2 values was assessed by Pearson’s method and the mean SpO2-SaO2 difference (Δ ) was assessed by using the Bland and Altman method.
