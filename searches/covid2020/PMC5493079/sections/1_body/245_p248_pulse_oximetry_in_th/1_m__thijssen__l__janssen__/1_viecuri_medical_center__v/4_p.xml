<p id="Par2341">Over a wide range of PFI values (median 1.4, range 0.1-19.2) we found moderate agreement between SpO2 and SaO2 with slightly better agreement for higher PFI values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig62" ref-type="fig">62</xref>). Even with a PFI &gt; 2.5, 15.9 % of all measurements showed a difference between SpO2 and SaO2 of more than ±2 %. The other independent variables showed only very weak associations (r &lt; 0.2) with the Δ SpO2-SaO2, except for mechanical ventilation (ANOVA p = 0.002).
