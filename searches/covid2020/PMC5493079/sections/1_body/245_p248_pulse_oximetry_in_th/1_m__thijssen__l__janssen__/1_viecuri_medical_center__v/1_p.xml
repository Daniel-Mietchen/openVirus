 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Pulse oximetry (SpO2) is intensively used as a surrogate for arterial oxygenation (SaO2) however, little is known about its accuracy in daily ICU practice. Disturbed perfusion may lead to a poor signal as indicated by a lower perfusion index value (PFI) and so compromise its accuracy. We studied SpO2 accuracy in its relationship to the PFI.
