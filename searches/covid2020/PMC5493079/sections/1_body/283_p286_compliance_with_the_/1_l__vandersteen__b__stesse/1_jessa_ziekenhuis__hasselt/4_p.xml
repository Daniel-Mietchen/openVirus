<p id="Par2560">We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients admitted to a 6-bed medical unit of our ICU from 01/04/2013 to 30/11/2013. From 220 admitted patients, 123 were considered critically ill since they received tight glycaemic control. The other patients were excluded from the analysis since they stayed for less than 24Â hrs in the ICU, mostly for monitoring purposes.</p>
