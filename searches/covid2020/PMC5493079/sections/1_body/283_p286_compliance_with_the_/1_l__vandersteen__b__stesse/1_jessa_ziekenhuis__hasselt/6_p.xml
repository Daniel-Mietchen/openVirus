<p id="Par2562">Only 6 out of 123 patients received PN (4.88 %). In 4 cases PN was started at day 8 after ICU admission in accordance to the new protocol. PN was started earlier in 2 patients suffering from an haematological-oncological disease complicated with neutropenic sepsis and a BMI less than 18 and already receiving PN on the ward. Since a caloric intake less than ¾ of the caloric target at day 3 after ICU-admission was considered a cut-off for starting PN in the old protocol, 88.62 % of the patients would have met the criteria for receiving PN according to that protocol.</p>
