<p id="Par2558">After participating in the EPaNIC trial, we changed the protocol for the administration of parenteral nutrition (PN) in our ICU [1]. The administration of PN supplementing enteral nutrition (EN) in case of insufficient caloric intake, was postponed from day 3 after ICU admission to day 8, compared to the “late-PN-group” in the EPaNIC trial. One of the exceptions is patients with a BMI less than 18, where starting PN depends on the individual decision of the attending intensive care physician. The protocol for the administration of EN and glycaemic control remained unchanged. Micro-nutrients intravenously are prescribed for all patients as from day 3 after ICU admission in case of inadequate caloric intake. Two years after implementing the new protocol, we conducted a survey investigating the compliance with the new protocol.</p>
