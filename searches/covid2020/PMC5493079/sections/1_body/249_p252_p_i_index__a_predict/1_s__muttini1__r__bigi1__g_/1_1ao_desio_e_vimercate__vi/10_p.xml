 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> P/I Index predict ability to sustain SBT under ventilator assistance and during SBT. Subgroup A may represent a group of patients not adequately assisted, where classic indices and NVE are not able to predict the inability to start SBT. Further investigations are needed to understand whether P/I Index may provide information on adequacy of assistance during NAVA ventilation.
