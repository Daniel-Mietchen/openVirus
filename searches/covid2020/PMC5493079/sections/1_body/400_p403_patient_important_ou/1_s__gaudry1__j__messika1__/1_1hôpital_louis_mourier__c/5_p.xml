<p id="Par3632">Ninety-six (63 %) RCTs reported at least one patient-important outcome (either primary or secondary outcomes) but only 17 (11 %) reported at least one patient-centered outcome assessed after ICU discharge. In a multivariate analysis, sepsis as topic (OR, 7.6; 95 % CI, 2.2-25.5) and RCTs with Jadad score &gt; 3 (OR, 4.8; 95 % CI, 2.1-10.7) were more likely to assess at least one patient-important outcome.</p>
