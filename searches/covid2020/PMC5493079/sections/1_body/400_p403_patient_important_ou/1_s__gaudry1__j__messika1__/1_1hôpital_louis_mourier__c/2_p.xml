 <bold>Methods:</bold> Literature searches were conducted in Medline (via PubmedÂ®) to identifiy eligible articles indexed from January 2013 to December 2013.Articles were eligible if they reported an RCT involving critically ill adult patients and were written in English. Data extraction was conducted by 2 independent senior intensivists on a standardized, pre-tested extract form. We assessed patients and study characteristics. All outcomes (primary and secondary) were collected, described and classified using 6 categories of outcomes including patient-important outcomes. Patient-important outcomes were represented by 2 entities: mortality at any time and patient-centered outcomes assessed after ICU discharge (such as quality of life and functional status).
