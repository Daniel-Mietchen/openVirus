 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The mean Ï„ calculated from the regional EIT signals shows a very strong correlation with the global pneumatic volume signal reflecting EIT as a valid method to calculate global and regional expiratory time constants. EIT therefore provides for the first time a regional breath by breath measurement of airflow obstruction and may help to guide mechanical ventilation especially in obstructive pulmonary diseases.
