 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Obstructive airway diseases such as asthma or COPD are increasing in numbers and frequently lead to severe exacerbations with the need of non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Severe COPD in particular is often characterized by inhomogeneous ventilation. In case of mechanical ventilation in obstructive pulmonary diseases or ARDS, modern ICU ventilators provide accurate measurements of pressure-volume curves on a global, but not on a regional level. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in contrast is an established non-invasive tool to measure regional ventilation. The aim of our study was to calculate an EIT-based (32x32 pixel, 50 frames per second) expiratory time constant Ï„ (tau) for each image pixel and a global one for the entire lung and to validate it against a global volume signal measured at the airway opening.
