 <bold>Methods:</bold> In 12 intubated patients with hypoxemic and/or hypercapnic respiratory failure we performed EIT and pneumatic volume measurements (Swisstom BB2, Switzerland) on different PEEP level recording 100 consecutive breaths during steady state conditions with breathing frequencies between 14 and 16/min. Regional breath by breath τ values were obtained by fitting in a nonlinear least square manner an exponential function to the EIT curve of each pixel. The same algorithm was applied to the pneumatic volume curve and correlated with the mean τ of all regional EIT measurements.
