 <bold>Results:</bold> The mean τ calculated from the regional EIT signals showed a strong correlation with the global τ calculated from the pneumatic volume signal. In 2773 breaths Pearson r was 0.8752 (0.8662 to 0.8836) and r2 0.7660. Patients with severe COPD typically showed longer time constants than those with ARDS. The mean τ calculated from the global EIT signals showed a strong correlation with the global τ calculated from the pneumatic volume signal as well (Pearson r: 0.8978).
