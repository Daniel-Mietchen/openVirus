 <bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective review of the electronic database and notes of patients admitted to ICU between January 2012 and October 2014 was undertaken. Patients without a formal palliative diagnosis or with a diagnosis of haematological malignancy, were excluded. Demographics, functional status, current cancer treatment, interventions received, and palliative care team involvement were amongst parameters collected. SAPS II, APACHE II scores and ICU outcome were recorded. STATA 14.1 was used for Logistic regression analyses.
