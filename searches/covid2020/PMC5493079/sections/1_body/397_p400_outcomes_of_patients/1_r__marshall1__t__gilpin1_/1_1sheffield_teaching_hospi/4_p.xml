 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> A high SAPS II score may confer accurate prognostic information in the context of critically unwell palliative cancer patients. Overall ICU mortality was lower than those documented by previous works (47-70Â %), [1][2][3] this may be related to strict triage by both the ICU and oncology teams. Median survival of palliative oncology patients admitted to critical care remains poor.
