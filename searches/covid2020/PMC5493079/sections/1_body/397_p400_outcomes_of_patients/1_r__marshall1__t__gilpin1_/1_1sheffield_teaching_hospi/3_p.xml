 <bold>Results:</bold> 31 patients were identified, median (IQR) age was 68 (62-76) years, 14 (45.2 %) were male, median (IQR) SAPS II score was 56 (53-71). Of 28 patients, where information was available, 18 (64.3 %) had metastatic disease; 16 (61.5 %) were undergoing palliative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, 5 (19.2 %) palliative surgical intervention. Median (IQR) LOS was 3.25 (1.3-5.1) days and 6 (19.4 %) patients had died at CC discharge. Hospital mortality was 29.6 %. Median survival was 7 days in hospital patients and 143 days in patients discharged home. At logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and gender, the only factor associated with mortality at ICU discharge was SAPS II score (OR 0.9, 95%CI 0.8-1, p = 0.046), while length of stay (LOS), type of palliative treatment received prior to ICU admission, metastatic spread, neutropenia, smoking and diabetic status and highest recorded lactate in the 24 hours prior to ICU admission seemed to not be associated with ICU outcome. The lack of statistical significance for these correlations may be related to the small sample size.
