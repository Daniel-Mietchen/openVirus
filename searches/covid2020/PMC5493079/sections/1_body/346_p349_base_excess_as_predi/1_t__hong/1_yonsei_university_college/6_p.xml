<p id="Par3170">A total of 293 patients were enrolled in our study. Among them 96 patients were admitted to ICU. Most common cause of ICU admission was driver traffic accident (n = 25, 26 %). Admission BE associated with significantly ICU admission (p &lt; 0.000). The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of admission BE for predicting ICU admission was 0.63. Also admission BE (odds ratio [OR], 0.904; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.823-0.992; P = 0.033) and ISS (OR, 1.146; 95 % CI, 1.100-1.194; P &lt; 0.000) were determined to be predictors of ICU admission. BE seemed to show a weak correlation for the ISS (R Spearman = -0.30). Admission BE was significantly lower in the group IV than the remaining groups.</p>
