 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> According to our data, there was no statistically significant correlation detected between the percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP and pRBC transfusion. Our data suggest that even though pRBC transfusion may have an impact on immunosuppression and infection disease developing, the impact on the percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP is not statistically significant.
