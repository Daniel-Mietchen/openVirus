 <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 62 critically ill MERS patients were cohorted in 3 ICUs during the outbreak with a peak census of 27 MERS patients on Aug 25, 2015 and the last new case on Sep 13, 2015. Most patients had multiorgan failure requiring support. Eight hospital employees had MERS requiring ICU admission for a median stay of 28 days: 7 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 4 were treated with proning, 4 needed continuous renal replacement therapy and one had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The hospital mortality of ICU MERS patients was 53 % (0 % for the hospital employees). All MERS patients were admitted in single negative pressure rooms, which were promptly increased from 14 to 38 rooms. The nurse-to-patient ratio was ~1.2:1. Infection prevention practices were intensified. For example, the consumption of surface disinfectants and hand hygiene gel increased by ~30 % and an average of 17 N95 masks were used per patient/day. Family visits were restricted to 2 hours/day and the ICU physicians communicated with the next of kin by phone daily. During the outbreak, 2 ICU nurses and 1 physician tested positive for MERS-CoV, had mild disease and recovered fully. Although most ICU staff expressed concerns about acquiring MERS, none refused to report to work. However, 27.0 % of nurses and 18.4 % of physicians working in the MERS ICUs had upper respiratory symptoms, but tested negative for MERS-CoV. The total sick leave duration was 138 days for nurses and 30 days for physicians.
