 <bold>Methods:</bold> This observational study was conducted at a 1000-bed tertiary-care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia which had a MERS-CoV outbreak in Aug-Sep 2015. Our Intensive Care Department covered 5 ICUs with 60 single-bedded rooms. We described qualitatively and, as applicable, quantitatively, the response of intensive care services to the outbreak.
