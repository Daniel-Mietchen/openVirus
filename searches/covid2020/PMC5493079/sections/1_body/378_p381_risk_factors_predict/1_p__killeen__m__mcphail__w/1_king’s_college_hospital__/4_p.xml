 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Prolonged LOS is significantly associated with several measurable patient characteristics. Further work would be required to more accurately characterise risk factors, but validation of similar risk factors could facilitate prospective bed booking in a dedicated post anaesthetic care unit, with those patients who have risk factors for prolonged LOS instead being admitted directly to the general ICU post-operatively.
