 <bold>Results:</bold> With multivariate logistic regression, patients with prolonged LOS were characterised by renal disease (OR 5.564 CI 95 % 1.166-26.546 p = 0.031), high post-operative sodium (OR 1.342 CI 95 % 1.115-1.615 p = 0.002), high pre-operative c-reactive protein (OR 1.036 CI 95 % 1.003-1.070 p = 0.033) and low post-operative c-reactive protein (OR 0.963 CI 95 % 0.929-0.998 p = 0.041), with a c-index of 0.756 (CI 95 % 0.655-0.856 p &lt; 0.0004). Analysing the univariate relationship between each factor and LOS additionally identified the presence of anaemia, malignancy, low albumin and high CCI as significantly associated with a prolonged stay, but these were not validated as significant at the multivariate stage. Age, chronic pulmonary disease and heart failure were not found to be significantly associated with an increased LOS in our cohort.
