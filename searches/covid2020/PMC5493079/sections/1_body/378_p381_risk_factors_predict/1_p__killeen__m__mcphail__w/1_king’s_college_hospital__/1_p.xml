 <bold>Introduction:</bold> This study investigated risk factors for prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) in an elective surgical patient cohort. LOS is an important outcome as a marker of ICU resource consumption, and there is increasing pressure to use beds more efficiently. If we can estimate the common LOS for common ICU patient groups, such as elective procedure patients, and identify risk factors for prolonged LOS in these groups, then beds can be booked in a more prospective way. This could help improve the flow efficiency of these patients through intensive care beds.
