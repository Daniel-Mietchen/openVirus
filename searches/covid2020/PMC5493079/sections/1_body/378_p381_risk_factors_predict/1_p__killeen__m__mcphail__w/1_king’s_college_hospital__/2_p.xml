 <bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective cohort study of 1288 elective surgical patients who stayed on an ICU at King’s College Hospital between the period 1/4/2014 to 31/3/2015. Data was collected for patients including pre-operative and immediate (within 6 hours) post-operative physiology and comorbidities. A Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated for each patient using an ICD-10 specific algorithm. The main outcome, prolonged LOS, was defined as an LOS greater than or equal to the 75th percentile. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify variables significantly associated with prolonged length of stay.
