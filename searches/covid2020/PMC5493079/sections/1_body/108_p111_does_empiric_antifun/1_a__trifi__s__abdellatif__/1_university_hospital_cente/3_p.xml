 <bold>Results:</bold> 83 patients were included. 48 in the EAFT + group and 35 in the EAFT- group. The patient’s baseline characteristics were comparable in severity illness, underlying diseases and risk factors for IC. Moreover, the EAFT + group had a younger age (48 vs 58, p = 0.03) and higher candida score (3.08 vs 2.31, p = 0.01). It has not been demonstrated an improvement of 28-day survival of an EAFT when administered to septic patients without documented fungal infection. These results were in accordance both in crude analysis and after adjusting on APACHE II score, candida score, invasive ventilation and central catheterisation with OR = 0.73 ; CI 95 % [0.28; 1.91]; p value = 0.53. However, improved survival by an EAFT was showed in patients with an APACHEII score &lt; 16: OR = 0.62; CI95% [0.39; 0.97]; p =0.036. Similar results were objectified by the Kaplan-Meier survival curves.
