 <bold>Methods:</bold> a retrospective cohort study. Two groups of septic patients without a documented fungal infection were compared according to whether they were treated or not by an EAFT. Included were hospitalized patients more than seven days that developed a sepsis and even the sepsis origin has not been determined. Excluded were patients treated with an antifungal adapted to documented fungal infection and immunocompromised. The analysis consisted in evaluating the impact of an EAFT on 28-day survival. The analysis was adjusted on the following confounding factors: the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, the candida score, invasive ventilation and central catheterisation.
