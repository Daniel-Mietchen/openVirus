 <bold>Introductions:</bold> The management of invasive candidiasis (IC) remains a major challenge. Delayed antifungal therapy is known as an independent mortality factor in Septic shock attributed to IC [1]. Thus, empiric antifungal therapy (EAFT) can be indicated in septic patients at risk of IC. However, the unreasonable administration of antifungal is implicated in emergence of resistant candida strains [2]. The purpose was to evaluate the impact of an EAFT on 28-day survival in septic patients without documented Candida infection.
