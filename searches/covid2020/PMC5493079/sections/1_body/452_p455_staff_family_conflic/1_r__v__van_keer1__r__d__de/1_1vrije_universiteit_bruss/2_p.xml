 <bold>Methods:</bold> Ethnographic fieldwork was done in 1 ICU of a multi-ethnic urban hospital in Belgium. During 6 months, data were collected through negotiated interactive observation, in-depth-interviews with staff, from patientsâ€™ medical records, and by making notes in a logbook. Data were analyzed via grounded theory and compared to the literature on staff-family conflict in general.
