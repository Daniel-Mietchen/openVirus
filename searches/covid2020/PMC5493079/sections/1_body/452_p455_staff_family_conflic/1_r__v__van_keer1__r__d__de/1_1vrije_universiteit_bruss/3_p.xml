 <bold>Results:</bold> It is known that, in general, physicians identify a situation less often as conflict-loaded than relatives, suggesting the presence of hidden conflicts during critical care [1-2]. However, in our studied multi-ethnic ICU conflicts were found to be explicitly recognized by both relatives as well as healthcare professionals, and to be very visible and auditable on the ward. Moreover where in general relative-staff conflict tend to be centered around crisis moments (end-of-life decision making, patients’ death) [3], we found that in a multi-ethnic ICU conflicts tend to be present during various care phases (curative phase, end-of-life decision making, non-curative phase, patients’ death) and concern a broad spectrum of care aspects ( e.g. bedside care activities, seeking a second opinion), easily assaulting the core of actors’ identity. Consequently, end-of-life decisions, often a difficult assignment in ICUs, might be even more problematical in a multi-ethnic context than in general, as tensions in the pre-end of life decision making phase might worsen conflicts in the end-of-life decision making phase.
