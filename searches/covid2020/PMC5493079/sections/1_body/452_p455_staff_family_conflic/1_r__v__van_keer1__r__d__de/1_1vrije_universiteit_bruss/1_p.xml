 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Conflicts between healthcare professionals and patients’ relatives are rather common in the intensive care unit (ICU). As a result of societies’ increased ethnic diversity these conflicts more often involve actors with a different ethno-cultural background. However few is known about the specific nature of staff-family conflicts in a multi-ethnic ICU environment. In this study, we give an overview of some characteristics of conflicts between family members from ethnic-minority groups and staff members and compare them to characteristics of staff-family conflict in general.
