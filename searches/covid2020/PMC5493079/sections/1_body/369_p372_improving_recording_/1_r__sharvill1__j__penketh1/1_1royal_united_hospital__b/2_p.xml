<p id="Par3414">Sedation is routine in UK emergency departments (EDs); to maintain and improve our quality of care, and compare local practice with national and international standards, a standardised and sensitive tool is needed to detect and report adverse events (AE). The World SIVA International Sedation Taskforce tool [1] incorporates physiological thresholds, clinical interventions, and overall outcome to grade AE as minimal to sentinel. We incorporated this tool into our sedation documentation, and report its effect on the detection and documentation of AEs.</p>
