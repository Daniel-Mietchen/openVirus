<p id="Par3416">All notes from patients undergoing sedation in our ED between 1/1/14 and 30/4/14 were retrospectively reviewed for documentation of AE, as well as evidence of adverse events where not formally recorded. After implementation of a new sedation proforma incorporating the SIVA tool [1], the data collection process was repeated retrospectively between 1/10/14 and 30/1/15.</p>
