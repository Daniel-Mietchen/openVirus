 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this study, ARDS affects mainly young patients with respiratory history. The management is very heavy especially in a country like ours because of the lack of materials and particularly monitoring. The mortality rate from ARDS remains high. Currently the development of the prone technique and body extra support may improve the ARDS mortality rate.
