<p id="Par3433">Sedation in ICU using sevoflurane via Anaconda enables desirable sedation level with numerous advantages over propofol/midazolam based sedation. In patient with severe ARDS inhaled nitric oxide (NO) improves oxygenation and reduces right heart afterload. Both therapies are simultaneously used in our ICU with ARDS patients and patients with right heart failure being ventilated for various reasons. Since sevoflurane can interact with certain gas monitoring (eg. Quark rmr indirect calorimetry) we examined potential gas readings interaction with NO.</p>
