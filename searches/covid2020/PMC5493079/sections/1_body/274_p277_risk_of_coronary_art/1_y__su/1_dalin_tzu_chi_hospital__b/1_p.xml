 <bold>Introduction:</bold> It is known that the risk of hemorrhage in patients with chronic liver disease is higher compared with general population. However, the evidences between chronic liver disease and coronary artery disease are inconclusive. We investigated the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic liver disease in Taiwan to evaluate if there is a higher risk compared to the general population.
