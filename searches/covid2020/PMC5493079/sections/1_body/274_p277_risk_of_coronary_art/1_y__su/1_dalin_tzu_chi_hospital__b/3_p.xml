 <bold>Results:</bold> We identified 28,511 patients with chronic liver disease and 728,285 patients without. After controlling for age, gender, urbanization level, socioeconomic status, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, malignancies, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, smoking, obesity, peripheral artery disease and Charlson Comorbidity Index score, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.74 (95 % confidence interval, 0.65¡X0.84) in patients with chronic liver disease. In subgroup analyses of cirrhotic patients with severe complications, the hazard ratio of coronary artery disease is much lower compared with general population, but the result is not statistically significant. (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95 % confidence interval, 0.04¡X2.14)
