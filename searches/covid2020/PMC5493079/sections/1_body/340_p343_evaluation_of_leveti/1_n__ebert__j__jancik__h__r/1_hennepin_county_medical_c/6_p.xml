<p id="Par3112">Evaluation of 26 patients resulted in a median LEV trough of 9.7mcg/mL (IQR 6.75-18.8) with only 19.2 % of patients within trough goal (57.6 % below goal, 23.1 % above goal). A subset of 15 patients had two consecutive LEV levels, which allowed for pharmacokinetic evaluation, resulting in median maximum concentration (Cmax) = 32.2mcg/mL, minimum concentration (Cmin) = 8.1mcg/mL, volume of distribution = 28.5 L, and half-life = 7.4 hours. The most common maintenance dose was 1 g twice daily (57.6 % of patients), followed by 1.5 g twice daily (23.1 %). Median duration of LEV therapy was 7 days. Seizures occurred in 7 patients during admission (26.9 %), with the majority of seizures occurring in the first 24 hours of admission. Median ICU and hospital LOS were 11 and 15 days, respectively, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 11.5 %.</p>
