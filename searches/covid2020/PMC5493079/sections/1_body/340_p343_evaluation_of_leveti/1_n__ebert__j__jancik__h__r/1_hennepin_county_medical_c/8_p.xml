<p id="Par3114">The majority of LEV trough levels were subtherapeutic during the early post-TBI period despite more aggressive initial dosing compared to previous studies. Linear regression suggests that the optimal dose of LEV for patients with normal renal function is 1.5 g every 8 hours. Further research is necessary to determine the impact of augmented renal clearance on LEV levels in patients with severe TBI.</p>
