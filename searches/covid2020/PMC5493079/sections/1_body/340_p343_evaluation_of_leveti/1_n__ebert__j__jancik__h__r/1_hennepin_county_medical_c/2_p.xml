<p id="Par3108">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may affect the pharmacokinetics of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) leading to the potential for ineffective post-traumatic seizure (PTS) prophylaxis. Levetiracetam (LEV) is increasingly utilized for the prophylaxis of PTS. Recent studies suggest that neurocritical care patients may require higher LEV doses to achieve therapeutic trough levels of 12-20mcg/mL [1,2]. The aim of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of LEV in the early (less than or equal to 7Â days after injury) post-TBI period and evaluate the incidence of seizures.</p>
