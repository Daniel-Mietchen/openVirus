 <bold>Introductions:</bold> We have previously demonstrated that there is an inverse relationship between pre-operative levels of endotoxin core antibodies (EndoCAb) and the development of complications following cardiac surgery[1,2]. It is not known whether this relationship is due to a specific protective effect against specific antigens or if it is a reflection of a generalised hypoimmunity. During the peri-operative period patients are at risk of exposure to endotoxin and staphylococcus with an incidence of surgical site infection of approximately 1-3Â %.
