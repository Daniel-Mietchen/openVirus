 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> An inverse relationship is observed as previously between pre-operative EndoCAb levels and outcome. A similar relationship can be seen also between the anti-staphylococcal antibody levels and outcome with a more pronounced infective component. The absence of a relationship between the varicella antibody levels may imply from this study that low pre-operative immunity relating to post-operative morbidity is specific to the peri-operative threat.
