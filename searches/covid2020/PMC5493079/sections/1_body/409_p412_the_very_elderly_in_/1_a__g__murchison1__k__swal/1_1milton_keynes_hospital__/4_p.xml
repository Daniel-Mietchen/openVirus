<p id="Par3683">Medical patients had the highest acuity scores and highest mortality at all end-points (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig102" ref-type="fig">102</xref>). High APACHE III scores (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig103" ref-type="fig">103</xref>) and increasing numbers of organs supported correlated with shorter time from ICU admission to death (p &lt; 0.0001 in both cases). Of those who required support of 4-5 organs (8 patients), none survived their hospital admission.
