 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Almost half of patients aged over 85 admitted to ICU died before discharge from hospital, but a large proportion of patients who survived 6 months were still alive at two years. High APACHE III scores and organ support were associated with higher mortality. These results suggest that intensive care is of benefit to selected patients aged over 85, and that acuity of illness is a useful indicator of long-term survival.
