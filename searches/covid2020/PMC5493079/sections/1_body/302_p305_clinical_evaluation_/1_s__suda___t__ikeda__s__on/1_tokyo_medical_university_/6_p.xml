The SOFA scores of the FP-group and PP-group were 10}3 (10) and 14}3 (14), respectively; the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). APACHE2 scores of the FP-group and PP-group were 34}7 (35) and 40}8 (44), respectively; however, there was no significant difference between the groups. Procalcitonin levels of the FP-group and PP-group were 9}13 (6) and 22}26 (15), respectively; again there was no significant difference between the groups. IL-6 levels of the FP-group and PP-group were 1096}2851 (98.8) and 19,475}24,603 (11,305), respectively; the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). The EAA level of the FF-group was 0.41}0.16 (0.46), whereas the PP-group was 0.54}0.26 (0.49); however, there was no significant difference in EAA levels between the groups.</p>
