<p id="Par2731">Eighteen patients who were admitted to the ICU after resuscitation in the general medicine ward were studied. Patients were classified as gfair prognosis h (FP-group: 12 persons) if the patient survived more than 28 days or gpoor prognosis h (PP-group: 6 persons) if the patient died within 28 days. Blood samples were drawn for measuring blood chemistry and sepsis-related biomarkers (procalcitonin, presepsin, endotoxin activity assay) immediately after ICU admission. Statistical analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi square test or Fisher’s test. A value of p &lt; 0.05 indicated statistical significance.</p>
