 <bold>Results:</bold> There were no A. baumannii bacteria isolated from the hospital environment or soil, although the bacterium was detected around the lip of one patient. Also, a total of 42 A. baumannii clinical strains were isolated from the lower respiratory tract (n = 20), blood (n = 6), urine (n = 8), and wound catheters and nasal swabs (n = 8). 65 % of the isolated species were classified as class 2 integrons. The strains were 100 % resistant to piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cotrimoxazole, cefepime, ceropenem, and cefotaxime. However, all of the strains were sensitive to polymyxin B
