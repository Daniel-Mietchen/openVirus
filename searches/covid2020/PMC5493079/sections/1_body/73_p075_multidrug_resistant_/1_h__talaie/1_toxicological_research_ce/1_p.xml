 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Here, we determined whether the Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) class 2 integron is in the soil around our hospital, and if the soil is the cause for increasing numbers of A. baumannii infections in our intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A. baumannii has emerged globally as a significant pathogen in hospitals. It is also present in soil and water. In a previous study, we discovered that the A. baumannii class 2 integron occurred most frequently.
