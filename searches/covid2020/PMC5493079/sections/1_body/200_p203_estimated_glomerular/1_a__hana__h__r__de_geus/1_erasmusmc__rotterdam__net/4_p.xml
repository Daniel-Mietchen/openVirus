 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In current clinical practice mathematical equations are used to estimate GFR even in critically ill patients. Apparently, there is a shift from MDRD- toward CKD-EPI-SCr-equation. However, when applied in the critically ill both formulae provide completely incomparable values (data to be published). Therefore it is highly debatable if CKD-EPI-Scr eGFR will be a better estimate in comparison to MDRD-eGFR. Recent literature suggests that the only method that approximates Inulin-based-GFR during critical illness is a measured GFR, which we support to become clinical practice in all ICUâ€™s.
