 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidneys. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of serum creatinine (SCr) per time unit and is an important measure to approximate “true” GFR. CrCl can be estimated either by population based mathematical equations or it can be measured using serum and urine creatinine concentration after collection of urine over a certain period of time. Deterioration of CrCl/GFR identifies patients with acute kidney injury and is important for appropriate drug dosing. In our ICU practice the MDRD-eGFR equation is standard of care for a “reliable” estimation of GFR. Recently, the CKD-EPI-SCr equation was introduced as a more accurate measure especially in patients with higher GFRs. However, in critical ill patients there is no steady state of SCr, which is a prerequisite in order to estimate GFR irrespective of the mathematical formula used. We regularly treat patients with demonstrably highly impaired kidney function in spite of “normal” estimated GFR leading to toxic levels of renally cleared drugs. We investigated the actual practice of GFR approximation in Dutch ICUs.
