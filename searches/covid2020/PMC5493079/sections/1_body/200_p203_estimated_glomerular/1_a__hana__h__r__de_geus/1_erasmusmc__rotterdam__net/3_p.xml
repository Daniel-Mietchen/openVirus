 <bold>Results:</bold> In June 2015 35 hospitals in the Netherlands (27 hospitals in southern Holland and 8 academic hospitals) were approached and the on-call intensive care doctor and clinical chemist were queried. At the moment of our query 15 hospitals used the CKD-EPI-SCr equation in order to estimate GFR, 20 hospitals used MDRD-equation with 5 planning to soon introduce CKD-EPI-SCr equation. In all intensive care units, ours included, eGFR on admission was used to define patient’s GFR and determine drug dosing. Intensive care doctors were conscious that eGFR might overestimate their patient’s “true” GFR. Protocols for drug level analysis (i.e. Vancomycine) exist. However, standardized measurements of patients CrCl were not performed in none of the ICU’s.
