 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Procalcitonin (PCT) has been proposed as a helpful tool to guide treatment with antibiotics and to improve antibiotics stewardship. [1,2,3] However the cut off for the PCT level has not been agreed as different studies have suggested different thresholds to predict the need for antibiotics, these cut off points ranged from 0.25 ng/mL – 1 ng/mL. In our hospital the reference range is set at 0.5 ng/mL. This study aimed at identifying the best PCT level to rule out sepsis.
