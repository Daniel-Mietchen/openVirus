 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Despite rigorous efforts to maintain normal PO4-levels via PO4-infusion, severe hypophosphatemia occured in 66Â % of all pts. In contrast, a PO4-containing dialysis fluid ensured normal PO4-levels in most pts. and significantly reduced the risk of severe hypoPO4. There was a trend towards reduced length of mech. ventilat. and ICU stay. Thus, a PO4-containg dialysate can be recommended to increase safety of CRRT in ICU patients.
