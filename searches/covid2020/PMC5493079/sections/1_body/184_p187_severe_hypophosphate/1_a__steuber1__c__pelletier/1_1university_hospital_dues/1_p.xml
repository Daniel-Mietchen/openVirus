 <bold>Introductions:</bold> CRRT with regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) provides long filter running times and effective dialysis doses. Thus, the risk of hypophosphatemia (hypoPO4) is high and PO4 substitution is required. We investigated whether separate infusion of PO4 or a PO4-containing dialysis fluid is more effective to avoid severe hypoPO4.
