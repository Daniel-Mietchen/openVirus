 <bold>Results:</bold> We analyzed 325 patients with a median age of 55 (36-71) years and SAPS II of 43 (29-58) value points. No differences in mortality in ICU were found when comparing the time of admission (35 % on weekends vs 31 % on weekdays, p = ns) nor the time of entry (nocturnal 35 % vs diurnal 31 % , p = ns). The discharge day was associated with higher hospital mortality (57 % in the weekend vs. 14 % on weekdays, p = 0.000).Factors associated with hospital mortality by uni variate analisys were: age less than 50 years (43 % vs 17 %; p = 0.000); SAPS II higher than 35 points (36 % vs 21; p = 0.017), weekend discharge from ICU (57 % vs 14 %, p = 0.000), COPD (46 % vs 26 %, p = 0,031), cardiovascular comorbidity (46 % vs 25 %, p=,005) , and tracheostomised patients (42 % vs 25 %, p = 0,019).
