 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our maternity staff were initially aware of SIRS and Sepsis and simple interventions required to diagnose and treat patients, however their baseline knowledge of details in diagnosis and management was poor. We demonstrated that simple interventions such as 1:1 teaching, a poster and readily available leaflet can dramatically improve knowledge.
