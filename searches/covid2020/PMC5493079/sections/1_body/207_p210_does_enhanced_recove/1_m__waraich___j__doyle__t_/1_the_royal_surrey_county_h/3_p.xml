 <bold>Results:</bold> Our single centre cohort included 459 patients, of which 127 were in the group before the introduction of ERAS (pre ERAS) and 332 were post introduction group (post ERAS). The overall incidence of AKI was 10.24 % in the pre ERAS group and 9.04 % in the post ERAS group which was not statistically different. At day 1 the incidence of AKI was 3.94 % in the pre ERAS group and 1.52 % in the post ERAS group (p-value 0.22). At day 3 it was 8.2 % in the pre group and 6.48 % in the post group (p-value 0.67). Analysis showed there was no statistical difference between the incidence of AKI in the pre and post ERAS groups at day 1,3,7 or 30.
