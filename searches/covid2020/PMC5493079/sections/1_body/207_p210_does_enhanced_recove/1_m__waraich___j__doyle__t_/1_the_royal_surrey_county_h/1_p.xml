 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Gynae-oncological surgery involves a patient population that is elderly, undergoing intra-abdominal surgery sometimes with tumour extension to the ureters; long anaesthetic and surgical times with extensive blood loss. All of these factors have been highlighted in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) as factors for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) [1]. The incidence of AKI in the gynaecological population is thought to be about 13Â % [2]. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways incorporate the use of goal directed fluid therapy with cardiac output monitoring perioperatively. Our study aim was to look at the incidence of AKI before and after the introduction of an ERAS pathway in our centre.
