 <bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively looked at patients undergoing major gynae-oncological surgery before and after the introduction of an ERAS pathway. There was no patient exclusion in our cohort. We used the KDIGO definition of AKI using the patientâ€™s preoperative serum creatinine as baseline. Serum creatinine on admission to the critical care unit was taken as day 1. Data was collected for day 1, 3, 7 and 30. The main outcome of the study was the incidence of AKI pre and post ERAS introduction. Contingency analysis using Yates Chi-squared was performed.
