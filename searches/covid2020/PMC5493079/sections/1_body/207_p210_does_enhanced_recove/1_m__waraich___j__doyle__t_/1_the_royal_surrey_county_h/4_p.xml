 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The incidence of AKI in our cohort of patients was lower than cited at about 10Â %. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of AKI after the introduction of an ERAS pathway. Thus, we observed no reduction in the incidence of AKI with the introduction of an ERAS pathway.
