 <bold>Methods:</bold> A model with a recoiling elastic lung and expansive chest wall complex was built (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig70" ref-type="fig">70</xref>). Lung elastance could be varied between 46, 24, and 17 cmH2O/L. In volume control, PEEP was increased from 0 to 4, 8, and 12 cmH2O, while airway and pleural pressure was measured and deltaEELV obtained by spirometry.
