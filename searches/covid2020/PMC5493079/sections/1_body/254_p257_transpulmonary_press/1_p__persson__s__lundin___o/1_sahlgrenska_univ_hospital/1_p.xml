 <bold>Introduction:</bold> We have shown in pigs and ARDS patients that lung elastance can be determined without esophageal pressure as the change in PEEP divided by the change in end-expiratory lung volume, deltaPEEP/deltaEELV [1,2]. The hypothesis is that this is an effect of contra-directional forces of the expanding rib cage and recoil of the lung that creates negative pleural pressure, which persists also at an increased PEEP/EELV. Esophageal pressure, used as a surrogate for pleural pressure (PPL) is unreliable for determining absolute end-expiratory esophageal pressure, because of extra-pleural effects on measurements. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of an expanding rib cage on absolute pleural pressure changes during PEEP steps in a respiratory system model.
