 <bold>Results:</bold> When PEEP was increased endexpiratory pleural pressure increased during the first expiration, but then declined back to baseline, while end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (PTPEE) increased until it equaled the change in end-expiratory airway pressure (deltaPEEP = deltaPTPEE) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig71" ref-type="fig">71</xref>). There was an good correlation between transpulmonary pressure at all lung volume levels derived from PAW-PPL (pleural pressure) and transpulmonary pressure derived from lung elastance calculated as deltaPEEP/deltaEELV, r2 = 0.99, y = 1.01x.
