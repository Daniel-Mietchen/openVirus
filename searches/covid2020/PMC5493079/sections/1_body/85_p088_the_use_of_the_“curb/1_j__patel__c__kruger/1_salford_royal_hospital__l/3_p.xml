 <bold>Methods:</bold> 83 case notes of patients who presented with CAP were retrospectively reviewed between March-May 2014. Based on the data 3 key interventions were implemented. A teaching session regarding the calculation and practical application of the CURB-65 score was delivered to all emergency room clinicians. A CURB-65 pro forma was created and implemented for use in the electronic patient record system used at the hospital. Alongside this a pre-designed set of electronic antibiotic prescription sets were created and incorporated into the electronic prescribing system in use at the audit site. These accountated for allergies, patient weight and renal/hepatic function. A further 50 case notes of patients presenting with a CAP were then retrospectively reviewed during December 2014-Jan 2015 in order to assess the impact of the above interventions.
