 <bold>Introduction:</bold> The “CURB-65 score” is a convenient, well validated tool to assess disease severity and aid in the clinical management of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) [1]. Recent literature however demonstrates that its use is variable and often inaccurate. Failure to use this tool may lead to over or under treatment and may result in inappropriate patient admission thereby increasing healthcare costs [2].
