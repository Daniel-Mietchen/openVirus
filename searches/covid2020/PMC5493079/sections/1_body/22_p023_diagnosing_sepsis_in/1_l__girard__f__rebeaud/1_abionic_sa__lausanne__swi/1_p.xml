 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Current biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis are neither sufficiently specific nor sensitive. Moreover, comprehensive diagnosis is today delayed by the long time-to-result required for the quantitative measurement of blood proteins in centralized laboratories. Therefore, the need to combine a rapid, near-patient diagnostic platform with the accurate measurement of proteins in complex matrices is the key to improve sepsis patient outcome. We developed nanofluidic biosensors that accelerate molecular interaction and thereby reduces incubation time from hours to minutes. Biosensors are analyzed in the abioSCOPE, a miniaturized automated fluorescence microscope. Fluorescent antibodies specific for the tested protein are mixed with 50 μ l of blood collected at the patient’s fingertip. Complexes of detecting antibodies and analytes are captured on the sensing area of the biosensors and, upon excitation, emit a signal proportional to the concentration of the analyte. As a proof-of-concept, we prepared biosensors for the quantification of pancreatic stone protein (PSP/reg), a promising biomarker that showed its superior ability to predict the outcome of patients affected by sepsis in several clinical studies [1].
