 <bold>Results:</bold> High analytical specificity was showed in a competitive inhibition study. Analytical sensitivity of the test is inferior to the mean PSP/reg value of a cohort of healthy individuals and the test is linear up to 1000Â ng/ml of PSP/reg, thereby meeting clinical requirements. In a small-size comparison study, a good agreement was observed for PSP/reg values measured in microtiter ELISA and in the abioSCOPE.
