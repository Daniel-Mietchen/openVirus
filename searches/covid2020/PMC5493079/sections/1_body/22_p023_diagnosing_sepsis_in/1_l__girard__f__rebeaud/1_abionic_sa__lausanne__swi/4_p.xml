 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The analytical performances of the PSP/reg test in nanofluidic biosensors highlight that rapid and accurate quantitative measurement of low abundance proteins can be achieved at no quality costs. More data is however needed to better evaluate the diagnostic performance of PSP/reg in various settings. Quantification of PSP/reg in 5 minutes in the abioSCOPE, together with the evaluation of other specific clinical signs performed at the bedside, will hopefully improve the decision-making process of patient with suspected sepsis and improve patient’s management in various clinical scenarios.
