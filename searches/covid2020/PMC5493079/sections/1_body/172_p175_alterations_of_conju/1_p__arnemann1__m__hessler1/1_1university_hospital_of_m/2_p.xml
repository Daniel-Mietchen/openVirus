 <bold>Methods:</bold> After approval by the local veterinary authorities, 10 female sheep were anaesthetized. After Baseline measurements 3x 10 ml blood per kg body weight were withdrawn to establish haemorrhagic Shock. Sheep were randomized to receive either 0,9 % NaCl (Saline group, n = 5) or Volulyte® (HES group, n = 5) for Resuscitation until Baseline values of mean arterial pressure (MAP) were reached again. At Baseline, Shock and after Resuscitation haemodynamic variables and 5 videos of conjunctival microcirculation were recorded (CytoCam®, Braedius, Huizen, The Netherlands). The perfused vessel density (PVD) and microvascular flow index (MFI) were calculated using a dedicated software (AVA Software v3.2, MicroVisionMedical, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All values are presented as Median [IQR]. Mann-Whitney-U-Test was used for comparisons between groups. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
