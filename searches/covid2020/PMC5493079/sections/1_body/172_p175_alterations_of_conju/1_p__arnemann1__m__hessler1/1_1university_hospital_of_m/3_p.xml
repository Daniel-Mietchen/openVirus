 <bold>Results:</bold> MAP decreased in both groups from Baseline to Shock and increased after Resuscitation (Saline: from 89 mmHg [82;92] to 34 mmHg [32;46] to 72 mmHg [72;78]; HES: from 86 mmHg [71;97] to 43 mmHg [36;46] to 83 mmHg [67;92]; non-significant (ns) between groups). In the Saline group 4980 ml [3312;5700] and in the HES group 610 ml [489;615] of the respective fluid was needed (p = 0.009). In both groups, PVD decreased from Baseline to Shock (Saline: from 100 % to 83 % of Baseline value [49;86]; HES: from 100 % to 74 % [61;80]; ns between groups). While PVD increased after Resuscitation in the HES group to 125 % [120;147] it decreased in the Saline group to 64 % [62;79] (p = 0.009). MFI decreased from Baseline to Shock in both groups (Saline: from 3.1 [2.5;3.3] to 2.0 [1.6;2.3]; HES: from 2.9 [2.9;3.1] to 2.5 [2.3;2.7]; ns between groups). After Resuscitation MFI increased significantly higher in the HES (3.4 [3.2;3.5]) than in the Saline (2.7 [2.4;2.8]) group (p = 0.012).
