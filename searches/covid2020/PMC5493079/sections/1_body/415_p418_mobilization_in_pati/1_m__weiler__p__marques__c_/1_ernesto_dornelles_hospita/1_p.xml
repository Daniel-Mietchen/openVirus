 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Recent studies show that ICU survivors who needed mechanical ventilation often presents with neuromuscular weakness and functional impairment. ICU Acquired Weakness may develop even in critical patients who are immobilized for only a few days despite receiving supportive care and physiotherapy. Such weakness contributes for poor outcome. Early mobilization may enhance functional recovery, reduce days in mechanical ventilation, shorten ICU and hospital length of stay, decrease the incidence of delirium and improve survival. A great part of ICU patients are on vasoactive drug therapy, but there are few data in literature about the safety of mobilization in this group. Therefore our study aimed to prove that early mobilization even of patients using low dose of vasoactive drugs is safe and feasible.
