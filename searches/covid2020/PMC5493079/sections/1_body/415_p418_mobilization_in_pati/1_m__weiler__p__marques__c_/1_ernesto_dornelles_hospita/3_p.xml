 <bold>Results:</bold> 154 patients were followed from November 3, 2015 to November 20, 2015. 50.6% of patients were men. Mean age was 71.1 in vasoactive group and 73.4 in control group. Mean SAPS 3 score was 73.6 in vasoactive group and 62.7 in control group (p &lt; 0.05). The types of vasoactive drugs were 53.5% norepinephrine, 45.1% nitroprusside and 1.4% nitroglycerine. We removed from bed and putted on the seating position 34.7% of patients in the vasoactive group and 57.3% in the other group. There weren’t complications statistically significant. During the exercises there were changes on MAP, but with no major event associated, though increase in dose of vasoactive drug (p &gt; 0.05). The only statistically significant difference between the two groups was increase in MAP in the vasoactive group immediately after mobilization (from mean MAP of 84.02 to 87.0). The mean dosage in mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine was 0.0117, nitroprusside 0.098 and nitroglycerin 0.278.
