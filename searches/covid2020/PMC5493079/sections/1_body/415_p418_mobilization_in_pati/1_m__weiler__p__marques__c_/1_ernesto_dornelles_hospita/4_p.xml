 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study showed that mobilization of patients on low dose of vasoactive drugs therapy may be possible and safe, with little complications and no major changes in MAP. These data are very important to encourage early mobilization of patients in ICU and to ameliorate their outcomes.
