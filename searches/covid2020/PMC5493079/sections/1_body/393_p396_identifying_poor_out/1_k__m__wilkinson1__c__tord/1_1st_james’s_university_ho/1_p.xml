 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Our objective was to identify factors associated with high mortality on admission to a mixed ICU in a resource-constrained environment, and to examine the impact of high-risk admissions. Currently we admit around 1200 patients per year to our mixed general university hospital ICU. Our predicted mortality is higher than the national average (ICNARC).
