 <bold>Methods:</bold> This was a retrospective review of 6570 consecutive admissions from 2009-14. We analysed our existing ICNARC dataset, together with referring specialty, lead time bias and CPR prior to admission. Logistic regression was used to describe predicted hospital mortality using age, Apache II score, referring specialty and pre-admission CPR. The subset admitted post-CPR were further analysed. These models were then fit-tested using ROC curves. Cost of ICU stay was estimated using mean duration of stay and our current mean ICU cost.
