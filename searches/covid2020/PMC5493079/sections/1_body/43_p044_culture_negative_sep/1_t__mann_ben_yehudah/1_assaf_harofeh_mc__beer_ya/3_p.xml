 <bold>Results:</bold> During the study period, 300 patients had at least one negative blood culture. 132 had all cultures negative, 76 had positive BCs, and 92 had other positive cultures. The BC positive group resembled the negative group in all baseline characteristics. There was a significant difference in the admission scores, with higher SOFA and APACHE2 scores of the BC positive group. SOFA score was higher for the positive group throughout the ICU stay. There was no difference in SIRS in both groups. However, there was more shock, need for vasopressors, renal failure, respiratory failure and neurological alterations in the BC positive group. The BC positive group was more frequently started on antibiotics and had more antibiotic days then the negative group. They also had worse outcomes with a higher mortality in the ICU (40 % in the positive vs. 6.8 % in the negative, p &lt; 0.0001) and in the hospital (47.4 % vs. 9.9 % respectively, p &lt; 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis of ICU death predictors, the only independent predictors were APACHE2 &gt; 25 and positive BC group. Disease severity was also worse in non-blood positive culture group when compared with the negative group; scores were higher, there was more end organ dysfunction, antibiotic treatment was longer and Outcomes were worse.
