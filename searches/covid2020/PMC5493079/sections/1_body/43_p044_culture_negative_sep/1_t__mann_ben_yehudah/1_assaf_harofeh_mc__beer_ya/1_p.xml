 <bold>Introduction:</bold> There is paucity of data concerning the group of patients with a clinical syndrome of sepsis, suspected clinical infection and negative cultures regarding disease severity, end organ failure and outcomes. It is also not clear whether patients with only negative blood cultures (BCs) but other positive cultures have a different disease entity than patients who have no growth in all of the cultures taken. Our study attempts to further define true culture negativity and its effect on disease severity and outcomes.
