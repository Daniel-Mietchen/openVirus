<p id="Par3015">Accurate prognostic models, including common intensive care severity scores such as APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II), SAPS II (simplified acute physiology score) and SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment) are of high importance for quality assurance and research in intensive care [1-3]. The aim of our study was to investigate the usefulness of these in predicting mid-term mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and whether the scores are of any extra value compared to a basic model comprising of only age and level of consciousness.</p>
