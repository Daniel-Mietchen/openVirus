<p id="Par3019">Totally 3,218 patients were included (1,238 in the development and 1,980 in the validation cohort). Both APACHE II and SAPS II showed good discrimination (AUC 0.84, AUC 0.85, respectively) but did not outperform the reference model (AUC 0.85; compared to APACHE II, p = 0.133; compared to SAPS II, p = 0.141). SOFA, however, displayed significantly poorer performance compared to the other models (AUC of 0.76). All models showed poor calibration (p &lt; 0.05). Age was found to be a particularly strong predictor of death in patients with GCS 9-12, as the mortality for patients aged &lt;40 was only 8 %, yet being as high as 43 % for patients aged &gt;79.</p>
