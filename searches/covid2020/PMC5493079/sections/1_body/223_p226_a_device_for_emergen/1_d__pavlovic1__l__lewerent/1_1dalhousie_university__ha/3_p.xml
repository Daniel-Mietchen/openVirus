 <bold>Results:</bold> It was shown that, by increasing flow during expiration, the valve would permit to shorten the expiratory time and achieve higher minute volumes (i.e. volumes of 7 L/min of gas or higher), as compared with the ventilation with the similar transtracheal cannula without variable flows (volumes achieved were about 4 L/min). Variable flow would provide shortening of the inspiratory time and efficient expiratory aid, and permit I:E ratios of 1:1, or even the inverse ratio ventilation.
