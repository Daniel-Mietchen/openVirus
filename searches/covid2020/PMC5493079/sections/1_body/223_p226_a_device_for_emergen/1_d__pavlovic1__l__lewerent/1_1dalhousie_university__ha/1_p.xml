 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Here we present an improved theoretical version of a valve for transtracheal ventilation as a bi-directional manual respiratory pump where a combination of low flow during inspiration, by reducing gas supply to the valve, and increased flow during expiration, by increasing gas supply to the valve, permits more effective venturi effect and efficient expiration, with low total gas consumption.
