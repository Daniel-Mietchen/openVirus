 <sup>2</sup>; p &lt; 0.001) with a bias of +260 ± 182 ml/m
 <sup>2</sup> and a percentage error (PE) of 40.6 %. GEDVI-fem-cor was slightly different to GEDVI-jug (811 ± 159 vs. 765 ± 145 ml/m
 <sup>2</sup>; p = 0.025) with a PE of 29.6 % and a bias of 46 ± 117 ml/m
 <sup>2</sup> which was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.001) than the bias for GEDVI-fem-uncor. GEDVI-form was not significantly different from GEDVI-jug (797 ± 162 vs. 765 ± 145 ml/m
 <sup>2</sup>; p = 0.063) with a PE of 26.1 % and a bias of 31 ± 108 ml/m
 <sup>2</sup> which was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.001) than the bias for GEDVI-fem-uncor, but not than the bias for GEDVI-fem-cor (p = 0.557).
