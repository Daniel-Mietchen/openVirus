 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Usually TPTD for measurement of global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) is performed by indicator injection via the jugular or subclavian vein. If this access is not feasible, femoral access can be used. However, several studies demonstrated significant overestimation of GEDVI due to the additional volume of V. cava inferior. One of these studies provided a correction formula (1). As a consequence, one of the manufacturers of commercially available TPTD-devices requires information about the venous catheter position, and correction of GEDVI in case of femoral access can be assumed.
