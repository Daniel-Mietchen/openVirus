 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study confirms that GEDVI derived from uncorrected femoral indicator injection TPTD markedly overestimates GEDVI and also results in inacceptable imprecision. Correction by the PiCCO-device and by the formula recently suggested (1) result in acceptable accuracy and precision of GDVII derived from femoral TPTD. The recently suggested formula provided the lowest bias and PE values.
