 <bold>Methods:</bold> We studied 212 patients [survival (S) group: 146; non-survival (NS) group: 66] in whom PMX-DHP was performed for severe sepsis and septic shock and who were admitted to the ICU. At the same time, blood biochemistry and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured before and after PMX-DHP. A double-lumen catheter was inserted into the patient fs femoral vein, and PMX-DHP was performed using a blood pump to remove endotoxins. The blood access for hemoperfusion consisted of a venous-to-venous system. Nafamostat mesilate was administered as a 40 mg bolus followed by 30-40 mg/hour continuous intravenous infusion as an anticoagulant. Extracorporeal circulation was performed for 2 hours. Results were expressed as mean SD (median). The Mann-Whitney U-test and chi-square test or Fisher fs test were used for statistical analysis.
