Immediately after PMX-DHP, these levels became 48.6 } 69.4 (25.5) in the S-group and 51.9 } 67.5 (19.9) in the NS-group, respectively. The EAA levels before PMX-DHP were 0.50 } 0.22 (0.46) in the S-group and 0.59 } 0.26 (0.59) in the NS-group. Immediately after PMX-DHP, these levels became 0.50 } 0.21 (0.53) in the S-group and 0.53 } 0.27 in the NS-group, respectively.
