 <bold>Results:</bold> Of 4579 patients, 768 (16.8 %), 2624 (57.3 %), 858 (18.7 %), and 329 (7.2 %) patients were classified as underweight, normal BMI, overweight, and obese, respectively. Obese patients had the lowest APACHE II score (8, interquartile range (IQR) 5-12), followed by overweight (10, IQR 7-15), normal BMI (10, IQR 7-16), and underweight (12, IQR 8-16) (p &lt; 0.001). Among these four patient groups, obese patients had the lowest 28-day mortality (6.7 %), followed by overweight (9.6 %), normal BMI (14.7 %), and underweight patient groups (18.5 %) (p &lt; 0.001). Obese patients also had the lowest incidence of SIRS (29.5 %), followed by overweight (34.5 %), normal BMI (35.6 %), and underweight patients (41.1 %) (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, we found that every one unit increasing of BMI associated with lower risk of hospital mortality, adjusted odds ratio = 0.96 (95%CI: 0.94-0.98, p &lt; 0.0001) after adjusted for age, gender, and APACHE II severity score.
