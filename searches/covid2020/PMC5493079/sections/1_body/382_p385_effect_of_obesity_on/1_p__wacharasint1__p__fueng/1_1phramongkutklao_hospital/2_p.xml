 <bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using the THAI-SICU study databases, which recruited 4652 Thai patients who admitted to the surgical intensive care units of nine university-based hospitals in Thailand [2]. All 4579 patients whose body mass index (BMI) and mortality at 28Â days were available, were included in this analysis. The patients were categorized into 4 groups based on their BMI i.e., underweight (BMI &lt;18.5), normal BMI (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and obesity (BMI &gt;30). Primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcome was the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
