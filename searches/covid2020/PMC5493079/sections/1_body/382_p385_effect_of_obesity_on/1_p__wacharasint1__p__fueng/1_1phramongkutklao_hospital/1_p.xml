 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Obesity is one of the major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. While obesity itself is a chronic inflammatory condition, previous studies showed that the obese patient with severe infection was found associated with significantly lower mortality compared to the septic patients with normal BMI [1]. In surgical critically ill patients whether obesity confers a “protective” effect is not clearly defined. We hypothesized that surgical critically ill patients, which their disease pathologies differ from septic medical patients, may also have “protective” effect from obesity.
