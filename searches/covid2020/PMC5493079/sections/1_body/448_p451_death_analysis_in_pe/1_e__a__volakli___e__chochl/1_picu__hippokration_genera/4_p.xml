 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We found that MODS were the main mode of death, following by BD and DL. Pts dying of MODS were more likely to be younger and suffer from co-morbidities. As the majority of pts died from MODS were under inadequate treatment, and the results arrived quite late, we could speculate that timely processing and handling of blood culture results, and better antibiotic coverage could lead to better infection control and less progress to MODS and death.
