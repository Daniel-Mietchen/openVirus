 <bold>Methods:</bold> From April 2014 to Mars 2015, we enrolled critically ill adults requiring more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomized since admission considering availability of SmartCare equipped ventilators (8 Evita XL in our unit: 4 with SmartCare and 4 without). We included patients who tolerated at least 24 hours of pressure support with PEP equal or less than 5 cmH2O and were not ready to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial, they were assigned to be weaned either by SmartCare (SC Group) or by the physician controlled weaning according to local guidelines (PCW Group). Weaning duration, total duration of mechanical ventilation and the success of weaning were the primary endpoints.
