 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Clinicians are routinely faced with the challenges of managing the ventilatory care and weaning process during the clinical course of the illness. Almost 40Â % of mechanical ventilation time is spent on weaning [1] and in the last decade, automatic ventilator control and ventilation modes were designed to help weaning from mechanical ventilation. In many studies automated weaning significantly decreased weaning time in critically ill patients when compared with physician controlled weaning process [2,3]. We conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing automated weaning with a standardized weaning protocol in a multidisciplinary ICU.
