 <bold>Results:</bold> The laryngoscope Flap-Flight upgraded with video-adapter was more efficient in case of difficult intubation. Early tracheostomy was associated with absolutely risk of mediastenitis (28,0 %) (95%CI: 0,14-0,47) in comparison with patients without tracheostomy. Dexmedetomidine was more effectiveness method for sedation which reduced reaction of cardiovascular system from 86 % to 9,5 % (χ =24,44; Ð &lt; 0,01). In control group was 13,5 % of postextubation ARF in comparison with 0.3 % in main group. Postponed extubation was performed from 10 to 72 hours after decreasing inflammatory, larynges edema, and trizm.
