 <bold>Methods:</bold> We included ARDS patients under mechanical ventilation sedated and paralyzed with P/F &lt; 200. An open-lung protocol consisting of a 4-step recruitment maneuver (from 25 to 40 cm of PEEP) and a decremental PEEP titration (to find the best PEEP) was performed after ruling out hypovolemia and severe acidosis. We recorded clinical parameters (mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR)) as well as ejection fraction (EF) using 2D echocardiography, mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) with M-Mode echocardiography, aortic velocity time integral (using pulsed Doppler)(VTI), systolic lateral LV annulus velocity using spectral tissue Doppler imaging (S) and left ventricular longitudinal stress (LVLS) using speckle tracking at baseline, during the recruitment maneuver at 40 cmH2O and 2 minutes after this maneuver at the chosen best PEEP.
