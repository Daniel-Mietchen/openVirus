 <bold>Results:</bold> 9 patients with ARDS (age 55 ± 13y/o) with SAPS 70 ± 15, P/F 130 ± 19, lung compliance 26 ± 8 ml/mmHg, PEEP 9 ± 3 cm H2O, respiratory rate 25 ± 5/mn, MAP 78 ± 12 mmHg, HR 85 ± 12/mn, EF 60 ± 18 %,VTI 22 ± 6 cm, MAPSE 1,3 ± 0,5 cm, S 8,4 ± 4,5 cm/s, were included. During recruitment at a PEEP of 40 cmH2O, HR 90 ± 14/mn and P/F176 ± 85 increased; MAP 62 ± 22 mmHg, MAPSE 1,3 ± 0,5 cm; S 8,4 ± 4,6 cm/s; EF 49 ± 22 %, VTI17 ± 8 cm all decreased. At the best PEEP of 12 ± 5cmH2O, P/F dramatically increase to 242 ± 80 and all hemodynamical and echocardiographic and Doppler parameters returned to the baseline values. LVLS was at -15,6 ± 5,6 % at baseline and dramatically increased to -8,1 ± 5,6 at a PEEP of 40cmH2O and returned to the baseline value of -13,8 ± 5 % immediately after the recruitment maneuver. This left longitudinal strain impairment during the maneuver was more severe at the apex (-19 ± 8 % vs -7 ± 8 %).
