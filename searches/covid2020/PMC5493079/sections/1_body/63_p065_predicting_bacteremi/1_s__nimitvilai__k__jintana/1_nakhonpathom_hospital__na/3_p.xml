 <bold>Results:</bold> There were 106 patients. The mean [SD] age was 44 [17] years and 93 % were female. Twenty-two patients (20.8 %) had diabetes melliutus, while 9 (8.5 %) and 4 (3.7 %) had stone and structural abnormality of urinary system, respectively. Bacteremia was found in 16 patients (15 %). [i]E.coli[/i] was the most common organism (13 cases), followed by MSSA (2 cases) and [i]Proteus mirabilis[/i] (1 case). Surprisingly, 6 of 13 isolates (46.2 %) of [i]E.coli[/i] were ESBL producer. Patients who had bacteremia were more likely to have older age (mean [SD] age, 54.0 [12.6] vs 42.3 [16.9] years, p 0.004), diabetes mellitus (40 % vs 16 %, p 0.04), chill (100 % vs 61 %, p 0.01), higher body temperature (mean [SD] temperature, 101.3 [33.6] vs 100.0 [34.0] F, p 0.04), BUN/Cr ratio [&gt;=] 16 (67 % vs 41 %, p 0.07) and CRP [&gt;=] 20 mg/L (92 % vs 61 %, p 0.05). Multivariate analysis of factors with p &lt; 0.1 in univariate analysis showed that BUN/Cr ratio [&gt;=] 16 (OR 4.5, 95%CI 1.1-18.7, p 0.04) and CRP [&gt;=] 20 mg/L (OR 10.8, 95%CI 1.3-93.4, p 0.03) were associated with bacteremia.
