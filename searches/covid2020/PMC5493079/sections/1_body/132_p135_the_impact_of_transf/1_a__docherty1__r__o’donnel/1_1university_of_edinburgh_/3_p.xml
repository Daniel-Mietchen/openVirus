 <bold>Results:</bold> We identified 41 trials of which 11 trials enrolling cardiovascular patients (n = 3033) were included for meta-analysis (restrictive n = 1514 patients; liberal n = 1519). There was no association between transfusion thresholds and 30 day mortality RR 1.10 (95 % CI 0.88-1.50, P = 0.30, I2 = 14 %). There was an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients in the restrictive transfusion threshold (9 trials; RR 1.71, 95 % CI 1.11-2.65, P = 0.01, I2 = 0 %) (Fig.
