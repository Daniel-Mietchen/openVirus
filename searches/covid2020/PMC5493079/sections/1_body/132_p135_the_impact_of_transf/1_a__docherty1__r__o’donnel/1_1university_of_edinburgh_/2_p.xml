 <bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a systematic review with meta-analyses of in-hospital randomised controlled trials that evaluated a restrictive vs liberal transfusion threshold and that included patients with cardiovascular disease. A comprehensive search of databases (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase) was performed on 02/11/2015. Data extraction was completed in duplicate. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane methodology. Mantel-Haenzel random effects models were used with relative risk ratios (95Â % CI). Outcome measures were thirty-day mortality, and cardiovascular events.
