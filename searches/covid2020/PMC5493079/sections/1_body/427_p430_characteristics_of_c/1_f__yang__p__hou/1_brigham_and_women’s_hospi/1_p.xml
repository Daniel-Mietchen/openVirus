 <bold>Introduction:</bold> Patients admitted through the emergency department (ED) to intensive care units (ICU) represent a unique population with varying etiologies of illness, for which existing descriptive analysis of severity and early prognosis of disease is lacking. Our study compares several ICU illness severity scores (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)II, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score) within this cohort of patients during their early ED and ICU course to describe illness progression.
