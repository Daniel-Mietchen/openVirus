 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Illness scores (SOFA, APACHEII, and SAPSII) significantly increased at 24 hours after ICU admission compared to ED arrival. While a preliminary investigation, our data provides insight on expected progression of illness for ICU-bound patients admitted from the ED. Further work is needed in elucidating prognostic indicators and patient-care factors.
