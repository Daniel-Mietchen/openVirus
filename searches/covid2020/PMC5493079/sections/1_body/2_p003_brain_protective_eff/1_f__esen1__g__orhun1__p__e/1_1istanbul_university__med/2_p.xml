 <bold>Methods:</bold> Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation perforation(CLP) in rats. The animals were divided into five groups; sham, control, CLP + saline, CLP + immunoglobulin G IgG(250 mg/kg,iv), and CLP + immunoglobulins enriched with immunoglobulin M- IgGAM(250 mg/kg,iv). Blood and brain samples were taken in two sets of experiments after CLP to see the early(24 hrs) and late(10 days) effects of treatment. Total complement activity, complement 3(C3) and soluble complement C5b-9 levels were measured in sera of rats using ELISA-based methods. Cerebral complement content was analyzed by Western Blot. Immune cell infiltration and gliosis were examined by immunohistochemistry using cluster of differentiation 3, CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD19 and glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies. Apoptotic neuronal death was investigated by TUNEL staining and Western Blot-based semi-quantitative evaluation of brain homogenates by bax and bcl-2 antibodies.
