 <bold>Results:</bold> IV IgG and IgGAM administration significantly reduced systemic complement activity but increased serum C3 and soluble C5b-9 levels. Likewise, Western Blot data showed slightly increased C5b-9 expression and significantly reduced C1q expression in brain samples of IgGAM-treated but not IgG-treated septic rats especially in the first day of administration. No cerebral cellular infiltrates were observed in treated and non-treated septic rats. By contrast, IV IgG and IgGAM treatment induced considerable amelioration in glial cell proliferation which was increased in non-treated rats. IgG and IgGAM treated rats exhibited significantly reduced numbers of apoptotic neurons and cerebral expression levels of bax and bcl-2 as compared to non-treated rats.
