 <bold>Results:</bold> Of the 77 enrolled patients, 37 were assigned to the ANP group (median age 72 yrs, male:female 24:13) and 40 to the placebo group (median age 74 yrs, male:female 31:9). ANP infusion did not significantly increase creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular infiltration rate compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C, renal replacement therapy rate (1 of 37 patients in the ANP group vs 3 of 40 patients in the placebo group), length of ICU and hospital stay, or medical costs for 90 days.
