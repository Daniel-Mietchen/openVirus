 <bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a multicenter prospective randomized placebo-controlled study in patients with AKI who underwent cardiovascular surgery including coronary-artery bypass grafting, valve replacement, and thoracic aorta replacement. This trial was conducted at eleven centers in Japan from May 2012 to March 2015. Definition of AKI used in this study was an increase in serum creatinine level &gt; =0.3 mg/dl from preoperative level within 48 h after surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to receive a continuous infusion of low-dose ANP (0.02microg/kg/min) or placebo. The infusion of ANP or placebo continued until the serum creatinine level decreased to preoperative level. The primary endpoints were 1) changes in renal function during 90 days measured by serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C, and creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate, and 2) need for renal replacement therapy during 90 days. The secondary endpoints were 1) length of ICU, 2) length of hospital stay, and 3) medical costs during 90 days.
