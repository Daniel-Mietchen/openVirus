 <bold>Introductions:</bold> Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiovascular surgery is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a potent endogenous natriuretic, diuretic, and vasorelaxant peptide. However, its effectiveness on AKI is uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ANP on renal function and medical costs in patients with AKI undergoing cardiovascular surgery.
