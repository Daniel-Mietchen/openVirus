<p id="Par3187">We developed and implemented a six-month point-of-care simulation programme within the Royal Cornwall Hospital Emergency Department covering critical illness, paediatric, and major trauma presentations. A live clinically trained actor, rather than a high-fidelity mannequin, acted as the patient in suitable weekly simulations. A curriculum map was designed for each session detailing specific curriculum topics covered. Feedback was collected from 12 Emergency Medicine doctors using visual analogue scale questionnaires.</p>
