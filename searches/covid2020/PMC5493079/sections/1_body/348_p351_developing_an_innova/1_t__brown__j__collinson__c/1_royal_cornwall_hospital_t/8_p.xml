<p id="Par3191">Our research suggests that interaction with a live, simulated patient creates a realistic emergency medicine simulation providing the opportunity to develop non-technical skills within the multi-disciplinary team. We appreciate that particular scenarios may not be suitable for this approach. A comprehensive curriculum map in this context is valued by trainees, and improves trainee familiarity with their curriculum. Further work will involve evaluating any clinical/patient outcome improvements from participating in this simulation programme.</p>
