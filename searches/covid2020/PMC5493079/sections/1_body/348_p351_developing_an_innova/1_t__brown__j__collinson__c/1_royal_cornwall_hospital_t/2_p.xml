<p id="Par3185">Simulation training within Emergency Medicine is growing with various peer-reviewed journals promoting simulation as a valuable educational tool [1,2]. High-fidelity mannequins are commonly used but considerable barriers remain, particularly a lack of human interaction. We suggest that a live patient during a point-of-care simulation teaching series could both create more realistic scenarios, and develop non-technical skills between the multi-disciplinary team. In addition, studies have shown that curriculum mapping optimises teaching in medical education and results in improved student satisfaction [3]. Thus, we set out to develop an innovative Emergency Medicine point-of-care simulation programme using live patients with an associated curriculum map.</p>
