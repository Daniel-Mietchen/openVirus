 <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Adherence to international guidelines need to be reinforced at ICU level. Priorities in middle income countries should focus on improving 1) full barrier precautions and 2) using chlorhexidine &gt;0.5Â % for skin preparation. Reduction of device exposure through daily assessment of CL need remains a priority in both settings. Almost all respondents consider measurement of CLABSI key to quality improvement, however less than a quarter actually report their CLABSI rate. Our study was limited by a non-random sample of ICU doctors and nurses.
