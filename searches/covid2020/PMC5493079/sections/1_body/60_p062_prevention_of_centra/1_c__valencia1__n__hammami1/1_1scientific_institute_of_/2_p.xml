 <bold>Methods:</bold> Between June and October 2015, we disseminated an online questionnaire, available in 10 languages, to medical doctors and nurses working in ICUs through national and international ICU societies. We investigated clinical practices related to central line (CL) insertion, maintenance and measurement of CLABSI-related data. Countries were categorized as high, middle, or low income according to World Bank definitions. We computed weighted estimates (% and standard error, SE) for countries providing at least 10 complete responses.
