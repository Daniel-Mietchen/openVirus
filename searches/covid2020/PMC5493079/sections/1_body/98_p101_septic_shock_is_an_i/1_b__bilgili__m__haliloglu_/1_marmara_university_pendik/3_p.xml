 <bold>Results:</bold> One-hundred and two patients were included in the study. The overall incidence of AKI was 77,5 % (n = 79), and that of severe AKI was 34,3 % (n = 35). On univariate analysis, age and septic shock correlated significantly with severe AKI patients (p = 0,042, p = 0,001, respectively). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, septic shock was the only independent risk factor for colistin-induced severe AKI (OR 8,580 [1,868 – 39,417]; p = 0,006).
