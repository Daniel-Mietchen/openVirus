<p id="Par2830">While a new 2015 AHA guideline of cardiopulmonary resuscitation recommends cardiac compression should be performed on the sternal bone at a level of bust point, there is individual difference in the heart position. The ratio of real-time low-oxygenized cerebral blood circulation represented by rSO2 (regional cerebral oxygen saturation) can be non-invasively and quantitatively measured using a near infrared-red spectroscopy (NIRS) sensor placed at the forehead in which higher absorption of near infrared-red ray occurs in low-oxygenized blood. Therefore, rSO2 potentially enables us to monitor the effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The purpose of this study was to validate rSO2 monitoring on effectiveness of chest compression by investigation of relationship between arterial blood pressure and rSO2 in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).</p>
