Male patient number was 14 (88 %), and 81 % patients had witnesses at the time of cardiopulmonary arrest. Two types of coefficient of correlation between arterial pressure and rSO2 showed that the within patients f coefficient of correlation between MAP and rSO2 was 0.20 (95 % CI:-1.8-0.53), but the coefficient of correlation between patients was 0.82 (95 % CI:0.14-0.72).</p>
