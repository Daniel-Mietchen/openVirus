 <bold>Methods:</bold> Aerosol delivery performance was evaluated by characterising the Emitted dose [drug that exits the mouthpiece or T-piece of a nebuliser] and Tracheal dose [drug delivered beyond the trachea]. A 2.0 mL dose of Salbutamol (1 mg/mL) was nebulised as a tracer aerosol using both a VMN (Aerogen Solo, Aerogen, Ireland), and a JN (Cirrus 2, Intersurgical). Both nebulisers were put in-line with the humidifier nebuliser (Aquamist, Intersurgical) system. Two nebuliser positions (distal and proximal to the patient) were assessed for their effect on both emitted and tracheal dose delivery at supplemental gas flow rates of 5 and 11 LPM (n = 3). For tracheal dose the nebuliser was connected to the head model via facemask. The head model was connected to a breathing simulator (BPM 15, Vt 500 mL, I:E 1:1,) and drug collected on an absolute filter (RespirGard II 303, Baxter). The drug was extracted and quantified using UV spectrophotometry. Finally, a paired t-test analysis was carried out to evaluate the different test setups.
