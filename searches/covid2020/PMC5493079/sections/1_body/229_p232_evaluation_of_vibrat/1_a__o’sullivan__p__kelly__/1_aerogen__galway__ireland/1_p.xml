 <bold>Introduction:</bold> This study investigated emitted and tracheal dose delivery for a vibrating mesh nebuliser (VMN) and jet nebuliser (JN) in line with a humidifier nebuliser system with two different nebuliser positions relative to the patient. Selection of nebuliser type can have a significant impact when treating a patient, previous studies have shown that the VMN delivers more aerosol than the conventional JN [1].
