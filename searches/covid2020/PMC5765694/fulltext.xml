Previous studies suggest that the nasopharyngeal microbiome affects disease development. We therefore studied the effect of the nasopharyngeal microbiome on viral load and mucosal cytokine responses, two important factors influencing the pathophysiology of RSV disease. To determine the relation between (i) the microbiome of the upper respiratory tract, (ii) viral load, and (iii) host mucosal inflammation during an RSV infection, nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles of RSV infected infants (&#x0003c;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;months) with different levels of disease severity and age-matched healthy controls were determined by 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing. The viral load was measured using qPCR. Nasopharyngeal CCL5, CXCL10, MMP9, IL6, and CXCL8 levels were determined with ELISA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients associates significantly to total nasopharyngeal microbiota composition. Healthy infants (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;21) and RSV patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;54) display very distinct microbial patterns, primarily characterized by a loss in commensals like <italic>Veillonella</italic> and overrepresentation of opportunistic organisms like <italic>Haemophilus</italic> and <italic>Achromobacter</italic> in RSV-infected individuals. Furthermore, nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles are significantly different based on CXCL8 levels.

The clinical symptoms vary from upper respiratory tract infection to severe bronchiolitis with respiratory insufficiency for which mechanical ventilation is needed. Despite the high disease burden of RSV in young children, no antivirals, vaccines, or other targeted treatments for bronchiolitis have proven to be beneficial yet, and therefore, only supportive care is currently recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Prematurity, young age (&#x0003c;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;months), and the presence of siblings or daycare attendance are important risk factors for severe RSV disease requiring hospitalization and respiratory support, indicating that development of the immune system as well as environmental factors plays a role in the pathogenesis of RSV bronchiolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">To date, it is thought that the host response to the virus contributes most prominently to the key features of bronchiolitis, marked by swelling of the mucosa, secretion of mucus, and eventually obstruction of the smaller airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, high viral load in the lungs and nasopharynx have been found in children with severe infection, suggesting that viral replication also contributes to increased pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. During the inflammatory response induced by the virus, cytokines and chemokines are released and attract circulating leukocytes to the site of infection. As recently reviewed by Russel et al., CXCL-8 and CXL-10 have been associated with immune pathology, whereas CCL-5 in general is associated with a more beneficial immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It seems that a balanced inflammatory response with influx of immune cells is crucial, as indicated by near absence of cytotoxic CD8 cells in fatal cases of RSV bronchiolitis and the presence of massive influx of neutrophils in the lumen of the airways of most severe infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The importance of the inflammatory response in the development of severe disease is further underlined by the association of the level of circulating immune cells and secreted cytokines with disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Respiratory mucosal surfaces are colonized directly after birth with bacteria from the mother, and the composition changes dramatically during the first years of life depending on genetics and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These commensal bacteria release components such as lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans that have been shown to pass the epithelial barrier of the mucosal lining under non-inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This translocation of bacterial products increases during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Induction of the initial innate immune response in epithelial cells and immune cells by RSV and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines should therefore be considered in the presence of these bacterial products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Findings from the MARC-35 bronchiolitis cohort by Mansbach and coworkers, a prospective study of 1016 infants below 1&#x000a0;year of age hospitalized with bronchiolitis, underpin the importance of bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract during viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. They show that depending on infection with RSV and rhinovirus, different compositions of nasopharyngeal microbiota are found, mainly higher levels of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus</italic>/<italic>Moraxella,</italic> respectively. Steenhuijsen Piters and co-workers recently showed that clusters characterized by the dominance of <italic>Haemophilus</italic> (<italic>influenzae</italic>) and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> were positively associated with RSV infection and RSV-related hospitalization, based on nasopharyngeal microbiota clusters that were stratified prior to analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, they reported enhanced expression of host genes linked to inflammation and immune signaling in patients with the two microbiota clusters (<italic>Haemophilus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> dominated), suggesting that interactions between RSV and specific components of the nasopharyngeal microbiota modulate the host immune response, potentially driving clinical disease severity. These findings are further supported by the association of specific metabolic profiles in respiratory samples with severe bronchiolitis, which could be linked to the composition of the microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this study, we investigate the association of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, without prior stratification on microbiota types, to RSV load, nasopharyngeal cytokine responses, and the association with disease severity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>RSV study cohort and baseline characteristics.</title><p id="Par32">We retrospectively selected a cohort of 54 infant patients younger than 6&#x000a0;months of age, who were hospitalized with an RSV infection, and 21 age-matched healthy infants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1A).

Where several previous studies focused on the microbial content involved in bronchiolitis, most notably by Hasegawa and coworkers, our study exclusively focused on RSV-implicated bronchiolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. RSV disease severity is a multifactorial problem, in which the viral load and the inflammatory response are important drivers of disease, although this is mainly true in previously healthy children whose airways are normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. An important question this study tried to answer is whether nasopharyngeal microbiome composition relates to local viral load and exerts an influence on mucosal immune responses. Viral load and mucosal immune responses are thought to directly impact disease severity, and therefore, it is difficult to disentangle these direct and indirect effects of the microbiome on disease outcome. The alpha diversity of the microbiota from patients with an acute RSV infection showed a decrease in species richness but not in diversity compared to healthy infants. This means that the number of different species reduces while there is no difference in the distribution of the numbers of each species. A reduced alpha diversity of the upper respiratory tract has also been shown in a longitudinal cohort study of symptomatic rhinovirus infections in infants (&#x0003c;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and after administration of an intranasal live-attenuated influenza vaccine in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Both studies were performed prospectively and show that lower alpha diversity is caused by viral infection and is not a prerequisite for viral infection. In another observational study, comparing the microbiome during RSV and rhinovirus infections, it was shown that there might be an association with different nasopharyngeal microbiome profiles, although this has not been confirmed by others yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This suggests that the type of alteration of the microbiome might be specific for RSV infection but also could be a more general effect of immune system perturbation. Yet, it is uncertain whether the observed microbiome changes in our study are the cause or effect of RSV infection.</p><p id="Par44">A multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA) could separate healthy controls from RSV-infected infants but could not separate microbiomes based on the level of disease severity. In the study of Steenhuijsen Piters et al., the authors concluded that the microbiota composition might affect the clinical severity, but we were unable to reproduce these findings, perhaps because different RSV severity measures were applied. Nevertheless, a strong and significant overrepresentation of <italic>Haemophilus</italic> was found in RSV-infected children, especially in severe and moderate disease. In a recent study, Rosas-Salazar and coworkers observed a similar increase of <italic>Haemophilus</italic> in infants with acute RSV infection compared to healthy controls and also of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Moraxella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In line with these and our own findings, Hasegawa and coworkers reported that infants with RSV infection and <italic>Haemophilus</italic>-dominant profiles had higher odds of intensive care use than RSV-infected infants with profiles dominated by other bacteria, such as <italic>Moraxella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the MARC-35 bronchiolitis cohort by Mansbach and coworkers, lower levels of <italic>Haemophilus</italic>/<italic>Moraxella</italic> were found in the nasopharynx of RSV-infected infants in comparison to rhinovirus; however, this study had no data on healthy infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although in our studies <italic>Achromobacter</italic> shows a much lower abundance than <italic>Haemophilus,</italic> it appeared to be also dominant in RSV-infected infants. Apart from a few studies describing the association of <italic>Achromobacter xyloxosidans</italic> with pneumonia in newborns and young infants, and chronic infection in cystic fibrosis patients, not much is known about this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Much more in vitro and in vivo evidence is present with regard to increased susceptibility for viral infections and increased inflammatory responses associated with <italic>Haemophilus</italic> colonization and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it is shown that the composition of the microbial colonization in the nasopharynx is associated with a higher RSV load, with <italic>Haemophilus</italic> (<italic>influenzae</italic>) as most prominent candidate contributing to these differences (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2B). Interaction of <italic>Haemophilus</italic> with epithelial cells may lead to the suppression of anti-viral immune pathways allowing increased replication. An alternative explanation would be that RSV facilitates the colonization of <italic>Haemophilus</italic>. However, no evidence for any of the two hypotheses can be found in the current literature. The <italic>Helcococcus</italic> genus<italic>,</italic> another lead based on our reported association with levels of CXCL8 in the NPA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c), is not likely to have a great impact on its niche, as it is very lowly abundant (0.01% on average), and is only represented by three RSV patients, and the association was not observed at the level of OTUs. The increase in IL6 and CXCL-8 responses in RSV patients colonized with <italic>Haemophilus</italic> as found in our study corroborates a recent in vitro study by Gulraiz et al. They showed that release of IL6 and CXCL-8 after RSV infection, but not rhinovirus infection, was synergistically increased in <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> pre-treated human bronchial epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], suggesting that the interaction between <italic>H</italic>. <italic>influenzae</italic>, CXCL8, and RSV may be specific for RSV infections. It should finally be noted that other cytokine responses than the ones studied here might be important for RSV pathogenesis, such as T-helper 1, T-helper 2, and T-regulatory cell type cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Their potential involvement with the nasopharyngeal microbiome during RSV pathogenesis can therefore not be confirmed within the current study.</p><p id="Par45">Interestingly, Steenhuijsen Piters et al. recently reported an enhanced (non-significant) CXCL8 gene expression response, measured in a whole blood transcriptome analysis, that was associated with nasopharyngeal microbiomes that were dominated by <italic>Haemophilus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In our study, we are able to show a significant association between nasopharyngeal CXCL8 levels and RSV infection and even with disease severity. Although presence of <italic>Haemophilus</italic> was related to the levels of CXCL8, we could not confirm a direct relation between the composition of the microbiome and disease severity. A possible explanation could be that although we stratified the patients on severity level, all patients included in our study were hospitalized and therefore severely ill. The differences in disease severity might have been too subtle to correlate them to microbial composition. In contrast to the study from Steenhuijsen Piters et al., we chose to follow a more unbiased approach and therefore we did not stratify for &#x02018;nasotypes&#x02019; on forehand. This may have led to the fact that we could not confirm a relation between <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and disease severity.

Because the peak incidence of (severe) bronchiolitis is below the age of 6&#x000a0;months, and to limit the variation in age-related effects on microbiome and inflammatory response, we only included the children younger than 6&#x000a0;months with a PCR-confirmed RSV infection. Healthy age-matched controls admitted to the hospital for surgery, who needed an elective inguinal hernia correction and had no signs of respiratory infection and a negative PCR for RSV, were included. We obtained permission from the medical ethical commission of the Radboud University Medical Center to collect control samples during 1&#x000a0;year, resulting in 21 samples as used in this study. Patients younger than 6&#x000a0;months with PCR-confirmed RSV-positive bronchiolitis were selected and divided into three groups. Children without hypoxemia were classified as &#x02018;mildly ill&#x02019;; &#x02018;moderately ill&#x02019; children received supplemental oxygen, while &#x02018;severely ill&#x02019; children required mechanical ventilation. Patients with congenital heart or lung disease, immunodeficiency, or glucocorticoid use were excluded. Within 24&#x000a0;h after admission, a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected and parents from hospitalized children were asked for permission to collect a second NPA sample 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;weeks after admission (recovery).
