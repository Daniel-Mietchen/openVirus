 <caption> Chemokine and cytokine levels during RSV infection. Chemokine and cytokine levels in nasopharyngeal aspirates of healthy, RSV-infected individuals with different disease severities ( a, b). In general, host responses are observed to be negatively ( a) or positively ( b) correlated with RSV severity. Data is presented in pg/ml. Statistics in these plots were obtained by Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA, with Dunn’s correction for multiple testing. Significances are as follows: * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001 </caption>
