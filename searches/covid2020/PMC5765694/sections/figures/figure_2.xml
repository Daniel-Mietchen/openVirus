 <caption>
  <p>Nasopharyngeal microbiota composition in healthy and RSV-infected infants. Each leaf of the tree represents a single sample. Samples were clustered based on beta diversity (‘between-sample distance’), using weighted UniFrac as a distance measure and hierarchical UPGMA as a clustering method. Vertical bars show the relative abundance microbiota composition on the genus level (reads that could not be classified up to this level are in white). The 20 most dominant genera are shown in the legend. Colored sample labels represent sample classes: mild (orange), moderate (light red), or severe (dark red) disease; healthy control (green); and recovery (blue) samples. The figure was generated with the interactive tree of life (iTOL) program</p>
