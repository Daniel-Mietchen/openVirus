  <p>RSV disease, viral load, and CXCL8 levels in healthy and RSV-infected individuals can be explained by nasopharyngeal microbial makeup (genus-level). Redundancy analysis (RDA) biplots are shown. Nasopharyngeal genus-level microbiota from healthy and RSV-infected individuals are significantly different, irrespective of disease severity (
   <bold>a</bold>) (according to a permutation test; 
   <italic>p</italic> value = 0.001). Triangles are the centroids of the study sample groups: RSV (red) and healthy control (green). RDA of RSV-infected individuals (healthy and recovery samples were excluded from analysis) shows that nasopharyngeal genus-level microbiota can significantly be separated based on viral load (
   <bold>b</bold>) (Ct threshold plotted: higher Ct number corresponds to higher number of PCR cycles before confident virus detection, hence lower viral load; 
   <italic>p</italic> value = 0.036). For 
   <bold>a</bold> and 
   <bold>b</bold>, the blue arrows are the 10 best-fitting genera (names in italic), which are the genera best explaining microbiota compositional differences between disease status (
   <bold>a</bold>) or different levels of RSV virus (
   <bold>b</bold>) as plotted on the horizontal axis. RDA of healthy and RSV-infected individuals shows that nasopharyngeal genus-level microbiota can significantly be separated based on levels of CXCL8 (
   <bold>c</bold>) (
   <italic>p</italic> value = 0.036; log transformation was set to 1000). The first component (horizontal axis) is optimized to explain CXCL8 level based on microbiota relative abundances (concentration of CXCL8 in pg/μl). Correspondingly, the blue arrows are the genera (names in italic) explaining at least 5% of this variation. RDA was corrected for age, gender, and birth weight. See Additional file
