  <p>Chemokine and cytokine levels during RSV infection. Chemokine and cytokine levels in nasopharyngeal aspirates of healthy, RSV-infected individuals with different disease severities (
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold>). In general, host responses are observed to be negatively (
   <bold>a</bold>) or positively (
   <bold>b</bold>) correlated with RSV severity. Data is presented in pg/ml. Statistics in these plots were obtained by Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA, with Dunn’s correction for multiple testing. Significances are as follows: *
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***
