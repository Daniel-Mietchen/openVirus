   <p>Potential confounding characteristics of this study. Figure S2 RSV disease and viral load in healthy and RSV-infected individuals can be explained by nasopharyngeal microbial makeup (OTU-level). Figure S3 Species richness, but not diversity, is reduced in RSV-infected infants. Figure S4 Difference in 
    <italic>Achromobacter</italic>, 
    <italic>Veillonella</italic>, and 
    <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> abundance between healthy and RSV-infected individuals with different disease severities. Figure S5 RSV-infected individuals with mild disease symptoms display an ‘intermediate’ nasopharyngeal microbiota compositional profile in comparison to moderate/severe disease and their recovery controls. Figure S6 Chemokine and cytokine levels during RSV infection and upon recovery. Figure S7 Comparison of OTUs from current study to 
    <italic>Haemophilus</italic> reference species shows that 
    <italic>Haemophilus</italic>-classified OTUs are predominantly belonging to 
    <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> species. (DOCX 968 kb)
