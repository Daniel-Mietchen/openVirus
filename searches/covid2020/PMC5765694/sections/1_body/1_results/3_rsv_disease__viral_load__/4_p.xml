<p id="Par38">The above-described genus-level RDA analyses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) were repeated with higher resolution OTU-level microbiota data (clustering on 97.0%), and on this level of taxonomical detail, similar statistical significances and microbial associations were observed (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). Mainly, OTUs classified to genus or species of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> were found to be important in driving these outcomes and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> to a lesser extent. However, we did lose significance for the association of CXCL8 with microbiota on the level of OTU in comparison to genus (
 <italic>p = 0.036</italic> to 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.089; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2C), which might in part be governed by birth weight, as removal of birth weight as confounding factor resulted in restoring of statistical significance as observed at the level of genus (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02; data not shown). Interestingly, OTU-level analysis of microbiota associated with RSV viral load provided increased insight with regard to 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic>-classified OTUs, as these best explained association with viral load but not other OTUs in the top 10 response variables (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2B). Furthermore, the above-described association of 
 <italic>Helcococcus</italic> with levels of CXCL8 was not observed on the level of OTU (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2C) and, instead, was likewise best explained by OTUs classified as 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> taxa. In conclusion, 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> seems to be a strong correlate to the outcome for clinical manifestation of RSV disease, viral load, and CXCL8 immune response.
