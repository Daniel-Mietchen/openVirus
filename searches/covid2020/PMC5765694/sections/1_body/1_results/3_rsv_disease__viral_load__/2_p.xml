<p id="Par36">We found that RSV viral load (as determined with qPCR, Ct) in nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients was associated significantly with total nasopharyngeal microbiota composition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b; RDA 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.036), although no statistically different viral loads between the patient RSV severity stratifications could be detected (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1A). However, because the response variables of the data in the RDA are also strongly oriented in the vertical direction, this indicates that separation based on genus-level microbiota is not primarily driven by the viral load contrast.
