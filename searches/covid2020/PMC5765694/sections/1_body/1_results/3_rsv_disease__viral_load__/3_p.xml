<p id="Par37">Furthermore, RDA of healthy and RSV-infected individuals showed that nasopharyngeal genus-level microbiota can significantly be separated based on levels of CXCL8 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c; RDA 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.036) but not for any of the other candidate markers (data not shown). Strikingly, in this RDA, 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> is among the most important genera contributing to the observed separation, as its arrow points to CXCL8 in a strong horizontal direction. 
 <italic>Helcococcus</italic>, although its arrow is also strongly horizontally oriented, has a very low abundance (0.01% on average).
