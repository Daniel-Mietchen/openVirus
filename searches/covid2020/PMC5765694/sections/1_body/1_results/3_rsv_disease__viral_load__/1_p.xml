<p id="Par35">To examine the microbial involvement in RSV disease processes, redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed and showed a strong and significant separation of RSV patients and healthy controls based on NPA microbial makeup (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). This difference in contrast is mainly characterized by 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> and 
 <italic>Achromobacter</italic>, not by 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>, as this bacterium is only represented by three RSV samples with &lt; 0.01% relative abundance each. Both viral load and host immune responses are hypothesized to play a major role in the disease processes, through which microbiota could potentially (directly or indirectly) assert their effect on the pathophysiology and the course of disease. Therefore, we further focused on differences in microbiota content between different viral loads and host cytokines and chemokines that were previously described to be relevant in RSV disease (CCL5, CXCL8/IL8, CXCL10, IL6, and MMP9) [
