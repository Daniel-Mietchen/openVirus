<p id="Par34">16S rRNA marker gene Illumina sequencing (16S) of the V3-V4 region was used to study the consortia of bacteria present in the NPA samples. By adopting a customized QIIME-based workflow for analysis of sequencing reads, we were able to classify 97.6% of sequencing reads with confidence to the genus-level and study-wide identified a total of 156 unique genera (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2 and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3). Sufficient sequencing reads and OTU (operational taxonomic unit) counts for each sample were realized with an average of 25k ± 15k SD reads and 162 ± 51 SD OTUs, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). We identified

 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (29.4%), 
 <italic>Moraxella</italic> (10.7%), 
 <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> (6.89%), and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> (2.9%) as the main genera (and known to be typically present) in the nasopharynx (Fig.

 <italic>Prevotella</italic> (4.2%), 
 <italic>Achromobacter</italic> (3.6%), 
 <italic>Neisseria</italic> (2.2%), and 
 <italic>Veillonella</italic> (1.4%) representing additional genera (Fig.
