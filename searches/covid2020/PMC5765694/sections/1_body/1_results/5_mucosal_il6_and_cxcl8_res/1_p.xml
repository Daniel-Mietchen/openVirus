<p id="Par40">Local host response measurements in the NPA indicated that cytokines and chemokines are either negatively (CCL5, CXCL10, and MMP9; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) or positively (CXCL8 and IL6; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b) correlating with RSV disease severity. This was statistically confirmed for IL6 and CXCL8 by Spearman correlation (
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.0009/rho = 0.39 and 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.0001/rho = 0.51, respectively; uncorrected), although between RSV sample groups only, we did not find significant differences with ANOVA. As severity measure based on oxygen and mechanical ventilation requirement is a non-continuous value, we validated the above numbers by correlating with duration of hospital stay, which is an accepted measure of RSV severity, and found similar correlations (
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.0005/rho = 0.41 and 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.0003/rho = 0.46, for IL6 and CXCL8, respectively; uncorrected). Furthermore, paired analysis with recovery samples indicated that the IL6 and CXCL8 cytokine responses were restored to normal levels after recovery from RSV disease, as the responses after recovery were significantly lower than for their corresponding sample upon disease (IL6 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02; CXCL8 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005; Additional file
