<p id="Par42">Interestingly, based on an extended in silico analysis of the dominant 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic>-level-classified OTUs detected in this study (&gt; 0.01% average relative abundance, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10), we conclude that 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> data described in this study predominantly belongs to the species of 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S7)
 <italic>.</italic> The top 10 most abundant 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic>-classified OTUs together comprise 99.65% of the reads belonging to all 361 detected 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> genus OTUs (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4). Of these 10 OTUs, one could confidently be assigned to 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>parainfluenzae</italic> and comprise 0.25% of all reads in this study, and two other OTUs were assigned to an unknown cluster (0.31%). The remaining seven OTUs, the major fraction of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic>-assigned reads, could confidently be assigned to 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>influenza</italic> (27.7% of all reads in this study). Other candidate taxa involved in the RDA separation, such as 
 <italic>Achromobacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Veillonella</italic>, and 
 <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> were not highly abundant in the overall microbiome and did not correlate with disease severity (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S4). In conclusion, RSV is marked by a strong increase in 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> and to lesser extent 
 <italic>Achromobacter</italic>, but RSV disease severity cannot be related to microbiota composition.
