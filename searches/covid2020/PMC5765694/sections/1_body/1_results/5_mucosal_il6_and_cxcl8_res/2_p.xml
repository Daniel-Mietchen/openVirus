<p id="Par41">In line with our findings as described above, RDA indicated that healthy infants and RSV-infected patients do indeed display very distinct microbial patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a; RDA 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007). However, this RDA separation seemed to be primarily driven by disease state rather than disease severity, as an additional RDA on the subset of RSV patients alone did not yield convincing nor significant separation of RSV severity groups (data not shown; RDA 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.75). Correspondingly, levels of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> did not differ significantly between patient groups with distinct disease severities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b); although in comparison to control subjects, 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> levels were higher in moderate and severe patients than in mild.
