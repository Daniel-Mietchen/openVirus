<p id="Par32">We retrospectively selected a cohort of 54 infant patients younger than 6 months of age, who were hospitalized with an RSV infection, and 21 age-matched healthy infants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1A). Patients were stratified based on severity of RSV disease using clinically defined parameters as follows: mild disease included children without hypoxemia (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9); moderate disease included children receiving supplemental oxygen (
 <italic>n</italic> = 27); and severe disease included children requiring mechanical ventilation (
 <italic>n</italic> = 18) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). We collected nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples from a subset of RSV patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25) 4–6 weeks after hospital discharge, enabling us to evaluate mucosal immune responses and the microbiome after recovery of disease (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2, 16, and 7, for mild, moderate, and severe, respectively). NPA samples were collected in which bacterial composition, viral load, and host immune responses were measured to allow for integrated analysis (Fig.
