<p id="Par33">To account for potential confounding variables, we screened our cohort on various parameters such as gender, age, (birth) weight, and RSV viral load (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). Infant age (and gender to a minor extent) was found to be unevenly distributed over our cohort, which is likely a consequence of age being a known risk factor for developing (severe) RSV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Birth weight, although not significantly different between study groups, did show a trend towards being increased in RSV patients in comparison to healthy infants. Antibiotic use was evenly distributed over the RSV patient severity stratifications (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); none of the healthy infants used antibiotics at time of enrollment. Altogether, this prompted us to correct for age, gender, and birth weight effects in multivariate analyses throughout this study. We also assessed viral co-infections, for which we found that only coronavirus (11%) and rhinovirus (20%) had a high prevalence. However, patients with these co-infections appeared to be randomly distributed in the disease severity stratifications (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1B).
