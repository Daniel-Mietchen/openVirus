<p id="Par39">Further evaluation of microbial nasopharyngeal (alpha) diversity between study groups suggested that RSV infection is characterized by decreased species richness (
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.006; MWU, corrected), which is more pronounced in moderate and severe disease compared to controls (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.016 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.024) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S3A and S3C). Regarding species diversity, no significant differences associated with RSV-infected infants or severity of disease were found (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S3B and S3D). A trend in reduction of species diversity in RSV patients was observed here (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.098), and this species diversity, interestingly, is partly restored after disease recovery (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.060, uncorrected; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3B). Furthermore, microbial makeup of the nasopharynx of RSV-infected compared to healthy individuals was characterized by a strong and significant overrepresentation of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), increasing from 11.8 to 37.8% relative abundance (
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.011; MWU, corrected) and (with lower abundance) of 
 <italic>Achromobacter</italic> (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S4A; increasing from 0.7 to 4.7%; 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.001). After recovery from RSV disease, based on a paired sample analysis, the level of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> was restored in these infants and was found to be similar to the level of healthy volunteers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). In contrast, a significant underrepresentation of 
 <italic>Veillonella</italic> and 
 <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> was observed during RSV infection (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S4B and S4C), which however might be a consequence of the increase of the aforementioned bacteria. On a side note, 
 <italic>Moraxella</italic> appeared to be primarily present in recovery samples from RSV-infected individuals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S5). In conclusion, RSV infection caused a strong microbial perturbation characterized by presence of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> and 
 <italic>Achromobacter</italic>.
