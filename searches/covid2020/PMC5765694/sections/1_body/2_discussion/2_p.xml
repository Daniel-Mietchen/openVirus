<p id="Par44">A multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA) could separate healthy controls from RSV-infected infants but could not separate microbiomes based on the level of disease severity. In the study of Steenhuijsen Piters et al., the authors concluded that the microbiota composition might affect the clinical severity, but we were unable to reproduce these findings, perhaps because different RSV severity measures were applied. Nevertheless, a strong and significant overrepresentation of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> was found in RSV-infected children, especially in severe and moderate disease. In a recent study, Rosas-Salazar and coworkers observed a similar increase of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> in infants with acute RSV infection compared to healthy controls and also of 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Moraxella</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In line with these and our own findings, Hasegawa and coworkers reported that infants with RSV infection and 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic>-dominant profiles had higher odds of intensive care use than RSV-infected infants with profiles dominated by other bacteria, such as 
 <italic>Moraxella</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the MARC-35 bronchiolitis cohort by Mansbach and coworkers, lower levels of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic>/
 <italic>Moraxella</italic> were found in the nasopharynx of RSV-infected infants in comparison to rhinovirus; however, this study had no data on healthy infants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although in our studies 
 <italic>Achromobacter</italic> shows a much lower abundance than 
 <italic>Haemophilus,</italic> it appeared to be also dominant in RSV-infected infants. Apart from a few studies describing the association of 
 <italic>Achromobacter xyloxosidans</italic> with pneumonia in newborns and young infants, and chronic infection in cystic fibrosis patients, not much is known about this species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Much more in vitro and in vivo evidence is present with regard to increased susceptibility for viral infections and increased inflammatory responses associated with 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> colonization and infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it is shown that the composition of the microbial colonization in the nasopharynx is associated with a higher RSV load, with 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> (
 <italic>influenzae</italic>) as most prominent candidate contributing to these differences (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2B). Interaction of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> with epithelial cells may lead to the suppression of anti-viral immune pathways allowing increased replication. An alternative explanation would be that RSV facilitates the colonization of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic>. However, no evidence for any of the two hypotheses can be found in the current literature. The 
 <italic>Helcococcus</italic> genus
 <italic>,</italic> another lead based on our reported association with levels of CXCL8 in the NPA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c), is not likely to have a great impact on its niche, as it is very lowly abundant (0.01% on average), and is only represented by three RSV patients, and the association was not observed at the level of OTUs. The increase in IL6 and CXCL-8 responses in RSV patients colonized with 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> as found in our study corroborates a recent in vitro study by Gulraiz et al. They showed that release of IL6 and CXCL-8 after RSV infection, but not rhinovirus infection, was synergistically increased in 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> pre-treated human bronchial epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], suggesting that the interaction between 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>influenzae</italic>, CXCL8, and RSV may be specific for RSV infections. It should finally be noted that other cytokine responses than the ones studied here might be important for RSV pathogenesis, such as T-helper 1, T-helper 2, and T-regulatory cell type cytokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Their potential involvement with the nasopharyngeal microbiome during RSV pathogenesis can therefore not be confirmed within the current study.
