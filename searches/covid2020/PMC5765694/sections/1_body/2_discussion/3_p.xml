<p id="Par45">Interestingly, Steenhuijsen Piters et al. recently reported an enhanced (non-significant) CXCL8 gene expression response, measured in a whole blood transcriptome analysis, that was associated with nasopharyngeal microbiomes that were dominated by 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In our study, we are able to show a significant association between nasopharyngeal CXCL8 levels and RSV infection and even with disease severity. Although presence of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> was related to the levels of CXCL8, we could not confirm a direct relation between the composition of the microbiome and disease severity. A possible explanation could be that although we stratified the patients on severity level, all patients included in our study were hospitalized and therefore severely ill. The differences in disease severity might have been too subtle to correlate them to microbial composition. In contrast to the study from Steenhuijsen Piters et al., we chose to follow a more unbiased approach and therefore we did not stratify for ‘nasotypes’ on forehand. This may have led to the fact that we could not confirm a relation between 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and disease severity. In a previous study, we even found a reversed relation between 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and disease severity, although this was based on qPCR data and not on 16S sequencing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. It should also be noted that although we rigorously corrected our data analyses for a number of potential confounders (i.e., age, gender, and birth weight), we did not have socioeconomic information of our cohort, nor on mode-of-delivery, which can be seen as limitation of this study.
