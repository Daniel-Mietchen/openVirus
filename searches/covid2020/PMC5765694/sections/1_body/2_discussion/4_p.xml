<p id="Par46">In conclusion, although no association of the nasopharyngeal microbiota to disease severity was found, we show that RSV infection affects the microbiota composition. 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic>-dominated profiles were in part associated with an increased viral load and increased IL6 and CXCL-8 responses on the genus level of, and these effects were even stronger on the level of OTU (
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>). Upon recovery, 
 <italic>Moraxella</italic> appears to thrive in the previously RSV-perturbed microbiomes. A better understanding of the mechanisms behind the influence of the microbiota on these host-virus processes is needed and should be the focus of future research. Improved insight in microbiome effects on RSV pathogenesis might pave the way for new preventive and therapeutic strategies to reduce the burden by RSV disease.
