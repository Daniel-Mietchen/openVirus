<p id="Par29">To date, it is thought that the host response to the virus contributes most prominently to the key features of bronchiolitis, marked by swelling of the mucosa, secretion of mucus, and eventually obstruction of the smaller airways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, high viral load in the lungs and nasopharynx have been found in children with severe infection, suggesting that viral replication also contributes to increased pathology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. During the inflammatory response induced by the virus, cytokines and chemokines are released and attract circulating leukocytes to the site of infection. As recently reviewed by Russel et al., CXCL-8 and CXL-10 have been associated with immune pathology, whereas CCL-5 in general is associated with a more beneficial immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It seems that a balanced inflammatory response with influx of immune cells is crucial, as indicated by near absence of cytotoxic CD8 cells in fatal cases of RSV bronchiolitis and the presence of massive influx of neutrophils in the lumen of the airways of most severe infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The importance of the inflammatory response in the development of severe disease is further underlined by the association of the level of circulating immune cells and secreted cytokines with disease severity [
