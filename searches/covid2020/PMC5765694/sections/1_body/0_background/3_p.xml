<p id="Par30">Respiratory mucosal surfaces are colonized directly after birth with bacteria from the mother, and the composition changes dramatically during the first years of life depending on genetics and environmental factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These commensal bacteria release components such as lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans that have been shown to pass the epithelial barrier of the mucosal lining under non-inflammatory conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This translocation of bacterial products increases during inflammation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Induction of the initial innate immune response in epithelial cells and immune cells by RSV and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines should therefore be considered in the presence of these bacterial products [
