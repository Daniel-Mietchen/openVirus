<p id="Par28">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory tract infections in young children that frequently leads to hospitalization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The clinical symptoms vary from upper respiratory tract infection to severe bronchiolitis with respiratory insufficiency for which mechanical ventilation is needed. Despite the high disease burden of RSV in young children, no antivirals, vaccines, or other targeted treatments for bronchiolitis have proven to be beneficial yet, and therefore, only supportive care is currently recommended [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Prematurity, young age (&lt; 6 months), and the presence of siblings or daycare attendance are important risk factors for severe RSV disease requiring hospitalization and respiratory support, indicating that development of the immune system as well as environmental factors plays a role in the pathogenesis of RSV bronchiolitis [
