<p id="Par31">Findings from the MARC-35 bronchiolitis cohort by Mansbach and coworkers, a prospective study of 1016 infants below 1Â year of age hospitalized with bronchiolitis, underpin the importance of bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract during viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. They show that depending on infection with RSV and rhinovirus, different compositions of nasopharyngeal microbiota are found, mainly higher levels of 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic>/
 <italic>Moraxella,</italic> respectively. Steenhuijsen Piters and co-workers recently showed that clusters characterized by the dominance of 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> (
 <italic>influenzae</italic>) and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> were positively associated with RSV infection and RSV-related hospitalization, based on nasopharyngeal microbiota clusters that were stratified prior to analyses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, they reported enhanced expression of host genes linked to inflammation and immune signaling in patients with the two microbiota clusters (
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> dominated), suggesting that interactions between RSV and specific components of the nasopharyngeal microbiota modulate the host immune response, potentially driving clinical disease severity. These findings are further supported by the association of specific metabolic profiles in respiratory samples with severe bronchiolitis, which could be linked to the composition of the microbiome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this study, we investigate the association of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, without prior stratification on microbiota types, to RSV load, nasopharyngeal cytokine responses, and the association with disease severity.
