<p id="Par47">Severity of RSV infection in infants is determined by several factors. A growing body of evidence suggests that the nasopharyngeal microbiome may play an important role and influence both the local immune response as well as viral load. Interactions between RSV, local mucosal nasopharyngeal microbial content, and the plethora of host factors involved are not well enough understood to explain severity of disease. This retrospective study using a well-characterized cohort of young children with RSV infection and age-matched healthy controls shows for the first time that composition of nasopharyngeal microbiota associates with CXCL8 levels in RSV patients. CXCL8 is an important chemokine that correlated with RSV disease severity. 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> was identified as the most important genus associating with the amplitude of the CXCL8 response. Host-microbe interactions are increasingly recognized as important factors in determining outcome of host processes. Our findings show a strong interdependency between the nasopharyngeal microbiota and the mucosal immune response, potentially influencing severity of disease. These data contribute to a better understanding of the importance of commensal microbiota in respiratory health and disease.
