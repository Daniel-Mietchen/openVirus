<p id="Par51">Illumina 16S rRNA amplicon libraries were generated and sequenced at BaseClear BV (Leiden, The Netherlands) on an Illumina MiSeq paired-end 300 system. Sequencing data analysis was performed by QIIME and is more elaborately described in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Supplementary Methods. The Ribosomal Database Project [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] classifier version 2.3 was performed for taxonomic classification of the sequence reads. Alpha diversity metrics (PD whole tree, Chao1, Observed Species, and Shannon) were calculated by bootstrapping 4822 reads per sample and taking the average over 10 trials. Figures resulting from QIIME clustering analyses were generated using the interactive tree of life (iTOL) tool [
