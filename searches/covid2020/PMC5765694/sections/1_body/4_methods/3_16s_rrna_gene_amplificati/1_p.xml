 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Supplementary Methods. To generate the PCR amplicon libraries, sample-specific barcoded amplicons for the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA 16S genes were generated using a two-step PCR. Ten to twenty-five nanograms genomic (g)DNA was used as template for the first PCR with a total volume of 50 μl using the 341F (5’-CCT ACG GGN GGC WGC AG-3′) and the 785R (5’-GAC TAC HVG GGT ATC TAA TCC-3′) primers appended with Illumina adaptor sequences.
