<p id="Par48">This study was performed in two hospitals in Nijmegen, Radboud University Medical Center and Canisius Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis (CWZ). From the area of Nijmegen, children younger than 2 years of age with laboratory-confirmed RSV infections were prospectively included during three consecutive winter seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012, and 2012/2013), if they were hospitalized to the pediatric ward or intensive care unit (PICU) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents. Because the peak incidence of (severe) bronchiolitis is below the age of 6 months, and to limit the variation in age-related effects on microbiome and inflammatory response, we only included the children younger than 6 months with a PCR-confirmed RSV infection. Healthy age-matched controls admitted to the hospital for surgery, who needed an elective inguinal hernia correction and had no signs of respiratory infection and a negative PCR for RSV, were included. We obtained permission from the medical ethical commission of the Radboud University Medical Center to collect control samples during 1 year, resulting in 21 samples as used in this study. Patients younger than 6 months with PCR-confirmed RSV-positive bronchiolitis were selected and divided into three groups. Children without hypoxemia were classified as ‘mildly ill’; ‘moderately ill’ children received supplemental oxygen, while ‘severely ill’ children required mechanical ventilation. Patients with congenital heart or lung disease, immunodeficiency, or glucocorticoid use were excluded. Within 24 h after admission, a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected and parents from hospitalized children were asked for permission to collect a second NPA sample 4–6 weeks after admission (recovery). The final study cohort as reported here existed of
