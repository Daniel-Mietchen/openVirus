 <caption> Total and proportion of influenza virus reads derived by Nanopore sequencing of individual samples across a range of C T values. C T values were derived by testing using the GeneXpert (Cepheid) assay in a clinical diagnostic laboratory. Left, correlation between C T value and total number of influenza virus reads generated. R 2 = 0.604, P = 2.47e−08. Right, correlation between C T value and number of influenza virus reads per million reads. R 2 = 0.623, P = 1.07e−08. </caption>
