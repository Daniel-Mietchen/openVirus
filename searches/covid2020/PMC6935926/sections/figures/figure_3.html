 <caption> Coverage of influenza virus and Hazara virus genome segments achieved by Nanopore sequencing from pooled samples (A) Data from three dilution series of pooled influenza virus-positive samples, diluted with three separate negative-sample pools to generate different titers of influenza virus. Each individual dilution was spiked with Hazara virus at 10 4 genome copies/ml. The proportion of genome covered at 1Ã— depth is shown for each of the eight influenza virus genome segments (encoding PB2 [polymerase subunit 2], PB1 [polymerase subunit 1], PA [polymerase acidic protein], HA [hemagglutinin], NP [nucleocapsid protein], NA [neuraminidase], M [matrix protein], and NS [nonstructural protein]) across the three dilution series. For simplicity, the coverage of the Hazara virus genome is plotted as the total of all three genome segments. (B) Representative coverage plots of influenza A virus genome segments from the dilution series 1 sample at 10 4 influenza virus copies per ml. </caption>
