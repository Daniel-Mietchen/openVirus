  <p>Characteristics of three pools of influenza virus-negative throat swabs and Nanopore sequence results following spiking with influenza A virus. (A) Total concentration of cDNA produced per pooled sample following amplification by the SISPA reaction, grouped by dilution series. The 10
   <sup>6</sup> genome copies/ml sample in each pool is the original, undiluted material, represented by the black bars. Samples diluted to influenza virus titers of 10
   <sup>4</sup>, 10
   <sup>3</sup>, and 10
   <sup>2</sup> contain more cDNA due to higher background material (bacterial/human) present in the diluent. Dilution series 1 and 2 contain comparable amounts of background material; dilution series 3 contains substantially more background. (B) Viral reads generated by Nanopore sequencing of samples with different titers of influenza A virus and a consistent titer of Hazara virus (10
   <sup>4</sup> genome copies/ml). Graphs show reads per million of total reads mapping to influenza A or Hazara virus genomes, across the three individual dilution series. Note the logarithmic scale on the 
   <italic>y</italic> axis.
