 <caption> Characteristics of three pools of influenza virus-negative throat swabs and Nanopore sequence results following spiking with influenza A virus. (A) Total concentration of cDNA produced per pooled sample following amplification by the SISPA reaction, grouped by dilution series. The 10 6 genome copies/ml sample in each pool is the original, undiluted material, represented by the black bars. Samples diluted to influenza virus titers of 10 4, 10 3, and 10 2 contain more cDNA due to higher background material (bacterial/human) present in the diluent. Dilution series 1 and 2 contain comparable amounts of background material; dilution series 3 contains substantially more background. (B) Viral reads generated by Nanopore sequencing of samples with different titers of influenza A virus and a consistent titer of Hazara virus (10 4 genome copies/ml). Graphs show reads per million of total reads mapping to influenza A or Hazara virus genomes, across the three individual dilution series. Note the logarithmic scale on the y axis. </caption>
