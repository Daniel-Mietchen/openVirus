      <p>Influenza is a major global public health threat as a result of its highly pathogenic
         variants, large zoonotic reservoir, and pandemic potential. Metagenomic viral sequencing
         offers the potential for a diagnostic test for influenza virus which also provides
         insights on transmission, evolution, and drug resistance and simultaneously detects
         other viruses. We therefore set out to apply the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing
         method to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples.
