<p>Within the 50 clinical samples sequenced, we found limited evidence for the presence of other RNA viruses. Sample 6 produced 109 reads mapping to human coronavirus in addition to &gt;1.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> influenza A virus reads, suggesting coinfection. We also derived &gt;4.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> reads from human metapneumovirus from an influenza virus-negative sample, providing a nearly complete genome (99.8% coverage) from one sample (Fig. S1, sample I), further detailed previously (
