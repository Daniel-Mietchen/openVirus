<p>At the higher

  <sub>T</sub>

 <italic>C
  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic>, 30 to 40), the sensitivity of Nanopore sequencing was reduced compared to that of the current PCR-based test (GeneXpert assay; Cepheid). Further optimization will be required to maximize the diagnostic yield from this group of samples without sacrificing specificity.
