<p>Future application of this method will involve real-time laboratory testing of respiratory samples, running the platform head to head with existing clinical diagnostics to further assess sensitivity and specificity, and using influenza virus sequence data to investigate transmission events. Identifying instances of nosocomial transmission may shed light on health care-acquired infection, thus helping to improve infection control practice. Assessment of diversity within deep-sequence data sets provides an opportunity to investigate the relationship between within-host polymorphisms and clinical outcomes. Long-read sequences confer the potential advantage of identifying viral haplotypes and ascertaining the extent to which significant polymorphisms are transmitted together or independently (

We have shown that the method is robust for the identification of commonly circulating influenza virus strains in human populations, but further investigation is required to ascertain the extent to which it performs reliably in other (avian and animal) strains.
