<p>Despite time reductions in wet-laboratory processing, this method requires further modification to simplify and accelerate the protocol if it is to become viable as a near-to-patient test. High error rates are a recognized concern in Nanopore sequence data, and cross-barcode contamination can create challenges when low- and high-titer samples are batched (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). To avoid these problems, we batched samples according to 
 <italic>C
  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic> value and applied stringent barcode demultiplexing criteria; however, this reduces the total data available for analysis, typically by âˆ¼50% but with variation between sequencing runs (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). For future primary diagnostic use, it would be preferable to sequence samples individually using a lower-throughput flow cell, e.g., ONT Flongle (each paired with a negative-extraction-control sample, for which a prior spike with Hazara virus, using the same methods described here, would remain appropriate). Careful optimization of laboratory and bioinformatic methods is required to resolve individual sequence polymorphisms, particularly for drug resistance alleles.
