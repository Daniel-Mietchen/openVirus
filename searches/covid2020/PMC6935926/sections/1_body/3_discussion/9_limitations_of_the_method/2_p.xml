<p>In summary, while substantial further work is needed, our methods show promise for generating influenza virus sequences directly from respiratory samples. The “pathogen-agnostic” metagenomic sequencing approach offers an opportunity for simultaneous testing for a wide range of potential pathogens, providing a faster route to optimum treatment and contributing to antimicrobial stewardship. Longer term, this approach has promise as a routine laboratory test, providing data to inform treatment, vaccine design and deployment, infection control policies, and surveillance.</p>
