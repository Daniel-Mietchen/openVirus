<p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of successfully applying metagenomic Nanopore sequencing directly to respiratory samples to detect influenza virus and generate influenza virus sequences. The approach demonstrates excellent specificity. Sensitivity varies by viral titer but is comparable to that of existing laboratory diagnostic tests for 
 <italic>C
  <sub>T</sub>
 </italic> values of &lt;30. Our optimized protocol depletes human and bacterial nucleic acids and reduces the time from sample to sequence. This method has the potential to be further optimized and validated to improve sensitivity for influenza virus, identify other RNA viruses, detect drug resistance mutations, and provide insights into quasispecies diversity (
