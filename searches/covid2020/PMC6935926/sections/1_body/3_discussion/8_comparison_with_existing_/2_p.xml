<p>Alternative approaches to generate sequence data include amplicon-based sequencing of the influenza virus genome (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, this approach detects only the target pathogen, requiring multiple assays or more complex multiplex primer schemes to add targets and capture diverse strains of the original target. The use of short-read Illumina sequencing instead of Nanopore sequencing for metagenomic sequencing of influenza virus (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) provides the current gold standard of sequence quality and some potential cost savings per base of sequence generated. However, our data show that at a relatively modest minimum coverage depth of 10Ã—, Nanopore-generated consensus viral genome sequences are 99.95 to 100% identical to Illumina sequences. Of the 13 samples compared, 12 samples were 100% concordant. The few bases that differed between the technologies in a single sample appear to be clear in each case and a genuine disagreement between the long- and short-read approaches, rather than simply being due to the higher per-base error rate of Nanopore
