<p>The per-read differences in base accuracy are also compensated for by the increased read length, providing further confidence in the case of individual read taxonomic assignment. Consideration of relative costs must also take into account other cost-saving attributes. These include the substantially lower infrastructure and startup costs of Nanopore sequencing, the unique ability to interrogate sequence data as they are generated in real time, and the potential for the portable MinION device to be utilized near to patient, potentially decreasing turnaround time, particularly for high-virus-load samples which may be identified within minutes. The throughput of the Nanopore flow cells allows for a small number of samples to be run immediately rather than requiring samples to be batched to reach a number sufficient to cost efficiently run a greater-throughput short-read sequencing device. In the future, the use of an even lower-throughput flow cell with the ONT Flongle adaptor may allow individual samples to be run per cell, offering quicker turnaround per sample and minimizing cross-sample contamination. A summary table comparing the different approaches is included in supplemental material (Table S3).</p>
