<p>Multiplex sequencing libraries were prepared using 250 ng of cDNA from up to 12 samples as input to the SQK-LSK108 or SQK-LSK109 kit and barcoded individually using the EXP-NBD103 Native barcodes (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and a modified One-pot protocol (

Libraries were sequenced on FLO-MIN106 flow cells on the MinION Mk1b or GridION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), with sequencing proceeding for 48 h. Samples were batched according to the GeneXpert
