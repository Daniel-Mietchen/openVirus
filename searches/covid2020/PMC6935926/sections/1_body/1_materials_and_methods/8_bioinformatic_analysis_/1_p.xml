<p>Nanopore reads were base called using Guppy (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Output base called fastq files were demultiplexed using Porechop v0.2.3 (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop</ext-link>). The reads were first taxonomically classified against the RefSeq database using Centrifuge v1.0.3 (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The reads were then mapped against the reference sequence selected from the Centrifuge report using Minimap2 v2.9 (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). A draft consensus sequence was generated by using a majority voting approach to determine the nucleotide at each position. The resulting draft consensus sequences were subjected to a BLAST search against an influenza virus sequence database that included &gt;2,000 H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal influenza virus sequences between 2018 and 2019 and were downloaded from the Influenza Research Database (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The reads were again mapped against the reference sequence using Minimap2 v2.9, and the number of mapped reads was calculated using SAMtools v1.5 (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and Pysam (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam</ext-link>). The subtype of the influenza A virus derived from each clinical sample was determined by the subtypes of the HA and NA reference sequences. A consensus sequence was built using Nanopolish v0.11.0 (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and the margin_cons.py script (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/zibraproject/zika-pipeline" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://github.com/zibraproject/zika-pipeline</ext-link>). For the Illumina data, reads were quality trimmed to a minimum score of Q30 across the read with Trimmomatic (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). BWA-MEM v0.7.15 (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) was used to align the reads to reference genomes using MEM defaults. SAMtools v1.4 was used to compute the percent reads mapped and coverage depth (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Mapping consensuses for Illumina sequencing were generated using QuasiBam (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Maximum likelihood phylogeny was generated for the HA gene segment using RAxML v8.2.10 (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), in which a general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution and a gamma-distributed rate variation among sites were applied. Sequence alignments were performed by using MUSCLE v3.8 (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).
