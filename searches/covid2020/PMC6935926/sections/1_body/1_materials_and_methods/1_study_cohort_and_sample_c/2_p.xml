<p>For methodological assessment, we focused on four categories of samples, as follows: positive pool, negative pools, individual positive samples, and individual negative samples. For the positive pool, we pooled 19 throat swab samples that had tested positive for influenza A virus in the clinical diagnostic laboratory to provide a large enough sample to assess reproducibility (
