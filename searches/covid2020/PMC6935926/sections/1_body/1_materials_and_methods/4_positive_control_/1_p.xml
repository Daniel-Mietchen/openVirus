<p>Prior to nucleic acid extraction, each sample was spiked with Hazara virus virions to a final concentration of 10
 <sup>4</sup> genome copies per ml as a positive internal control. This is an enveloped negative-stranded RNA virus (genus 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Orthonairovirus</named-content>, order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>) with a trisegmented genome of 11,980, 4,575, and 1,677 nucleotides in length (GenBank accession numbers

It is nonpathogenic in humans and would therefore not be anticipated to arise in any of our clinical samples. Cultured virions from an SW13 cell line were provided by the National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (NCPV; catalog no. 0408084v).
