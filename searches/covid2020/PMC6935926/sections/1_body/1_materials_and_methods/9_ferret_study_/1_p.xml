<p>We applied our sequencing approach to residual samples collected in a previous time course experiment undertaken in a controlled laboratory environment (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). We tested ferret nasal saline wash samples from three independent animals over an 8-day time course, from 3 days prior to first exposure with influenza H1N1pdm09 virus and at days 1, 2, 3, and 5 postinfection. Sampling and plaque assays of the viral titer were described previously (
