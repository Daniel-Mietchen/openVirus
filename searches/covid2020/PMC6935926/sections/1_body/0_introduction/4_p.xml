<p>We therefore aimed to optimize a metagenomic protocol for detecting influenza viruses directly from clinical samples using Nanopore sequencing. We determine its sensitivity compared to that of existing diagnostic methods and its accuracy compared to short-read (Illumina) sequencing, using clinical samples from hospital patients during an influenza season and samples from a controlled laboratory infection in ferrets. Further optimization is required before the Nanopore method can be rolled out as a diagnostic test, but we highlight the potential impact of this technology in advancing molecular diagnostics for respiratory pathogens.</p>
