<p>Currently, most clinical diagnostic tests for influenza virus depend on detecting viral antigen or on PCR amplification of viral nucleic acid derived from respiratory samples (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These two approaches offer trade-offs in benefits, as follows: antigen tests (including point-of-care tests [POCT]) are typically rapid but have low sensitivity (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), while PCR is more time-consuming but more sensitive (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Irrespective of the test used, most clinical diagnostic facilities report a nonquantitative (binary) diagnostic result, and the data routinely generated for influenza diagnosis have limited capacity to inform insights into epidemiological linkage, vaccine efficacy, or antiviral susceptibility. On these grounds, there is an aspiration to generate new diagnostic tests that combine speed (incorporating the potential for POCT [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]), sensitivity, detection of coinfection (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and generation of quantitative or semiquantitative data that can be used to identify drug resistance and reconstruct phylogeny to inform surveillance, public health strategy, and vaccine design.
