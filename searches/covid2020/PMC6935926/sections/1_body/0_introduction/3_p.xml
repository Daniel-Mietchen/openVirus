<p>The application of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to generate full-length influenza virus sequences from clinical respiratory samples can address these challenges. ONT offers a “third-generation,” portable, real-time approach to generating long-read single-molecule sequence data, with demonstrated success across a range of viruses (
