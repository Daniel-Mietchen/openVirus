<p>The ArkDPI-like IBV was isolated from the feces of broiler chickens collected at a commercial farm in North Georgia in 1994 (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The feces were homogenized and passed sequentially through 1.2-μm- and 0.45-μm-pore-size filters (Merck Millipore, USA) to remove bacteria. The filtrate was inoculated into specific-pathogen-free embryonating chicken eggs. The embryos died 48 to 96 h postinoculation and were harvested, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70°C. The Ark-IBV was previously detected in the infected embryo using monoclonal antibodies (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Total nucleic acids were isolated from a preserved 25-year-old pancreas sample of a chicken experimentally inoculated with homogenized infected embryo using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Germany), followed by DNase treatment with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion, USA) to remove host DNA according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Sequence-independent single-primer amplification (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) was used to produce random amplicons that were processed using the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit (Illumina, USA). Next-generation paired-end sequencing (2 × 150 bp) was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using the 300-cycle MiSeq reagent kit v2. A total of 2,146,321 raw paired-end reads were generated. A customized workflow on the Galaxy platform (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) was used to perform preprocessing and assembly of the raw sequencing reads, as described previously (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Briefly, the raw read quality was assessed using FastQC v0.63 (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and the residual adapter sequences were trimmed using Cutadapt v1.6 (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). After the host and control library reads were removed, the overlapping read pairs were joined with PEAR v0.9.6.1 (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Digital normalization via median k-mer abundance was performed using the khmer package v1.1-1 (cutoff = 100, kmer size = 20) (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). 
 <italic>De novo</italic> assembly was performed utilizing MIRA3 v0.0.1 (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) with default settings. The contigs of interest were subjected to a BLASTn search and aligned with the full-length reference genome ArkDPI11 (GenBank accession number 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/EU418976" assigning-authority="genbank" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EU418976</ext-link>) to obtain a draft genome scaffold. The genome consensus was then recalled from 183,511 raw IBV reads using BWA-MEM (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) mapping of trimmed but unnormalized reads to the genome scaffold. The median read depth of the IBV assembly was 444. The final genome consensus of the isolate, designated GA/1359/1994, was 27,617 nucleotides long, excluding the poly(A) tail (100% genome coverage based on reference genome ArkDPI11), and had a 38% GC content. The open reading frames (ORFs) were identified using Geneious v11.1.5 and confirmed by alignment with published IBV genomes. The genome has the typical genetic structure of all IBV strains and contains 13 ORFs (5′-1a/1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3′). A preliminary BLAST comparison to the currently available full-length IBV genome sequences showed the highest (99.87%) nucleotide identity to the virulent Arkansas strain ArkDPI11 (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Detailed phylogenetic analysis based on the complete coding sequence of the S1 gene (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) confirmed that GA/1359/1994 is a member of the GI-9 lineage, clustering in one group along with the lineage prototype strain Ark99/1973 (96.62% nucleotide identity; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/M99482" assigning-authority="genbank" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">M99482</ext-link>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Certain polymorphisms in the S1 gene can often be found in viruses reisolated from chickens vaccinated with the ArkDPI attenuated vaccine. The Y43H and Δ344 mutations are critical for vaccine virus fitness in chicks, as changes at these two positions are most frequently seen in field reisolated viruses compared to the parent vaccine. The S1 gene of GA/1359/1994 had both the Y43H and Δ344 amino acid changes. Despite the ArkDPI vaccine persisting in U.S. flocks (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), there are only sequences of the S1 gene available and no full genomes. This complete genome sequence information would be useful for in-depth understanding of the role that live vaccines play in the recombination of IBVs, which may enhance the virus fitness in chickens.
