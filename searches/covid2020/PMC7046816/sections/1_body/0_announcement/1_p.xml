 <italic>Avian coronavirus</italic> infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>) is a respiratory pathogen that causes severe economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). It has been shown that the ArkDPI live attenuated vaccine can persist in flocks (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), causing a rolling reaction by continuing transmission of the vaccine virus to the unvaccinated chickens, which results in increased virulence of the vaccine and vaccine reactions in the flock (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This is unique to the ArkDPI vaccine and is due to a minor subpopulation in the vaccine, exhibiting polymorphisms in the spike 1 (S1) protein. Reisolation of the ArkDPI vaccine virus from chickens has shown that two amino acid changes in the S1 protein, Y43H and Δ344, are the most common mutations observed (
