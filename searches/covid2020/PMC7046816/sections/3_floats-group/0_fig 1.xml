  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of IBV isolates of the Arkansas-type variant based on the complete S1 gene sequences. The S1 gene sequences of 35 IBV isolates were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database. Together with the sequence obtained in the current study, all sequences were subjected to multiple alignment using the ClustalW algorithm. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the maximum likelihood method based on the general time-reversible model in MEGA v7.0.26. The tree with the highest log likelihood (−3,705.46) is shown. The percentages of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1,000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 36 nucleotide sequences (the sequence from the GI-27 lineage is included as an outgroup). All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 1,617 positions in the final data set. The ArkDPI-derived vaccine, the reisolated ArkDPI-like strains from experimentally vaccinated chickens, and the strain used in this study are shown in red, blue, and bold, respectively.</p>
