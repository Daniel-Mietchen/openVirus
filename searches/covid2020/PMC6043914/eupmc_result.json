    "The 30th International Conference on Antiviral Research was held in Atlanta, GA, USA, from 21 to 25 May 2017. Each year, the International Society for Antiviral Research (ISAR) presents three major awards, this year to Mike Sofia (Elion award), David Chu (Hol√Ω award) and Maaike Everts (Prusoff award). Also this year, the inaugural ISAR Women in Science award lecture was presented by Priscilla Yang. For several years, International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR) has included at least one Keynote lecture, this year there were four. Although there are accounts of only these eight lectures, they reflect the diversity that is characteristic of ICAR - employment (academia, industry, public health), type of research (virus biology, potential antiviral targets, antiviral drugs, research organisation) and a range of viruses. For example, the viruses included were hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus (Mike Sofia), HIV and hepatitis B virus (David Chu), multiple antiviral projects (Maaike Everts), dengue (Priscilla Yang), rhinovirus C (Ann Palmenberg), polio (Mark Pallansch), HIV (Eric Hunter) and Zika virus (Pei-Yong Shi). This report ends with my personal comments giving examples in which this diversity can bring benefits. The 31st ICAR will be in Porto, Portugal, 11-15 June 2018."
