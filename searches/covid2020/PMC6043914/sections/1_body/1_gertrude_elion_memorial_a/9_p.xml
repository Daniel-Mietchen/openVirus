<p>The next key concept was to synthesise a PSI-6206 phosphoramidate prodrug, which would be able to enter liver cells and be metabolised to the monophosphate which is then further phosphorylated to the di- and tri-phosphate. Because the phosphates carry a charge, they remain trapped within the cell. [
 <italic>Phosphoramidate prodrugs were first introduced by Chris McGuigan, a former President of ISAR</italic>.] Although the phosphoramidate approach is well known, there are side chains which can influence the properties of the prodrug. In addition, this approach in the past never demonstrated clinical efficacy and the concept of liver targeting using phosphoramidates was never contemplated. [
 <italic>In his Elion Award lecture at the 2015 ICAR, Phil Furman described how over 140 phosphoramidate prodrugs of PSI-6206 were synthesised and how PSI-7977 was selected to become sofosbuvir (
