<p>PSI-6130 was highly selective for HCV versus other viruses, it was active 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against HCV polymerases from genotypes (GT) 1, 2, 3 and 4, was a non-obligate chain terminator of viral RNA and it had at least additive activity with other anti-HCV drugs. After passaging in cell culture for six months, a resistant mutant (S282T) was obtained but it was of low viral fitness and with no known pre-existing prevalence in the clinic. In rats and monkeys, the oral bioavailability was ∼ 20%. Of concern, there was deamination to give the uridine metabolite which was inactive against HCV. In monkeys, there was 40–70% conversion to the uridine metabolite.
