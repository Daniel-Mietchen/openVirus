<p>In a Phase I clinical study, PSI-6130 was well tolerated, there being no serious adverse events up to a dose of 9000 mg. The bioavailability was modest (∼ 25%) and, encouragingly, there was only 10% conversion to the inactive uridine metabolite. In collaboration with Roche, a prodrug approach was started with the aim to increase bioavailability and, if possible, decrease the conversion to the uridine metabolite. This programme led to RG7128. In a 14-day monotherapy Phase II study in HCV GT1 non-responder patients, there was a 2.7 log
 <sub>10</sub> reduction in HCV RNA levels. In a four-week combination study (RG7128 (1000 or 1500 mg bid) with pegylated IFN and RBV), there was ∼ 90% response rate with safety comparable to the corresponding placebo control. Certainly, this was an encouraging result but the high doses and the twice-daily dosing regimen were of concern which were unlikely to be overcome by the prodrug approach. So was there another option? Why was the uridine metabolite (PSI-6206) inactive? The Pharmasset team decided to try a different approach.
