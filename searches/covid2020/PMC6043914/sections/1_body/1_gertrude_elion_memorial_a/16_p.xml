<p>Using the HBV-infected chimeric mouse, the humanised liver supports the complete HBV life cycle. This model is proving useful to assess various combination of drugs. So far, the greatest reductions in serum HBsAg loads have been achieved by combining AB-423 + ARB-1740 + PegIFN. Slightly less reductions were obtained with AB-423 + ARB-1740 + entecavir. Neither of these regimens seemed to reduce the pre-established levels of cccDNA but both reduced the transcriptional activity of cccDNA. In human hepatocytes, AB-423 + ARB-1740 + PegIFN gave &gt;90% reduction of HBsAg levels which seemed to correlate with the best stimulation of human IFN-α levels.</p>
