<p>ARB-1467 is a combination of three siRNAs packaged in lipid nanoparticles. By targeting all four viral RNA transcripts, ARB-1467 inhibits the production of all four HBV antigens. In a mouse model, ARB-1467 gives a rapid reduction of HBV virions and antigens in both liver and blood samples. ARB-1740 has improved 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> potency and longer duration of activity relative to ARB-1467. ARB-1740 has modified oligonucleotide chemistry and changes in the HBV sites targeted. In a dose escalation Phase II trial, ARB-1467 doses increased from 0.2 mg/kg monthly to 0.4 mg/kg biweekly, with a possible extension up to a year based on the outcome after three months. In both HBeAg positive and negative patients, with the last dose (0.4 mg/kg) being on day 57, there was ∼0.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> reduction in HBsAg levels. Maybe, will ARB 1740 be more effective?
