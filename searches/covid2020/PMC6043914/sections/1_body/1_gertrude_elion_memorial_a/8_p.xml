<p>In cell cultures, PSI-6206 was not converted to the corresponding uridine monophosphate (PSI-6206-MP) but that human kinases were able to convert PSI-6206-MP to the di- and tri-phosphate (PSI-6206-TP). Both the cytidine and the uridine TPs inhibited the HCV polymerase but the uridine TP was the less potent as assessed by their inhibition constants (Ki), 0.42 and 0.06 µM, respectively. However, the half-life (T
 <sub>1/2</sub>) of PSI-6206-TP was much longer than that of PSI-6130-TP (38 and 5 h, respectively). The 38 h half-life would enable PSI-6206 to be administered once daily.
