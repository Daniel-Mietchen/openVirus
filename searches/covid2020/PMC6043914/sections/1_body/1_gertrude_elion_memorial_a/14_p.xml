<p>HBV replication is dependent on capsid assembly around pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) prior to synthesis of a partially double-stranded relaxed circular DNA genome and subsequent cccDNA synthesis. AB-423 inhibits HBV pgRNA encapsidation in a cell culture assay, maintains activity across genotypes Aâ€“D, against strains resistant to nucleoside/tide drugs and is highly selective for HBV versus other viruses. AB-423 also inhibits cccDNA synthesis, presumably by inhibiting the capsid uncoating process. There is at least additive activity in cell culture assays when combined with nucleoside/tide drugs and with ARB-1740 (see below). Similar results were obtained in a mouse model.</p>
