<p>In sofosbuvir Phase III studies, four separate trials recruited patients with different genotypes, 1 and 4, 2, 3 and 5 and 6, respectively. By this time, the SVR for 12 weeks (SVR
 <sub>12</sub>) had become the accepted measure for an HCV cure. The SVR
 <sub>12</sub> were 90, 97, 93 and 100%, respectively. To further optimise the cure rates, Gilead combined sofosbuvir with an NS5A inhibitor, ledipasvir, which became Harvoni®. However, ledipasvir has now been largely replaced by velpatasvir, another NS5A inhibitor but with an improved genetic barrier to resistance. This combination is Epclusa
 <sup>®</sup> which gives &gt;96% cure rate for all genotypes 1–6. Sofosbuvir-based cure regimens have been shown to be effective in patients co-infected with HIV, in previously difficult-to-treat patients – African Americans, in cirrhotic patients, in those with decompensated liver disease and in liver transplant patients. To date, there have been no cases of clinically observed viral resistance. [

  <sup>®</sup> (sofosbuvir–velpatasvir–voxilaprevir combination). I include further details within my conclusions
