<p>Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi
 <sup>®</sup>) received approval from the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2013. Since then, more than a million patients have been cured on sofosbuvir-based regimens. Although at least 15 nucleoside/tide drugs have entered clinical development, sofosbuvir remains the only approved nucleoside/tide drug for HCV therapy. It is the drug of choice to act as the ‘backbone’ of HCV combination therapies – only sofosbuvir has a sufficiently high genetic barrier to viral resistance combined with an excellent safety profile. HCV could become a rare disease if the issues regarding patient access can be resolved.
