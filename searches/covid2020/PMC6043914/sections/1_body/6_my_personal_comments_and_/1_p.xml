<p>Each year, ISAR presents three major awards, this year to Mike Sofia (Elion award), David Chu (Holý award) and Maaike Everts (Prusoff award). Also this year, the inaugural ISAR WIS award lecture was presented by Priscilla Yang – it is intended that this WIS award will become an annual event. For several years, ICAR has included at least one Keynote lecture, this year there were four. As these four are all leaders in their respective fields, I have introduced each with a short biography. All eight speakers gave excellent presentations, each on a different topic, each of such interest to me that I wanted to prepare a detailed account of their lectures. I could not have prepared this report without the active support of each of these presenters – I most gratefully thank them for their help. In this section, I express my personal opinions.</p>
