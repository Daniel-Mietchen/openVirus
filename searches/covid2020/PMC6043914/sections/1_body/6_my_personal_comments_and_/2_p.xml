<p>Although there are accounts of only eight lectures, these reflect the diversity that is characteristic of ICAR â€“ employment (academia, industry, public health), type of research (virus biology, potential antiviral targets, antiviral drugs, research organisation) and a range of viruses. For example, the viruses included were HCV and HBV (Mike Sofia), HIV and HBV (David Chu), multiple antiviral projects (Maaike Everts), dengue (Priscilla Yang), RV-C (Ann Palmenberg), polio (Mark Pallansch), HIV (Eric Hunter) and Zika virus (Pei-Yong Shi). The following comments give examples in which this diversity can bring benefits.</p>
