<p>Standard HBV therapy is with TAF, an excellent nucleotide-analogue drug which has a high genetic barrier to resistance. Although it limits HBV DNA effectively, it neither eliminates viral cccDNA nor the production of VPs transcribed from cccDNA. In this situation, compounds targeting VP production, and thereby allowing the restoration of the host immune response, require compounds with good activity and safety profile but not necessarily with a high genetic barrier because such compounds will always be used with TAF.</p>
