<p>I choose to end my comments with the Prusoff Award lecture by Maaike Everts because it illustrates the tremendous breadth of topics which have been presented at ICAR. ISAR was founded on the concept that successful antiviral research needs a multidimensional approach and every ICAR has promoted that aim. Maaike described the pros and cons of various collaborations involving different organisations. Her talk reminds me of the time when I started work at Beechams in 1969. Beechams had just switched from a Department system to Project-based format. I joined a newly formed multidisciplinary antiviral team. Many of us felt that the Project system worked well. I am interested in Maaikeâ€™s work helping to re-creating a Project system. She mentioned many of the pros and cons which we faced during my time at Beechams.</p>
