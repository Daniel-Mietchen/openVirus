<p>Priscilla Yang is investigating the potential of the entry viral glycoprotein (E), mediating attachment and membrane fusion, as a suitable antiviral target for drugs against dengue. It has been confirmed that small molecules can interact with E to give activity in both a target-based assay and a cell culture antiviral assay. The next step is to validate E as an antiviral target 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although it is necessary to confirm antiviral activity, it is also necessary to show that this approach can lead to antiviral compounds having a high genetic barrier to resistance. It was an encouraging start to find that some compounds did not show resistance up to passage 9. However, I think that Sophie Duraffour holds the record for ICAR’s longest resistance test, with resistance to (S)-HPMPDAP appearing in two strains of camelpox virus after passaging 30 times, taking 18 months, before resistant clones could be obtained. (Sophie Duraffour, 22nd ICAR, 3–7 May in Miami Beach, FL, USA). To investigate resistance to dengue, Priscilla’s group prepared various dengue mutant viruses containing point substitutions, which were chosen from naturally occurring E sequences identified in public databases. None of the current compounds were active against all these mutant strains. Surely, that suggests that, for these compounds, resistance will be a critical factor to be investigated.
