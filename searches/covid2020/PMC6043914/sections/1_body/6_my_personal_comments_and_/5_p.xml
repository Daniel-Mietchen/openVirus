<p>The next two decisions were also crucial. A prodrug approach improved bioavailability but did not enable once-daily dosing. Appreciating that an apparent problem (partial metabolism to an inactive compound) was a potential opportunity, it was decided to investigate the uridine analogue. This led to the testing of the cytosine and uridine triphosphate analogues versus the viral polymerase. Although the uridine analogue (PSI-6206-TP) was less potent than the cytidine analogue (PSI-6130-TP) as an inhibitor of the HCV polymerase, the half-life (T
 <sub>1/2</sub>) of PSI-6206-TP was much longer than that of PSI-6130-TP (38 and 5 h, respectively). The 38 h half-life would enable PSI-6206 to be administered once daily. The second crucial decision was to select the half-life as the more important parameter, the reduced activity as being of less importance. A prodrug approach was initiated to maximise activity, synthesising and evaluating many phosphoramidate prodrugs in order to select the best candidate drug. Each of these steps was important for the discovery of sofosbuvir which happened much earlier than expected.
