<p>I hope these comments help to illustrate the value of ICAR in bringing many different aspects of antiviral research together. I thank the ICAR Program committee, especially the co-chairs Mark Prichard and Justin Julander, for organising such a good conference. I am looking forward to the next ICAR at Porto, Portugal (11â€“15 June 2018).</p>
