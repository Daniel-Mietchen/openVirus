<p>Mike Sofia described his past work on sofosbuvir and his current work with HBV. His talk on sofosbuvir followed on from that of Phillip (Phil) Furman, the Elion Awardee at the 2015 ICAR. Both Phil and Mike worked at Pharmasset Inc. until it was bought by Gilead Inc. Then Mike continued at Gilead to assist in the development of sofosbuvir. The clinical introduction of sofosbuvir transformed the therapy of HCV, becoming the ‘backbone’ of various combination therapies. When so many firms were searching for anti-HCV drugs, what special factors enabled Pharmasset to discover such a uniquely active drug? My comments are based on both Phil’s and Mike’s lectures.</p>
