<p>Clearly, the continuing transmission of HIV is of great medical concern. Eric Hunter presented work providing insights into that transmission process. Although this work was done within the programme seeking an HIV vaccine, it also gives baseline data for preventing HIV transmission using drugs. The trial using Truvada (FTC/TDF) proved that preventing transmission was an achievable aim but that once-daily dosing was not an acceptable option for most of the trial participants.

If women can have a combined injection of EFdA/cabotegravir with their monthly contraceptive injection, preventing HIV transmission may become a practical reality, even in countries with limited medical resources.
