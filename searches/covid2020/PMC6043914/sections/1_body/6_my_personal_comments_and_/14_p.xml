<p>Mark Pallansch described the need for an effective anti-poliovirus compounds and to the ongoing work investigating resistance to pocapavir (V-073, capsid inhibitor, preventing viral RNA release) and V-7404 (3C PI). The greatest medical need is to treat those SCID patients in whom poliovirus infection has continued for many years. Experience with other long-lasting chronic infections indicates that drug therapy requires a combination of drugs, which includes at least one nucleoside/tide inhibitor with a high genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, it may be timely to prepare a ‘plan B’, approaching companies with a good panel of nucleoside/tide compounds.</p>
