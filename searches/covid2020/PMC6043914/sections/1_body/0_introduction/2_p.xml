<p>Because this review article simply provides accounts of oral presentations, it is not generally accompanied by references to the scientific literature. Any descriptions of favourable treatment outcomes should not be taken as a recommendation for clinical use. Generally, I have added my personal comments on the meeting within the conclusion. In a few instances, I have added my own comment within the main text, indicated either by the wording or by the use of italics within square brackets. Although this meeting report covers only eight of the presentations, the topics range greatly in diversity and illustrate how ICAR brings together knowledge and expertise from a wide spectrum of antiviral research.</p>
