<p>In conclusion, it has been confirmed that small molecules can interact with E to give activity in both a target-based assay and a cell culture antiviral assay. The antiviral activity may be extended to other flaviviruses. These inhibitors have been used to give more information about the fusion process and to develop a target-based assay currently being used to drive medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at generating compounds suitable for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> validation studies. Still to come, can E be validated as an antiviral target
