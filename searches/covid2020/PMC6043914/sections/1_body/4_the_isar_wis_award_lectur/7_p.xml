<p>The existing inhibitors have been used to develop a competitive amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay screen (ALPHAscreen), which was then used for a target-based screening campaign. From an initial screen of âˆ¼20,000 compounds, eight new scaffolds that inhibit dengue virus by binding to E and blocking fusion were discovered. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for inhibition of the ALPHAscreen assay were well correlated with EC
 <sub>90</sub> values for antiviral activity, validating the target-based assay.
