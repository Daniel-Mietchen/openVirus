<p>Our humoral immune response is usually effective in stopping an infection developing to clinical symptoms. The antibodies prevent viral entry into target cells, the earliest step in the viral life cycle. Could small molecules mimic this activity by binding to the viral glycoprotein? The flavivirus entry viral glycoprotein (E) has clear biochemical functions, mediating attachment and membrane fusion. Is it possible to validate E as a suitable antiviral target for drugs 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>? The laboratory has chosen to work with dengue virus because it is the most widespread mosquito-borne viral pathogen; it is closely related to West Nile, Zika and other pathogenic flaviviruses. The medical need is great, there being a vaccine with only modest activity and no approved drugs.
