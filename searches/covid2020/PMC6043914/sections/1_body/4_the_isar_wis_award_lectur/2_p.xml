<p>The underlying aim of Priscilla Yang (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-2040206618783924">Figure 7</xref>) and her laboratory is to use small molecules to inhibit or control protein function in order to probe virological processes and validate new antiviral targets. Using viral proteins (VPs) may open up new avenues for antiviral drug discovery. This presentation will focus on a specific target and why it was chosen. Along the way, that targetâ€™s biochemical and biological function may be better understood.
