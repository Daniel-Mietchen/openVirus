<p>The fusion inhibitors have also been used to define the stoichiometry for inhibiting E-mediated fusion of virus-like particles (VLPs) using a single-particle fusion assay. In this experimental model, VLPs with 120 copies of E (60 pre-fusion dimers) can be induced to fuse with a supported lipid bilayer upon exposure to acidic pH. Using a derivative of 3-110-22 modified with a fluorophore, binding of 10–12 copies of the inhibitor (∼10% of sites) was shown to be sufficient to prevent viral fusion.</p>
