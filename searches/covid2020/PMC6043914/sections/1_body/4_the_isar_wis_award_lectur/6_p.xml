<p>As there is considerable sequence similarity in the pocket region of E from dengue, Zika, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses, the compounds were tested for activity against these other viruses. Whereas compound 3-110-22 was equipotent against all four viruses, inhibitors of the both pyrimidine series appeared to be five- or more fold selective for dengue over other flaviviruses. This is consistent with the idea that 3-110-22 and other cyanohydrazones target the same pocket as the pyrimidines, but interact with the pocket in qualitatively different manner leading to different viral selectivities.</p>
