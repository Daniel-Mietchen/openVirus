<p>The objective of an iVDPV prevalence study was to assess the frequency of poliovirus excretion in patients with B cell immunity defects. Enrolment (n = 647) closed in November 2015, 636 stool samples were submitted and 635 laboratory results were obtained. Of the enrolled subjects, 19% were &lt;6 years old, 46% were 6–19 years and 35% were &gt;19 years. Most (51%) had CVID with other subjects having agammaglobulinaemia (39%), SCID (9%) or major histocompatibility complex Class II deficiency (1%); nearly all patients had treatment, either intravenous immunoglobulin (88%) or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (5%), just 7% having no treatment. Only 13/636 (2%) patients excreted poliovirus; of these, five were classified as iVDPV, all five being patients receiving treatment. As may be expected, the majority (four) of these patients had SCID. The majority of the 13 excretors, including 4/5 of iVDPV patients, had poliovirus type 2.</p>
