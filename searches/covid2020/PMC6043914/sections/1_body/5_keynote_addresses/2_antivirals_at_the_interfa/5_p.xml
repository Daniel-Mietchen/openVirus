<p>Since 1995, surveillance has been expanded to create a registry which includes all known iVDPV cases, initially mainly in well-resourced countries but increasingly now worldwide. Encouragingly, iVDPV shedders, not just those showing symptoms of paralysis, are being identified at a greater rate due to improved surveillance – in the period 2010–2016, over 50 cases were reported (cf. &lt;10 in 1980–1989). The majority of shedders are derived from the type 2 attenuated virus within the OPV, 67% only type 2 and 72% when including co-infection with either type 1 or 3.</p>
