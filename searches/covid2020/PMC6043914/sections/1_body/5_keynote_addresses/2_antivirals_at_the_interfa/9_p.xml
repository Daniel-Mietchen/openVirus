<p>The Polio Antivirals Initiative was set up with the aim to select promising candidate compounds and seek sponsors to progress these compounds. Just two compounds, pocapavir (V-073, capsid inhibitor, preventing viral RNA release) and V-7404 (3C protease inhibitor (PI)), have been identified as having the potential to be progressed quickly. Both these compounds have known cell culture activity against poliovirus, preclinical bioavailability and safety profile data.</p>
