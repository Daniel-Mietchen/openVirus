<p>To investigate this idea experimentally, at a median of 45 days after the estimated date of infection, the viral burden, levels of inflammatory cytokines, cellular immune activation and exhaustion and depletion of different CD4+ memory T cells were measured. It was shown that high vRC virus is linked to enhanced levels of inflammatory cytokines, driving T cell dysfunction and increased viral burden in na√Øve CD4+ T cells and CD4+ memory T cells. This finding is linked to significantly faster decline of CD4 cells. Therefore, what happens early in an infection can only be modulated by the adaptive immune system, reversal is not possible.</p>
