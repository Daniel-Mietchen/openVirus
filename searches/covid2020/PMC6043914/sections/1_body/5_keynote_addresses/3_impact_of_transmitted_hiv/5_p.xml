<p>Of all the viruses in the quasi-species present in the transmitting partner, there is a selection during transmission for virions that are closer to the consensus; this selection is statistically highly significant. Especially in men without ulcers, these virions are likely to represent some of the fitter viruses. The consequences of this virion selection have been followed in the newly infected partner for up to eight years with longitudinal CD4 and viral load (VL) following IAVI protocol C.</p>
