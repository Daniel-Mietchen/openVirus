<p>During the primary infection (about five weeks), the levels of HIV RNA rise rapidly(about 10
 <sup>7Â </sup>copies/ml plasma) at which time the anti-HIV cytotoxic T-lymphocytes appear and the HIV RNA levels start to decline to the set point VL. The transmitted variants with high vRC appear to initiate crucial events early in infection that dictate both the acute and chronic stages of the disease, regardless of the ability of the immune system to limit HIV RNA levels to the set point. It seems that irreversible damage is done very early in infection.
