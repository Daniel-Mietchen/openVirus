<p>Although there are no approved antiviral therapies for flaviviruses, there are some vaccines, for example, yellow fever virus vaccine. This suggests that a vaccine for Zika virus may be possible – certainly, the medical need is high. Generally, inactivated vaccines and subunit vaccines have a better safety profile than live attenuated vaccines. However, the later may give lifetime immunity after a single dose, a feature that Pei-Yong considered critical for a successful Zika vaccine. He has considered two possible approaches to produce an attenuated vaccine with a good safety profile; to knockout a key viral enzyme or to delete sections of the three prime untranslated region (3′UTR). His target enzyme was methyltransferase, which enables the Zika virus to acquire a cap to protect the viral RNA. The active site was inactivated by changing two amino acids. In the 3′UTR approach, he compared vaccines with 10-, 20- and two different 30-nucleotide deletions. Rather unexpectedly, the 10-nucleotide deletion (10-del ZIKV) seemed to be more attenuated than both a 20- or 30-nucleotide deletion vaccines. This may be due to the 10-del ZIKV being more susceptible to IFN than the other deletion vaccines – the reason for the differing IFN responses is not known. The 10-del ZIKA vaccine was the focus of the remainder of his ICAR presentation. The initial evaluation was done in a mouse model using type 1 IFN receptor-deficient A129 mice. To study the protective effect provided by vaccination in pregnant mice, C57BL/6 mice were used. Studies on male mice used A129 mice. Then safety and efficacy were confirmed in rhesus macaques.</p>
