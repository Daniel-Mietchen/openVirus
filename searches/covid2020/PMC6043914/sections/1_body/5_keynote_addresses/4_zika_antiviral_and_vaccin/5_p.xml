<p>After such an encouraging first result, further evaluation was continued. Having shown that the vaccine at a lower dose (100 PFU) was effective, it was tested at 10 PFU. In mice infected with wt virus, the viraemia was over 6 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/ml at day 4, reducing to about 4 on day 5 and about 2, near the limit of detection (LOD), on days 6 and 7. In the vaccinated mice, the viraemia was undetectable on day 4 but similar to the control group on days 5, 6 and 7. This low-dose vaccine group had similar antibody titres at day 28 and provided protection after virus challenge, there being no detectable viraemia.
