<p>When examining the structure of RV-C virions, about 70% of the particles contained RNA (full), the other particles being empty. This proportion is consistent for all serotypes and for virus obtained from cell cultures or clinical specimens. In contrast to RV-A and RV-B, both full and empty particles of RV-C had spikes formed by VP-1. The full and empty particles of RV-C are similar externally but the inclusion of RNA gives a more ordered structure internally. Antibodies to VP-1 are neutralising. RV-A and RV-B have a VP-1 pocket into which drugs, such as pleconaril, can bind, but this ‘pocket’ has collapsed in RV-C. However, RCV-C does have a glycan binding surface which is conserved among all 55 strains. Sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac) binds to this site.</p>
