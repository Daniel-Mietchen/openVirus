<p>To answer this question, a phylogenetic tree was created in collaboration with Nels Elde and Alesia McKeown (University of Utah) from many clinical samples, most of which were unpassaged clinical isolates of RVs, types A, B and C. Samples from all serotypes were represented. Preliminary information suggested an emergence of RV-C from the RV-A, about 3000–5000 years ago. Ann generously added interesting unpublished data which has led to a probable date for this divergence. The emergence of RV-C may explain why the Cys
 <sub>529</sub> protein has become so dominant in the modern human population but it does not account for the early appearance of this variant in ancient human DNA prior to ‘out of Africa’.
