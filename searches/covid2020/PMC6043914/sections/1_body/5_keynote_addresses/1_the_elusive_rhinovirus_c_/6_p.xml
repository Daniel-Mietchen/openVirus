<p>The normal role of cadherins is to hold cells together. They have a domain, which is anchored into the cell surface, and a long elongated part, which extends into the intercellular space and binds to the cadherins anchored to the neighbouring cells. Because cadherin-1 binds only with cadherin-1 and not to other variants, like cells bind to each other. CDHR3 has six extracellular domains, of which domains 1, 2 and 3 contain the RV-C contact sites.</p>
