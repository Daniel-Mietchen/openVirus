<p>Dating back to within the Neolithic (late stone age) period, a large DNA data set includes the genomes of 230 West Eurasians who lived between 6500 and 300 BC, including 163 with newly reported data.

 </sup> To the authors’ knowledge, the new samples included the first genome-wide ancient DNA (∼8500–3000 years before present) from Anatolian Neolithic farmers, who became Europe’s first farmers. [
 <italic>Anatolia corresponds to that part of modern Turkey east of the Bosphorus and bordered by the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean to the south.</italic>] Within that Anatolian population, 25% had the Cys
 <sub>529</sub> variant and 75% had the Tyr
 <sub>529</sub> form. In samples from central Europe dating about 1000 years before present, the proportions had reversed (85 and 15%, respectively). In modern times, the majority of humans have both genes for the Cys
 <sub>529</sub> protein, ranging from 53% in Africa to 87% in Asia, with the Americas (75%) and Europe (68%) having intermediate values. Could it be that RV-C had evolved and was putting pressure on human evolution?
