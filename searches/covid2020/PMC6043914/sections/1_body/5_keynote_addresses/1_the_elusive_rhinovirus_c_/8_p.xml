<p>The CDHR3 Tyr
 <sub>529</sub> is the ancestral protein. Although a few mammals (e.g. horse and mouse) have CDHR3 His
 <sub>529</sub>, most mammals, and even some birds and reptiles, have Tyr
 <sub>529</sub>. All non-human primates are Tyr
 <sub>529</sub>. The early humans, Neanderthal and Denisovan, are thought to have diverged from the modern human lineage about 300,000 years ago. It is a remarkable achievement of recent scientific discovery that their DNA sequence is now known – they have the ancestral Tyr
 <sub>529</sub> protein. In contrast, the Cys
 <sub>529</sub> protein appears to be unique to our human race. However, the Cys
 <sub>529</sub> variant first appeared in modern humans a long time ago, being detected in some ancient modern human remains which were discovered in Africa. The dates showed that Cys
 <sub>529</sub> was already present within the human population before the ‘out of Africa’ event, around 50,000 years ago.

 <sub>529</sub> protein.
