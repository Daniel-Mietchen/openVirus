<p>Following the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was shown to be caused by a coronavirus and is now known as SARS-CoV, the SARS surveillance programme monitored the viral RNA sequences in clinical samples. Unexpectedly in 2006, a newly discovered viral RNA sequence seemed to be a third type of RV, designated RV-C. Initially, RV-C could not be replicated in cell cultures, thus giving an explanation for it remaining ‘hidden’ for five decades. When growth in culture was achieved, it was shown that, unlike RV-A and RV-B, it uses the cellular receptor, cadherin-related protein 3 (CDHR3). Just as there are many serotypes of RV-A (78) and RV-B (30), there are 55 serotypes of RV-C. Since 2006, RV-C has been shown to be the primary cause of asthma exacerbations and viral pneumonia in infants. In a clinical study, RV-C was detected in 60% of children with asthma exacerbations versus 24% with either RV-A or RV-B, 14% with another virus without RV and 8% with no virus detected. RV-C was associated with children who had more severe asthma.</p>
