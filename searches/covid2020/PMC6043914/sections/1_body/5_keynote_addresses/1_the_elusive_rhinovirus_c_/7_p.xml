<p>In 2014, CDHR3 was reported to be an important susceptibility gene for asthma exacerbations, which are one of the most frequent causes of hospitalisation during childhood.

 </sup> Although CDHR3 is highly expressed in airway epithelium, there is another important factor. In modern humans, there are two forms of CDHR3, Tyr
 <sub>529</sub> and Cys
 <sub>529</sub> (CDHR3 Y
 <sub>529</sub> and CDHR3 C
 <sub>529</sub>, respectively). Those children, who have Tyr
 <sub>529</sub> encoded in the corresponding genes from both parents (homozygous for Tyr
 <sub>529</sub>), have 5â€“10-fold higher risk for asthma exacerbations and hospitalisation than those with only Cys
 <sub>529</sub> (homozygous for Cys
 <sub>529</sub>). Children with genes encoding Tyr/Cys CDHR3 had intermediate risk. In this study, the proportions of patients with asthma were 67, 3 and 29%, respectively.
