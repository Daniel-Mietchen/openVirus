<p>In 2009, Maaike was recruited to act as a co-ordinator, helping to build multidisciplinary projects. To date, more than 30 projects have been initiated, of these, 15 have been closed due to the chance of success being assessed as low. Such closures have been done in a considered, respectful way. More than 20 projects are still ongoing.</p>
