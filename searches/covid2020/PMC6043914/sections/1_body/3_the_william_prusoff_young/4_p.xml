<p>The ADDA has two participants, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and Southern Research (SR). It was Richard (Rich) Whitley and John (Jack) Secrist who initiated (2008) this collaboration. (Both were Past Presidents of ICAR and regular ICAR attendees â€“ was that a factor?) UAB identified the targets, SR did the high throughput screening (HTS) and medicinal chemistry, both UAB and SR evaluated leads through cell culture and animal studies, with UAB progressing clinical trials. Intellectual property (IP) was jointly owned.</p>
