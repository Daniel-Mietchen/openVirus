<p>In collaboration with Mike Sofia (this ICARâ€™s Elion awardee), FMCA-P was tested in an immunodeficient mouse model of HBV. Entecavir was the positive control. The drugs were administered by hydrodynamic injection (this technique enables larger injection volumes to be administered via the tail vein; prior to injection, the mice are placed in a warm box to enlarge the tail vein). David kindly shared some unpublished, preliminary results; FMCA-P had sufficient activity to encourage further work.</p>
