<p>The final section of David’s lecture described the investigation of a new carbocyclic nucleoside, 2′-Deoxy-2′-fluoro-3′-hydroxy-4′-(hydroxymethyl)-5′-methylene-carbocyclic adenosine (FMCA) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2040206618783924">Figure 5</xref>). The 14-step synthesis was shown. FMCA was tested in a cell culture HBV DNA replication assay against both wild-type (wt), lamivudine-resistant strains (M204V, M204I, L180M and L180M/M204V) and adefovir-resistant strain (M236T). FMCA, retained good activity against all these strains, the change in EC
 <sub>50</sub> values versus the wt virus was between 1.0- and 1.2-fold. In a separate cell culture assay, FMCA and its phosphoramidate prodrug (FMCA-P) were tested against an entecavir-resistant strain (L180M/M204V/S202G). Both FMCA and its prodrug retained good activity (1.2- and 0.9-fold). Although the data were not shown, FMCA also retains activity against tenofovir-resistant strains.
