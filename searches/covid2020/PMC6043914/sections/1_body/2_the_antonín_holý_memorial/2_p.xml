 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2040206618783924">Figure 4</xref>) had known Antonín (Tony) Holý, meeting him at ICAR over many years. David commented that Tony’s work continues to touch the lives of millions of people. In his introduction, David said that he would briefly summarise work on HIV and VZV, then switch focus to HBV. Multistep enantiomeric syntheses were devised for 
 <sc>d</sc>- and 
 <sc>l</sc>-1,3-dioxolane nucleosides, starting from 
 <sc>d</sc>-mannose and 
 <sc>l</sc>-glucose, respectively. The 
 <sc>d</sc>-dioxolanes led to two compounds (DAPD and DOT) with activity against HIV and the 
 <sc>l</sc>-dioxolanes included a compound (
 <sc>l</sc>-BHDU) active against herpesviruses.
