<p>Amdoxovir (DAPD, (−)-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-2,6-diaminopurine-dioxolane) had activity against both HIV and HBV. DAPD is converted by adenosine deaminase to the corresponding guanosine anaologue, DXG. At that time (late 1990s), AZT- and 3TC-resistant strains of HIV were limiting the effectiveness of therapy. In cell culture assays using resistant clinical strains, DXG retained good activity, there being only a 2.3-fold decrease with the double AZT/3TC-resistant mutations (67N/70R/184V/215Y/219E). DAPD was progressed to Phase IIa trials in HIV patients. DAPD (500 mg twice daily for two weeks) gave modest activity as monotherapy but, when added to current therapy, there was about 2 log
 <sub>10</sub> reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels.
