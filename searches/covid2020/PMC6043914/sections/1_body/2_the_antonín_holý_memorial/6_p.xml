<p>The focus of David’s lecture then switched to HBV. David commented that two nucleotide analogues, used widely for HBV therapy, came from Tony Holý – adefovir and tenofovir. Initially, lamivudine was approved for HBV therapy but viral resistance became a major problem, about two-thirds of the patients having resistant virus after four years of treatment. With adefovir, the resistance was much less, at about 30% after five years but a better treatment was needed. With entecavir and tenofovir, the resistance levels remain very low, just a handful of patients having resistant virus. Recently, tenofovir alafenamide (a new prodrug) has been approved – the efficacy is comparable to that with tenofovir but the safety profile is significantly improved.</p>
