<p>Interest in 1-(Î²-
 <sc>d</sc>-dioxolane)thymine (DOT) was stimulated when it was discovered that it retained its anti-HIV activity when tested using resistant strains. David showed the nine-step synthesis of DOT, starting from 1,6-anhydro-
 <sc>d</sc>-mannose, reported in 1991. The resistance profile for DOT was done in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using cloned HIV with known resistance mutations. Against AZT, 3TC and AZT/3TC mutants, DOT retained full activity, even a marginal trend to being more active. Of particular note, DOT was active against the AZT-resistant strain with four mutations (K67N, K70R, T215Y, K219Q), (1.1-fold increase in EC
 <sub>50</sub>), and against tenofovir-resistant strain (K65R) (0.5-fold). Although the active moiety, DOT-triphosphate was prepared to investigate its interaction with HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), DOT was not progressed to clinical trials.
