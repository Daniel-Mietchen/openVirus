<p>In collaboration with Jennifer Moffat, who was also attending this ICAR, 
 <sc>l</sc>-BHDU (β-
 <sc>l</sc>-1-(E-2-bromovinyl)-2-1,3-(dioxolan-4-yl)uracil) was discovered to be active against varicella zoster virus (VZV, chickenpox/shingles) both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although with slightly less activity, 
 <sc>l</sc>-BHDU inhibited two other herpesviruses, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV, glandular fever/infectious mononucleosis) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (cold sores). Against these herpesviruses, 
 <sc>l</sc>-BHDU was more active than the positive control, ACV. In contrast to the known anti-VZV compound, bromovinyl-deoxyuridine (BVdU), 
 <sc>l</sc>-BHDU does not interfere with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolism. This became an important toxicity issue when BVdU and 5-FU were co-administered to cancer patients. In a VZV animal model, 
 <sc>l</sc>-BHDU (150 mg/kg) was markedly more effective than valacyclovir (200 mg/kg).
