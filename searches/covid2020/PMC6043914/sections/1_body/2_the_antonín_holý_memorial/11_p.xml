<p>In summary, FMCA and its phosphoramidate prodrug, FMCA-P, were fully active against HBV strains resistant to lamivudine, entecavir, adefovir and tenofovir. FMCA appears to have a good safety profile, having minimal inhibitory effects on cellular and mitochondrial DNA replication. Compared to entecavir, the good safety profile enables higher doses of FMCA-P to be used in efficacy studies using a mouse model. Further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of FMCA-P is ongoing. Although pre-existing HBV cccDNA is not eliminated by therapy with nucleoside/tide analogues, such drugs will play a vital role in controlling HBV replication while minimising drug resistance.
