<p>In a Phase II/III trial clevudine was dosed (30 mg once daily) for 24 weeks. In HBeAg(+) (hepatitis B antigen positive) patients, HBV DNA levels continued to decrease during the dosing period to 5.1 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml below baseline. During the 24 weeks after dosing, HBV DNA levels rose slowly but were still 2 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml below baseline. In HBeAg(−) patients, the decrease in HVB DNA levels was similar (4.25 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml) but then rose very slowly to 3.1 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml below baseline at 24 weeks after dosing. Presently, clevudine is marketed by EISAI (Japan) in South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines. NDAs (new drug applications) have been filed in various other Asian countries. In the USA, Phase III trials were discontinued by Pharmasset.
