<p>As described above, asthma is typically characterized by chronic allergic inflammatory airway inflammation associated with airway hyperresponsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of bronchial obstruction. In contrast, COPD is characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and ultimately results in respiratory failure. Therefore, it is not difficult to differentiate clinically between the two disorders. However, determining whether a patient has asthma or an exacerbation of COPD is often difficult, because of their clinical similarity. The
