<p>Recent understanding of the innate immune system suggests that it may function independently of the adaptive immune system in some cases or synergistically in others, and the relative contributions of the two systems may explain the disease heterogeneity among asthmatic patients, which might occur in patients with COPD (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Holtzman, 2012</xref>). It has long been argued that asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema could be considered as different expressions of one disease entity. This view is called the “Dutch hypothesis” (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Kraft, 2006</xref>), and it is still under debate, with no consensus about it. There are many similarities in asthma and COPD (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Bleecker, 2004</xref>), and previous studies suggested that asthma may be a risk factor for the development of COPD (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">Silva et al., 2004</xref>), while the coexistence of asthma and COPD, so-called “overlap syndrome,” has recently been attracting attention. Overlap syndrome accounts for about 15–25% of obstructive airway disease (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Louie et al., 2013</xref>) and shows more frequent or severe exacerbations and higher mortality than COPD alone (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Hardin et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, previous reports noted that exacerbations of asthma or COPD are associated with accelerated loss of lung function and quality of life and increased healthcare costs and mortality.
