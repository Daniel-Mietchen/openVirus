<p>It has been reported that exacerbations are predominantly caused by bacterial and viral respiratory infections (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
 </bold>), and air pollution has a minor contribution. Previous studies showed that bacteria (
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis, </italic>and
 <italic> P. aeruginosa</italic>) and respiratory viruses (HRV, RSV, influenza virus, HMPV, coronavirus, and AdVs) were recognized during exacerbations. Bacteria, such as 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were also detected in stable patients (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">Sethi and Murphy, 2008</xref>). When strains of bacteria are changed among the same species or there is emergence of other bacteria, this might cause inflammation in the lung in COPD patients and result in exacerbation (

 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>, in exacerbations of COPD is poorly recognized (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Perotin et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Blasi et al. (2002)</xref> showed that 
 <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> may be associated with exacerbation of COPD. Viruses such as HRV, RSV, and influenza virus have a higher prevalence in patients with exacerbations of COPD than in stable patients (
