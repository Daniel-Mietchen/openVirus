<p>Inhaled bronchodilators, LAMA and LABA, are the main pharmacological therapies in stable COPD patients (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">Vogelmeier et al. (2011)</xref> reported that the tiotropium (LAMA)-treated group had a lower exacerbation rate than the salmeterol (LABA)-treated group in their head-to-head study, both LAMA and LABA treatments decreased exacerbation rates and improved lung function or health-related quality of life. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">Tashkin et al. (2009)</xref> found that combination LAMA/LABA therapy improved pulmonary function (FEV
 <sub>1.0</sub>) and respiratory symptoms better than LAMA therapy alone. ICS, the main treatment for asthma, is also prescribed in COPD patients and may reduce airway inflammation and decrease exacerbation rates only in moderate and severe COPD patients (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Calverley et al., 2007</xref>). Treatment with macrolide antibiotics has been reported to prevent COPD exacerbations and improve patient quality of life and symptoms, especially in patients who have frequent exacerbations (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Albert et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">Yamaya et al., 2012a</xref>), although this intervention could lead to unfavorable events such as increasing the prevalence of macrolide-resistant pathogens or cardiac toxicity.
