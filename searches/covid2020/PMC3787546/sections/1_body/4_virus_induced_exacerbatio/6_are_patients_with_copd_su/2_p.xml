 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Mallia et al. (2011</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2012)</xref> confirmed these findings in a human experimental study; they found no significant differences in the frequencies of successful HRV infection between COPD and control groups when these groups were experimentally inoculated with HRV. Respiratory symptoms and a decline in lung function were more severe in the COPD group than in the control group.
