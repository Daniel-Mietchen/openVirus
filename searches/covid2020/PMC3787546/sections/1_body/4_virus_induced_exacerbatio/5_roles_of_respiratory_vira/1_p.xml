<p>A few decades ago, it was considered that the role of respiratory viral infections was not a major cause in exacerbations of COPD because of the low sensitivity for viral detection, which depended on conventional technical methods such as viral culture or serological tests. However, recent studies have used new diagnostic technologies such as PCR or RT-PCR methods, which have a higher sensitivity for viral detection than conventional methods. Viral detections accounted for 22–57% of exacerbations of COPD in recent studies (
