(2011)</xref> reported that experimental HRV infection showed more severe and prolonged lower respiratory symptoms, airway obstruction, and neutrophilic airway inflammation in COPD patients than in control subjects. They stated that rhinovirus infection led to elevation of neutrophil elastase, which is associated with reduction of antimicrobial peptides, such as secretory leukoprotease inhibitor and elafin. This reduction of antimicrobial peptides predisposes to secondary bacterial infection (
