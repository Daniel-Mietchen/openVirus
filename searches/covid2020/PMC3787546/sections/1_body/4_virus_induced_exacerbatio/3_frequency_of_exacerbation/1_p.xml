<p>Previous studies showed that the annual rate of event-based exacerbations of COPD was 0.85â€“1.30 per patient per year (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Hurst et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the rate of exacerbation seems to depend on the disease severity (GOLD stage). However, it is particularly worth noting that the ECLIPSE study showed a subgroup of COPD patients that appeared to be susceptible to exacerbations, irrespective of GOLD stage. Other factors for exacerbations were several environmental factors, such as seasons or inhalation of harmful substances, and epidemic peaks in exacerbations of COPD were noted in both late fall and winter in the same fashion as in adult asthma (
