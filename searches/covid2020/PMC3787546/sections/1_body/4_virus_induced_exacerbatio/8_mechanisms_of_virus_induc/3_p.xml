<p>Inflammatory cytokines in sputum during exacerbations have been found to be elevated regardless of whether the infection is viral or bacterial (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aaron et al., 2001</xref>), and their levels were higher with exacerbations than when stable. Eosinophils are considered characteristic cells in asthma, but they are also detected with exacerbations of COPD (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">Saetta et al., 1994</xref>). Indeed, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Papi et al. (2006)</xref> demonstrated that virus-associated exacerbations in COPD patients were related to increased eosinophil counts and the level of eosinophil cationic protein. Furthermore, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bafadhel et al. (2011)</xref> showed that serum C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) is implicated as a more potent predictive maker for virus-associated exacerbations, and it is known as IFN-Î»-induced protein 10.
