<p>In bronchial asthma, acute exacerbation involves several issues (

 </bold>), such as the definition of acute exacerbation of asthma, recognition of the clinical symptoms of respiratory tract infection (RTI), assessment of the risk factors for acute exacerbation, considering the possibility of other diseases (differential diagnosis), diagnostic methods, appropriate sample collection, and treatment or prevention. An older study showed that asthmatic patients had a 6.2 times greater chance of having viral RTIs than a control group (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Corne et al. (2002)</xref> found that the detection rates of human rhinovirus (HRV) in asthmatic (10.1%) and healthy participants (8.5%) were similar. The term virus-induced exacerbation of asthma is not uncommon, but only a small number of such studies were prospective (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Johnston et al., 1995</xref>). Furthermore, RTIs do not always lead to an exacerbation, and there is little evidence that treating or preventing the infection may cure or prevent an exacerbation. In this regard, we mainly discuss the details of “viral infection and exacerbation of asthma,” focusing on the accumulation of useful expertise for understanding this unfavorable condition in adult asthmatic patients.
