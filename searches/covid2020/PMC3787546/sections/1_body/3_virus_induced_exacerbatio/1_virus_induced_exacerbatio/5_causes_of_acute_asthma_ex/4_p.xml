 </italic>. Recent studies have identified infection with HRV as a predominant respiratory pathogen associated with asthma later in life (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Kusel et al., 2007</xref>). HRV is the most important virus type associated with exacerbations of asthma leading to hospital admission in both adults and children (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Johnston et al., 1996</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">Tan et al. (2003)</xref> reported that picornaviruses (rhinovirus/enterovirus) and AdV were most commonly identified in near-fatal asthma, whereas influenza virus predominated in COPD. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Corne et al. (2002)</xref> found that the detection rates of HRV in asthmatic (10.1%) and healthy participants (8.5%) were similar, but the LRT symptoms were significantly more severe and longer-lasting in the asthmatic group than in the healthy group. Thus, HRV is the most common and important cause of exacerbation in both children and adults (
