 </bold>). The role of severe RSV infection as a risk factor for asthma in adulthood is less certain, but it is still under study. RSV is an important pathogen of young children and accounts for ~70% of severe infantile viral bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia cases, most of whom have wheezing, and it is the most common cause of hospital admission in the winter season during the first year of life (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Blanken et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, this study showed the strongest evidence that human RSV-mediated bronchiolitis has long-term effects using palivizumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody against RSV F protein that prevents infection by RSV in infancy). In children under 5 years, RSV and PIV are the most common pathogens, whereas in older children, rhinovirus and influenza A virus are more prevalent (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Beasley et al., 1988</xref>). Even in elderly persons, RSV causes pneumonia (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Falsey et al., 2006</xref>), exacerbations of COPD, and acute deterioration in those with cardiac disease, and it contributes substantially to excess deaths in the winter season (
