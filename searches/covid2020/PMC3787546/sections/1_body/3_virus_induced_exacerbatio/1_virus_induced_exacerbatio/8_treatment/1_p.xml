<p>The term “virus-induced exacerbation” is not uncommon, but only a small number of prospective studies have been conducted so far (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Nicholson et al., 1993</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Johnston et al., 1995</xref>). Importantly, respiratory infections do not always result in an exacerbation, and there is little evidence that treating or preventing the infection may cure or prevent an exacerbation (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">Xepapadaki and Papadopoulos, 2010</xref>). However, another study found that URT infections were strongly associated with exacerbations of asthma leading to hospital admission, in both adults and children (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Johnston et al., 1996</xref>), and they may have contributed to asthma mortality, especially in the setting of hospital admission. Specific anti-viral therapies have not been established except for influenza viral infection, which have been recommended for persons with asthma or COPD. Furthermore, regarding preventive therapy for RSV, palivizumab as described above is now commercially available, and it might be appropriate for infants and young children with congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and prematurity before 35 weeks of gestation (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Dawson-Caswell and Muncie, 2011</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Blanken et al. (2013)</xref> stated that palivizumab treatment in healthy preterm infants born at a gestational age of 33–35 weeks reduced the number of wheezing days during the first year of life.
