<p>In general, upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms include rhinorrhea, sneezing, blocked nose, sore throat, hoarse voice, head or face ache, chill, and fever, while LRT symptoms include symptoms such as wheeze, cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">Tan et al. (2003)</xref> reported that virus-positive patients had a significantly increased frequency of URT symptoms of rhinorrhea, sore throat, fever, chills, and malaise. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Nicholson et al. (1993)</xref> reported that, in adults with asthma, about a quarter of laboratory-confirmed viral and chlamydial acute upper respiratory infections was associated with mean decreases in peak expiratory flow of &gt; 50 L/min, and half was associated with mean decreases of &gt;25 L/min. The report also noted that respiratory pathogens were implicated in almost half of the most severe asthma exacerbations with a &gt; 50 L/min mean decrease in peak expiratory flow. Viral infections have been shown to enhance both the reactivity of the lower airway and the magnitude of bronchoconstriction in response to inhaled contractile substances in asthma. The latter effect can persist for several weeks after infection, presenting as LRT symptoms (
