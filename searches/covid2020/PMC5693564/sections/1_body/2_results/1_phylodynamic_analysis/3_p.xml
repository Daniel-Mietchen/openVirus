<p id="Par33">Due to possibilities of recombinant MERS-CoV strains, aligned sequences were tested for recombination via RDP4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Sequences 441SA15 and 451SA15 had similarities to two different strains, 470SA15 and 355SA13 and were removed from the dataset since recombinant strains could convolute the evolutionary analysis (results shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1).
