<p id="Par35">Temporal signal of the sequences was also investigated. Temporal signal refers to how much genetic change has taken place between sampling times which is especially important in this case since samples were collected over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In order to make molecular clock inferences, genetic distances on phylogenetic trees have to be translated into temporal distances. Root-to-tip divergence plots are shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3a, b and c; no major deviations from the regression line were observed indicating that the genetic divergence of the sequence more or less align with what is expected given the sequence sampling date. The regression plots for the main dataset and the human subset had R
 <sup>2</sup> values of 0.75 and 0.63, respectively, indicating a strong association while the camel subset had R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.42 which was weaker but still positive.
