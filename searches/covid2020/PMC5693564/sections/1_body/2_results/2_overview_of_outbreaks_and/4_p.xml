<p id="Par40">A major outbreak at several hospitals in the Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia occurred around April 2013 where epidemiological investigation linked 23 MERS cases to dialysis and intensive care units [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. These are indicated in orange near the middle of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). From June to August of the same year, there was a community outbreak in Hafr al-Batin where 12 patients were infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Although there was a transmission to a healthcare worker, the rest of the patients in this cluster were presumed to have gathered for the large, regional camel market, and therefore, both zoonotic and human-to-human transmissions may have occurred simultaneously. Interestingly, both the Al-Hasa and Hafr-al-Batin outbreaks cluster with sequences from Riyadh, which may indicate travel of persons, and possibly MERS-CoV with them, to and from this capital city.
