<p id="Par44">A wide range of basic reproduction numbers (R
 <sub>0</sub>) from 0.32 to 1.3, has been reported for MERS and are summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Most researchers agree that MERS has a low potential to become a pandemic at this point in time, but once the CoV is introduced in a nosocomial setting, the R
 <sub>0</sub> can range from 2 to 6.7 and even from 7 to 19.3 [
