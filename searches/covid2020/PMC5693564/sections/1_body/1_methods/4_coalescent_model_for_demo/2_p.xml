<p id="Par27">Best fitting model was chosen by comparing the Bayes Factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. If log (Bayes Factor) was &gt;1 and &lt;3, there was weak evidence against the model with lower marginal likelihood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Higher log values indicated stronger evidence, such that values greater than 3 and 5 were considered to give strong and very strong evidence, respectively.
