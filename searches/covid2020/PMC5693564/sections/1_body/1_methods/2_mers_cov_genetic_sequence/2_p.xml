<p id="Par22">The sequences were aligned using Clustal X and manually edited using BioEdit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Then the best fitting nucleotide substitution model was chosen via hierarchical likelihood ratio test with ModelTest implemented in PAUP*4.0 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].
