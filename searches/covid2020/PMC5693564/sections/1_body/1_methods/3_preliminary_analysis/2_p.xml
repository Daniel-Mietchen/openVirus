<p id="Par24">Second phylogenetic signals in the datasets were investigated with TREE-PUZZLE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It reported maximum likelihood for each new tree generated as a single dot on a triangle. The distribution of these dots among the seven zones of the triangle indicated their phylogenetic signals: if a dot was located in the central triangle, its tree had unresolved phylogeny with star-like structure. If a dot was located in the sides of the triangle, the phylogeny was network like and only partially resolved. Lastly, if the dot was positioned in one of the three corners, the tree topology was considered fully resolved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].
