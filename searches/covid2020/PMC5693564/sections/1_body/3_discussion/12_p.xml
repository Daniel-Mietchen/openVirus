<p id="Par59">We attempted to estimate the basic reproduction number via Bayesian analysis but the mixing of human and camel sequences with multiple introductions of MERS-CoV from animals to humans was not possible to model. However, from the literature review, many researchers seem to have reached consistent conclusion that the R
 <sub>0</sub> is less than 1 even in endemic countries; notable deviations arose only when MERS-CoV was introduced to a hospital setting then R
 <sub>0</sub> increased by folds. Superspreading has been cited to be responsible for this trend since the exponential number of transmissions by a few can raise the R
 <sub>0</sub> [
