  <p>Influenza nucleoprotein release from the virus in response to increasing concentrations of CPC was measured by ELISA. Exposure to CPC concentrations above 7.5 μg/mL produced significant elevations in nucleoprotein release compared to control, n = 8 experimental replicates, shown as mean ± SD. Mean influenza nucleoprotein levels in the presence of CPC were compared to control (0 μg/mL) using independent samples 
   <italic>t</italic> test (IBM SPSS ver 24, IBM Corp).
