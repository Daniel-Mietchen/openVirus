  <p>Exposure of influenza to 3 sub-inhibitory concentrations of CPC for 10 passages shows an absence of resistance to CPC. Influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) and Influenza B strains were continuously grown in 3 sub-inhibitory concentrations of CPC: 0.2, 0.02, and 0.002 μg/mL. Viral titer was determined at the end of each passage by hemagglutination assay to ensure an adequate inoculation for each subsequent passage. Ten passages, with 3–4 days exposure per passage, of each influenza strain were performed for all concentrations of CPC. The EC
   <sub>50</sub> was then determined for each virus at the 10th passage and compared to the original strain (baseline control). No development of resistance to CPC (defined as over 2-fold change in EC
   <sub>50</sub>) was seen in any strain of influenza at any tested concentration of CPC, n = 3 experimental replicates, shown as mean ± SD.
