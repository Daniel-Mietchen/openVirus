  <p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrating CPC disrupts the integrity of the viral envelope and morphology of influenza virus. (A) Untreated influenza virus, (B, C) influenza virus treated with 50 Î¼g/mL CPC for 5 minutes. Viral particles exposed to CPC demonstrate disrupted envelope or cavitation (arrows) of viral units. The presence of negative stain inside the virions indicates membrane permeabilization. The scale bar is in the lower left corner at 100 nm (A) or 50 nm (B, C). We quantified the number of intact and disrupted viruses after treatment, and found that in CPC-treated samples, 86% (172/200) of the viruses were disrupted while in untreated samples only 4.5% (9/200) were disrupted.</p>
