         <p>There is a continued need for strategies to prevent influenza. While cetylpyridinium
            chloride (CPC), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, has an extensive antimicrobial
            spectrum, its ability to affect respiratory viruses has not been studied in detail.

         <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Objectives:</div>
         <p>Here, we evaluate the ability of CPC to disrupt influenza viruses 
            
            <i>in vitro</i> and 
            
            <i>in vivo</i>.

         <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Methods:</div>
         <p>The virucidal activity of CPC was evaluated against susceptible and oseltamivir- resistant
            strains of influenza viruses. The effective virucidal concentration (EC) of CPC was
            determined using a hemagglutination assay and tissue culture infective dose assay.
            The effect of CPC on viral envelope morphology and ultrastructure was evaluated using
            transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The ability of influenza virus to develop
            resistance was evaluated after multiple passaging in sub-inhibitory concentrations
            of CPC. Finally, the efficacy of CPC in formulation to prevent and treat influenza
            infection was evaluated using the PR8 murine influenza model.

         <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Results:</div>
         <p>The virucidal effect of CPC occurred within 10 minutes, with mean EC
            
            <sub>50</sub> and EC
            
            <sub>2log</sub> ranging between 5 to 20 Î¼g/mL, for most strains of influenza tested regardless of
            type and resistance to oseltamivir. Examinations using TEM showed that CPC disrupted
            the integrity of the viral envelope and its morphology. Influenza viruses demonstrated
            no resistance to CPC despite prolonged exposure. Treated mice exhibited significantly
            increased survival and maintained body weight compared to untreated mice.

         <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">Conclusions:</div>
         <p>The antimicrobial agent CPC possesses virucidal activity against susceptible and resistant
            strains of influenza virus by targeting and disrupting the viral envelope. Substantial
            virucidal activity is seen even at very low concentrations of CPC without development
            of resistance. Moreover, CPC in formulation reduces influenza-associated mortality
            and morbidity
