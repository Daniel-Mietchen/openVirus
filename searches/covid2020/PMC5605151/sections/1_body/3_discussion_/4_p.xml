<p>The ability of CPC to perturb viral envelopes allows for a broad spectrum of activity. However, historical concerns over the toxicity of CPC may have resulted in it being underused clinically. In our study, the therapeutic index (EC
 <sub>50</sub>/CC
 <sub>50</sub>) of CPC was between 7.7 and 19.2, within the range for consideration of drug development. However, it is important to note that MDCK cells are quite robust; further cytotoxicity testing of CPC in human-derived cells, such as A549 cells, may add to our understanding of potential toxicity. We expect that longer exposure may also portend increased toxicity. Importantly, CPC has been deemed safe for human use when applied at concentrations up to 1000 Î¼g/mL [

These studies were conducted in a wide array of animal models (mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits, cats, and dogs) and humans demonstrating that CPC is safe for human use at the doses used in this study, including the 0.1% w/v clinical formulation. Lastly, a randomized double-blind clinical trial demonstrated that the CPC formulation (ARMS-I) was safe, well tolerated, and had a high acceptability with a protective signal [
