<p>Our TEM and nucleoprotein release studies showed that CPC disrupts the viral envelope. Although these experiments were performed using influenza B as a prototype virus, we expect the results to be similar with influenza A. This observation is in agreement with the known mechanism of action of CPC. Importantly, it is likely that CPC would also have substantial activity against other enveloped viruses such as RSV, parainfluenza, and coronavirus. The common annual epidemic of these viral pathogens in addition to influenza highlight the unmet need for broad anti-virals. The potential activity of CPC against non-enveloped pathogens including rhinovirus, bocavirus, or adenovirus remains unclear. However, since CPC has been shown to cause structural damage in non-enveloped bacteriophage [
