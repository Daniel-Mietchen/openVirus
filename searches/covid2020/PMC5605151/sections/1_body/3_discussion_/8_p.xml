<p>Lastly, we demonstrated protection conferred by the CPC-based ARMS-1 clinical formulation in a mouse model of influenza. Often, drug candidates possess potent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory activity but fail when tested 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that mice treated with ARMS-1 either before or following infectious challenge exhibited significantly increased survival compared to vehicle control mice and comparable to oseltamivir-treated mice. In addition, no toxicity was detected in the mice treated with ARMS-1 in our experimental mouse model. In fact, the ARMS-1 treatment group had higher weights and normal activity when compared with untreated, PBS-treated and oseltamivir-treated groups. This protection was most prominent when ARMS-1 was given either 15 minutes before or 4 hours after infection. Both of these time points are prior to clinical symptoms. These findings support prophylactic use and indicate that a CPC-based treatment would probably not work after infection is established. Future studies are needed, including similar 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> trials in ferrets, another important animal model for influenza infection, to assess the potential of CPC-based therapies to protect against influenza disease.
