<p>We found that CPC is active against susceptible and oseltamivir-resistant influenza strains. CPC disrupted influenza particles rapidly, within minutes of exposure, analogous to CPC's effects on other pathogens [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Viral resistance was not observed after prolonged exposure over multiple passages 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, consistent with the physicochemical mechanism of action of CPC. This study demonstrates that CPC can directly disrupt the membranes and subsequently inhibit infection of pathogenic influenza viruses. Lastly, we found that the clinical formulation of CPC reduced influenza-associated morbidity and mortality 
 <italic>in vivo.</italic> These findings have significant implications for the prevention of influenza.
