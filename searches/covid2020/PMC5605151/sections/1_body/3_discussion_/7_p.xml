<p>Overuse of NAIs throughout the world has quickly led to the spread of neuraminidase resistance [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In contrast, QACs, including CPC, have been actively deployed since the 1930s with no apparent reduction in their effectiveness against bacteria and fungi [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The reason that resistance to CPC has not been observed is likely attributable to its mechanism of action, which involves binding to the microbial lipid bilayer, and CPC acts against influenza by disrupting the lipid envelope, which is analogous to the activity against bacteria and fungi. Since the viral envelope is host derived, the physicochemical mechanism of CPC is independent of intrinsic viral proteins and unlikely to be influenced by mutation. We have shown that influenza strains had no significant increase in EC
 <sub>50</sub> after 10 passages in the presence of sub-inhibitory CPC concentrations. This lack of resistance potentiation by CPC contrasts with the dramatic development of oseltamivir resistance after as little as 4 to 6 passages under similar conditions [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In this regard subtherapeutic oseltamivir exposure can result in &gt; 1000-fold increase in IC
 <sub>50</sub> [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, continued exposure of influenza to CPC beyond 10 passages should be performed to ensure that there is no late development of resistance.
