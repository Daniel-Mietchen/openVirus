<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that CPC shows significant activity against influenza via direct virucidal activity by disruption of the viral envelope and no indication of resistance selection. Increased survival was observed in mice treated with the CPC formulation, compared to untreated mice, a finding similar to the anti-influenza agent oseltamivir. We submit that CPC has the ability to protect against influenza respiratory tract infections and should be considered for further clinical development.</p>
