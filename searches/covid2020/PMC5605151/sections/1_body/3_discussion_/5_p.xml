<p>The virucidal kinetics of CPC against influenza viruses sensitive or resistant to oseltamivir were similar to the rapid antimicrobial activity described for bacteria and fungi [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similar findings were reported by Maillard 
 <italic>et al</italic> who found that disruption of bacteriophage F116 structure occurred within minutes following CPC exposure [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For prevention of viral invasion and development of disease, CPC with its broad spectrum and rapid virucidal activity may be preferred.
