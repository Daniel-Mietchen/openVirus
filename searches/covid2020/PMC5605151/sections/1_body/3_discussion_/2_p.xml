<p>Cetylpyridinium chloride is one of the more active quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) but, despite its use in the food, pharmaceutical, and medical industries for over fifty years, there is little data specifically detailing its mechanism of action against viruses. It is assumed that CPC has direct action against lipid bilayer membranes, particularly the cytoplasmic membrane, leading to leakage of cytoplasmic contents and lysis of the microbial cell [

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This mechanism allows for a broad but varied spectrum of activity among different types of microorganisms with bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses such as HIV described as highly susceptible [
