<p>All influenza strains had CPC-associated EC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>2log</sub> well below the CC
 <sub>50</sub> of MDCK cells consistent with a clinically viable therapeutic index. Interestingly, influenza B had lower EC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>2log</sub> compared to influenza A suggesting that this strain is more susceptible to the effects of CPC. The reasons for this remain unclear as both influenza A and B derive their envelope from the host cell. However, reports have shown that the phospholipid composition of purified virions differs from that of the host cells. Whereas phosphatidylcholine is the major component in most mammalian cell membranes, in purified virions phosphatidylethanolamine dominates. In addition, analysis of lipid species of the viral envelope revealed subtle differences between influenza A and B strains [
