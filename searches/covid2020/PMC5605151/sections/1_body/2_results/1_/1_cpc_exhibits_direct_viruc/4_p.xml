<p>Likewise, CPC conferred protection against both susceptible and resistant strains, as measured by time to inactivation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Virus infectivity was reduced by 50% following 5 minutes of exposure to CPC and 90% reduction at 90 minutes. Taken together, these results indicate that CPC has substantial and rapid (within minutes of exposure) antiviral activity against susceptible and resistant influenza virus.
