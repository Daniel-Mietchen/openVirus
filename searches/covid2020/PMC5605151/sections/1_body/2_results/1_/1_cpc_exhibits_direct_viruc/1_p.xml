<p>We found that the percentage effective concentration of CPC (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) against all influenza viruses ranged between 5 μg/mL and 12.5 μg/mL (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) by hemagglutination assay. This was well below the 50% cytotoxic concentration of CPC (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 96 μg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) demonstrating protection vs general cell cytotoxicity, confirmed by microscopic visualization. Influenza A required higher concentrations of CPC to reduce the titer by 50% (H1N1:12.5 ± 5.6 μg/mL, H3N2: 10 ± 5.0 μg/mL), whereas influenza B was significantly more susceptible to the disrupting effects of CPC (5 ± 1.9 μg/mL, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Based on these data, we determined that the therapeutic index (CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of CPC ranges between 7.7 and 19.2 (
