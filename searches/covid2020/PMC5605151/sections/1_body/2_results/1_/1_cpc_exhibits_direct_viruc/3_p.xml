<p>To assess if the susceptibility to CPC is different in oseltamivir-resistant influenza strains, we compared the virucidal activity of CPC against oseltamivir-resistant virus to that of oseltamivir-susceptible strains. Our data showed that CPC was effective against both susceptible and resistant influenza strains. 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the EC
 <sub>50</sub> for resistant influenza A and B viruses were both 8 μg/mL, while the EC
 <sub>50</sub> for susceptible isolates ranged between 5 and 12.5 μg/mL. Notably, these EC50 values were all close to one another suggesting that CPC is equally effective against both susceptible and resistant viral strains.
