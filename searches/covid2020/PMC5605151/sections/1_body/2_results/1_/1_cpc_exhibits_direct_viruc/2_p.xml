<p>Hemagglutination assay results were next confirmed with an infectious assay. Specifically, we determined the EC
 <sub>2Log</sub> by TCID
 <sub>50</sub>. Concordant with hemagglutination data, we observed that CPC conferred a 2 log reduction in influenza virus by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (EC
 <sub>2log</sub>) at ≤20 μg/mL (EC
 <sub>2log</sub>) for all influenza strains tested. Again, influenza B appeared more susceptible to CPC than influenza A (4 μg/mL vs 20 μg/mL respectively).
