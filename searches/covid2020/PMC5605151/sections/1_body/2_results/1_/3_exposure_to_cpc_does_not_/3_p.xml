<p>No increase in EC
 <sub>50</sub> was noted at any concentration for either H1N1 or H3N2. Influenza B demonstrated a slight increase in EC
 <sub>50</sub> when exposed to CPC for 10 passages that was not significant. Of note, influenza B susceptibility to CPC continued to be comparable to that of influenza A. These results suggested that CPC has a low potential to select for influenza virus resistance consistent with its mechanism of action.
