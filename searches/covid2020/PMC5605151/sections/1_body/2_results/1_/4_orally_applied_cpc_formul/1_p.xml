<p>The clinical formulation of CPC named “ARMS-1” is used prophylactically for upper respiratory infections. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, we demonstrated that this topical oral CPC formulation was well-tolerated and reduced the severity and duration of cough and sore throat in the enrolled study participants vs the control group [

To determine the physiological relevance of CPC against influenza, we evaluated the efficacy of the CPC-based clinical formulation ARMS-1 containing 0.1% CPC w/v as the active ingredient [
