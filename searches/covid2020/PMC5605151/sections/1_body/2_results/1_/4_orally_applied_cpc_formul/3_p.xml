<p>Given the promising protection observed prophylactically, we next asked whether ARMS-I might be protective 
 <italic>after</italic> infectious challenge. We found that animals treated 4 hpi with ARMS-I did not have significant weight loss in contrast to animals which were untreated or treated 24 hpi and exhibited up to 10% reduction in body weight, during the first 7 days (

 <italic>(P</italic> = 0.047,
