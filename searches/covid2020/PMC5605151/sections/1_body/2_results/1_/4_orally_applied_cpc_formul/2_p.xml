<p>Evaluation of the prophylactic efficacy of ARMS-I showed that body weights of PBS-treated mice were significantly reduced at 3, 4, 5, and 6 days post infection (dpi), compared to ARMS-I treated mice (
 <italic>P</italic> â‰¤ 0.046, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The increase in relative body weight between ARMS-I-treated and untreated mice ranged between 14% on day 3 and 24.8% on day 6 post-infection. Of note, ARMS-I-treated animals tended to exhibit higher body weights than oseltamivir-treated mice, with a significant difference noted on day 3 (95.7% vs 86.8%, respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.033). Increased weight in ARMS-I-treated animals was consistent with increased activity (decreased morbidity) noted during daily observation. Survival analysis demonstrated that ARMS-I-treated mice exhibited significantly increased survival compared to untreated mice 
 <italic>(P</italic> = 0.0102,
