<p>The mechanism of action of CPC against influenza virus was evaluated using time-course and TEM analyses. First, influenza virus was exposed to CPC for increasing periods of exposure and the remaining intact virus was titered by HA. Exposure of influenza virus to CPC for more than 5 minutes caused â‰¥ 50% decrease of viability in all viral strains tested except H3N2 which attained 50% reduction following 10-minute exposure. Moreover, continued exposure to CPC for 90 minutes led to a 90% decrease in influenza titer (

The presence of negative stain in the interior of virions treated with CPC, but not in untreated virions, suggested permeabilization of the viral membrane. Quantification of the number of intact and disrupted viruses after treatment revealed that 86% (172/200) of the viruses were disrupted or lacked the envelope in CPC-treated samples, while 4.5% (9/200) of untreated virus preparations (in PBS) displayed disrupted or non-enveloped morphologies.
