<p>To further confirm that CPC disrupts the influenza virus envelope, we used ELISA to monitor the release of nucleoprotein from viruses in response to increasing concentrations of CPC. We found that exposure of virus to increasing concentrations of CPC (7.5, 10, and 20 μg/mL) resulted in significantly increased levels of viral nucleoprotein into the media supernatant (
