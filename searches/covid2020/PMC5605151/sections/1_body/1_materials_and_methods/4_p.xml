 <bold>Hemagglutination Assay:</bold> Hemagglutination assays were performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, 25 μL of viral sample was added to 25 μL of CPC diluted in PBS and subsequently incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Serial 2-fold dilutions were mixed with 50 μL of 0.5% suspension of chicken RBCs (Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville PA) and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Data were then presented as the percentage reduction in HA titer. The RBCs were exposed to CPC only to ensure CPC did not have a direct lysing effect on RBCs. Hemagglutination titers were determined as an end point dilution where no pellet was observed. The concentration of chicken RBCs was standardized using a hemocytometer.
