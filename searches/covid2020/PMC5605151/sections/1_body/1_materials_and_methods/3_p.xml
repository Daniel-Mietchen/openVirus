 <bold>Influenza Cell Culture:</bold> Growth of the influenza virus was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Briefly, MDCK were grown to 90% confluence followed by inoculation with influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 hour. The inoculum was then removed and 500 μL of optiMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO)] was applied. Infected cells were grown at 32°C for 72 hours at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Tissue Culture Infective Dose 50% (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) analysis was performed as detailed elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The TCID
 <sub>50</sub> was defined as the amount of virus required to produce a cytopathic effect in 50% of culture wells. The cytopathic effect was defined as focal rounding, degenerative changes, and detachment of cell monolayers.
