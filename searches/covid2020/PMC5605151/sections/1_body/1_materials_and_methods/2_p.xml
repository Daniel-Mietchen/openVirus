 <bold>Cytotoxic Concentration (CC
  <sub>50</sub>) of CPC:
 </bold> Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC number CCL-34) were cultured at 37°C and in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> to 90% confluence in DMEM supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, L-glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, N.Y., USA). Increasing concentrations of CPC (10μg/mL to 250μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were added to media and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Following exposure, cells were washed 3 times in DMEM to remove residual CPC. Complete media was then reapplied and cells were returned to 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Viability was quantitated by neutral red uptake at 48 hours as previously described [

 <sub>50,</sub> Prism; v6.0 software).
