 <bold>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</bold>: Influenza virus (B/Lee/40) was chosen as a prototypical influenza virus and was treated with 50 μg/mL CPC for 5 minutes. A CPC concentration of 50 μg/mL was employed to ensure adequate visualization of CPC activity on TEM analysis while still remaining below CC
 <sub>50</sub> toxicity levels. Fifty microliters of sample were placed on glass slides and formvar/carbon -coated TEM nickel grids (400 mesh) were placed over the samples face down for 1 minute. Influenza virus treated with PBS only was used as a sham control. Next, the grid was removed, blotted with filter paper and exposed to 2.0% uranyl acetate solution for an additional 1 minute. Excess uranyl acetate was removed, grids were air-dried, and examined under an FEI Tecnai Spirit (T12) electron microscope (TEI, Hillsboro, Oregon). Images were captured using a Gatan US4000 4kx4k CCD camera. The reviewer of TEM analysis was masked to treatment vs control slides.
