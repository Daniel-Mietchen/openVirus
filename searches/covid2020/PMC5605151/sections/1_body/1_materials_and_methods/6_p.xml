 <bold>Influenza Nucleoprotein (NP) ELISA:</bold> Samples were adsorbed overnight at 4°C in Costar 96-well plates. Wells were washed with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20-PBS, followed by blocking with BSA (1 g BSA in 50 ml PBS). Next, wells were exposed to mouse anti-influenza B NP antibody (diluted 1:1000, ABCAM) for 2 hours followed by secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:10,000, ABCAM) for 2 hours and finally tetramethylbenzi-dine (TMB) ELISA substrate (ABCAM) for 15 minutes; all incubations were performed at 37°
 <bold>C</bold>. Washes were performed between each incubation and reactions were terminated with ELISA stopping solution. Absorbance at 450 nm was quantified with a Biorad microplate reader. OD values were normalized with unexposed controls.
