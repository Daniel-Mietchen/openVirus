 <bold>Influenza challenge and evaluation of CPC in mice:</bold> Wildtype mice (C57/BL6, Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) were infected intranasally (LD
 <sub>50</sub>, 8.0 x 10
 <sup>3</sup> pfu/mouse) with the mouse-adapted influenza strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8, ATCC). Viral stocks were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs and titered by hemagglutination assay as described above. Viral stocks were then titered 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> to determine the LD
 <sub>50</sub>. The clinical formulation of CPC (ARMS-1 formulated with glycerine and xanthan gum for human use [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]) was given orally. To determine the prophylactic efficacy of ARMS-I, mice were treated with ARMS-1 (5 μL, applied orally) 15 minutes before the challenge and then twice a day for 5 consecutive days. Results were compared with oseltamivir phosphate (1 mg in PBS, applied IP) twice a day for 5 consecutive days or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) alone. Animals were observed daily for general appearance and body weight (calculated as percentage of initial weight on day 0). For assessment of therapeutic efficacy of ARMS-I, mice were challenged with influenza virus as above, and then treated with ARMS-I (10 μL orally) either 4 or 24 hours post infection (hpi), 3 times a day for 5 days. This dosage was chosen to match recommended label usage. Survival and body weight measurements were used to evaluate the effect of ARMS-1, as described above. All experiments were approved by Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol #2011-0200.
