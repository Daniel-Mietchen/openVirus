<p>Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) has been used for decades against a variety of pathogens [

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"/>
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr"/>â€“
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and it disrupts the microbial lipid bilayer through physicochemical interactions, a mechanism that is unlikely to be affected by mutations in addition to being pathogen independent [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For this reason, CPC and other quaternary ammonium compounds are commonly employed in the prevention of bacterial and fungal infections within healthcare settings. Yet there is little evidence demonstrating their effectiveness against respiratory viruses. Here, we evaluated CPC efficacy against the prototypical respiratory influenza virus demonstrating: (1) direct virucidal activity against influenza, (2) rapid activity following exposure, (3) viral ultrastructure disruption, (4) absence of influenza resistance following prolonged exposure, and (5) prevention and treatment of influenza infection in a murine model.
