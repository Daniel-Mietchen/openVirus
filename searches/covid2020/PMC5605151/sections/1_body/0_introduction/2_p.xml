<p>Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs, eg oseltamivir) are approved in the United States to prevent and treat influenza [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the use of antiviral medications for pre-exposure prophylaxis has a very limited role and is generally not recommended for the majority of the population [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also, NAIs confer only modest decreases in symptom duration for individuals presenting with uncomplicated illness [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and this treatment suffers from the selection of resistant strains, adverse effects, and high cost [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While the most effective way to prevent influenza disease and its severe outcomes is by vaccination, current coverage estimates are well below the

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, vaccine/strain mismatch can result in low vaccine efficacy [

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr"/>
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Vaccines may also be contraindicated, unavailable, less effective in immuno-compromised individuals, and suffer from perceived risks leading to “vaccine hesitancy” [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, the development of effective novel strategies to prevent and treat influenza disease is a significant unmet need.
