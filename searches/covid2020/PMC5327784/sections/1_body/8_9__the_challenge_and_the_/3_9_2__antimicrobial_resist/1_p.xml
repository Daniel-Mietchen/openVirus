<p>Another major problem arising from genetic changes is the development of resistance to drugs [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. A typical example is seen in HIV. Besides drug-drug interactions and toxic side effects, drug resistance arising from drug pressure coupled with high rate of genomic variation (during viral replication) is a major obstacle in HIV antiretroviral therapy, leading to treatment failure and necessitating regimen switches [
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Current antiretroviral therapy therefore employs a combination of anti-HIV compounds from at least two classes or drug groups with different mechanisms of action against HIV replication. Combination ART is necessary to suppress plasma HIV viremia, restore immunologic function, and reduce likelihood of drug resistance development for favourable treatment outcomes [
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. The problem of emergence of drug resistant microbes and resistance to antimicrobial agents very well characterizes many bacterial infectious agents such as
 <italic> Escherichia coli</italic>,
 <italic> Pneumococcus</italic>,
 <italic> Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, and
 <italic> Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Many well known antibiotics no longer clear bacterial infections due to microbial resistance. Evolution of drug resistant pathogens thus necessitates continued development of new antiviral and antimicrobial products. As such for HIV alone there are currently at least 25 anti-HIV compounds licensed for the treatment of AIDS [
