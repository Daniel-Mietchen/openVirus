<p>Human engagement in activities that interfere with ecological and environmental conditions continues, thereby increasing the risk of contact with new pathogens. These pathogens are mostly transmitted though intermediate animal hosts such as rodents [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which gain increased contact with humans as a result of environmental and human behavioural factors (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Pathogens may be shared through animal urine and droppings which may be aerosolized and infect susceptible vertebrates including humans. Examples are seen in Lassa fever, Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, and the Nipah virus encephalitis (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>), whose viral pathogens have been found to coevolve with specific rodent species [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].
