<p>Besides host and environmental factors, changes or mutation in the genome of a pathogen, which occurs as a result of exposure to chemicals and antimicrobial agents (e.g., antibiotic), may lead to gene damage [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and emergence of drug resistant pathogen variants that could cause new disease [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, human, microbial, and environmental factors constitute major causes of infectious disease emergence and the virulence or pathogenic potential depends on a complex combination of these factors [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, generally, emerging infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens are responsible for the greatest proportion of the EID threat, having caused about two-thirds of the infectious disease burden and usually characterized by very high epidemics. Examples are Filoviruses, Ebola, and Marburg [
