<p>The HRV1A titers were determined in a 24-well cell culture plate containing subconfluence (90–95%) HeLa cell monolayers using plaque assay. Briefly, the HRV1A virus inoculum was diluted 1 : 10 in PBS
 <sup>++</sup>/BA. The growth media from HeLa cells were removed and the cell monolayers were washed using PBS
 <sup>++</sup>. The diluted virus was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 33°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and then removed. 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of Avicel-media containing 1x MEM and 1.25% Avicel (FMC BioPolymer, Belgium) was added and cells were further incubated for 48 h at 33°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After removal of the overlay media, the cell monolayers were washed with PBS
 <sup>++</sup>, stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution, further washed, and dried. The plaques corresponding to propagating viral particles were counted. The H1N1pdm titers were determined in MDCK-II using focus assay. To analyze the binase effect against H1N1pdm or HRV1A and identify the EC
 <sub>50</sub> of binase, the plaques were counted and PFU/ml was measured using MS Excel Software package. The PFU/ml values of the binase nontreated infected HeLa cells were used as 100%. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined using GraphPad Prism 5.0 Software (GraphPad Software Inc., USA) by plotting the percentage of viable cells as a function of the compound concentration.
