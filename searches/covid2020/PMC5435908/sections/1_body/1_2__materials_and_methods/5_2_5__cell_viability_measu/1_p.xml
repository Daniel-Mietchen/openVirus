<p>The cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>, the concentration of compound that causes death to 50% of viable cells) of HeLa cells under binase treatment was measured using MTT assay as described by Shah Mahmud and Ilinskaya [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, growth medium of subconfluence HeLa cells in a 96-well plate (in triplicate) was replaced with DMEM containing different concentration of binase (at final concentrations of 0.005–500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and kept for 24 h at 33°C in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. After aspirating the media and washing with PBS
 <sup>++</sup> (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.9 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>) the cells were left to recover for 60 min in growth medium and then replaced by 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of MTT-mix (growth DMEM medium containing 0.123 mg/ml of MTT-reagent = 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2- yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan, Sigma Aldrich, USA). The cells were further incubated for 60 min at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After discarding the MTT-mix, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA paraformaldehyde (Roth, Germany) for 30 min at RT (room temperature) and then the fixing solution was discarded. The cells were air dried for 10–15 min and the tetrazolium crystals were dissolved by adding 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of isopropanol to each well. The plates were shaken for 10 min and analyzed photometrically at 492 nm excitation in an ELISA reader EL808 (BioTek, USA). The MTT value of the binase nontreated control was used as 100%. The percentage of cell viability after binase exposure was calculated as follows: percentage viability = 100/(MTT value of control × MTT value of binase-treated sample). The CC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined using GraphPad Prism 5.0 Software (GraphPad Software Inc., USA) by plotting the percentage of viable cells as a function of the compound concentration.
