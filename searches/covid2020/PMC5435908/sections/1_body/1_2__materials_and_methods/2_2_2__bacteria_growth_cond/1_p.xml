<p>Binase (EC 3.1.27.3; bacterial extracellular guanyl-preferring ribonuclease) was collected from the culture medium of
 <italic> Bacillus pumilus</italic> B3073 (the former name is
 <italic> B. intermedius</italic> B3073 [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). The cultures were grown in a 1 L conical flask containing 1/5 flask volume of the phosphate deficient liquid medium (2.0% low phosphate peptone, 1.0% glucose, 1.0% CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.3% NaCl, 0.03% MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>  × 7H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and 0.01% MnSO
 <sub>4</sub>, pH 8.5) with 200 rpm in a Multitron shaking incubator (INFORS HT, Switzerland) at 37°C until the beginning of the stationary phase of bacterial growth. After centrifugation at 6000
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min, the pelleted bacterial cells were removed; the supernatant was acidified by glacial acetic acid to pH 5.0, diluted 1 : 5 in double-distilled water (ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O), and applied on the column with DE-32 cellulose (Whatman, UK) equilibrated with 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The flow through from DE-32 was transferred to column packed with phosphocellulose P11 (Whatman, UK) equilibrated with 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The system was then equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Binase was eluted with 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Further polishing purification of binase was performed using the UnoS column and BioLogic DuoFlow chromatography system (Bio-Rad, USA) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and eluted using a linear gradient of 0–0.25 M NaCl. Elution fractions of 5 ml were collected. The protein samples were frozen overnight at −20°C, followed by freezing for 15 min at −80°C and then lyophilized for 48 h at −50°C under vacuum using a Labconco FreeZone 2.5 Liter Freeze Dry System (Labconco, USA). Homogeneity and authenticity of the purified enzyme were confirmed by PAAG electrophoresis, Western blotting, and MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry on UltrafleXtreme (Bruker Corporation, Germany) as described in [
