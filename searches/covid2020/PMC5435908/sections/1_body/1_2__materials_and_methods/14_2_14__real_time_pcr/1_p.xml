<p>To quantify the cellular and viral mRNA in A549 cells using qPCRmix-HS SYBR Kit (Evrogen, Russia), the 4 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of each cDNA (1–100 ng to each reaction) (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.13">Section 2.13</xref>), 0.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>M of each (forward and reverse) primers, and 1x qPCRmix-HS SYBR (Evrogen, Russia) were mixed in a LightCycler 480 Multiwell Plate 96 (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) on ice in the dark and covered by LightCycler 480 Sealing Foil. Thermal cycling was done on a LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) system under the following conditions: 10 min at 95°C; 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C; 30 sec at 60°C; and 30 sec at 30°C. The quantification and data analysis was performed using the LightCycler 480 Service Software (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland). For identification of binase action on cellular mRNA or H1N1pdm viral NP mRNA accumulation according to the relative fold-difference of expression levels (relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments) using internal control, mRNA expression data of a reference GAPDH gene was used to correct the control/calibrator (binase nontreated) and test/experimental (binase-treated) samples data. The ΔCt value of the calibrator from influenza virus-infected and binase nontreated cells (Ct
 <sub>target</sub> (Ct value obtained using H1N1pdm viral NP mRNA specific primers in A549 cells) −Ct
 <sub>reference</sub> (Ct value obtained using GAPDH mRNA primers in A549 cells)) and ΔCt value of the test from influenza virus-infected and binase-treated cells (Ct
 <sub>target</sub> − Ct
 <sub>reference</sub>) were calculated. The fold change was calculated using 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> value, where ΔΔCt = ΔCt, test − ΔCt, calibrator.
