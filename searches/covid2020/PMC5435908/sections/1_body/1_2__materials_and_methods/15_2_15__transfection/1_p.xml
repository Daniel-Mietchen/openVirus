<p>To investigate the effect of binase on the gene expression activity of H1N1pdm virus, 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g of every five plasmids (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.12">Section 2.12</xref>) encoding viral ribonucleoprotein complex together with pPOLI-GFP-RT was cotransfected into A549 cells as previously described with minor modifications (in triplicate) [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, the transfection mixture consisting of 180 
 <italic>μ</italic>l “Opti-MEM” (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and total of 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g of plasmid DNA along with 12 
 <italic>μ</italic>l “TransIT-2020” (Mirus Bio, USA) was incubated for 45 min at RT. Then, the mixture was diluted to 1 ml using “Opti-MEM” and transferred to 80–90% confluent A549 cell monolayer (grown in 6-well plate) to allow transfection. The cells were then kept for 12 h at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. The transfection medium was replaced with 2 ml of Opti-MEM containing 0.2% BA and P/S with binase (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) or without binase. After 36 h, the GFP expression was visualized and counted by Axiovert 35 inverted fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, Germany).
