<p>To determine the effect of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml binase against H1N1pdm virus, the A549 monolayers were subcultured to prepare 96-well plates (10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 8). Following the overnight 90–95% confluency of the monolayers, the growth medium was removed and cell monolayers were washed with PBS
 <sup>++</sup>. Virus suspension containing H1N1pdm with MOI = 1 diluted in PBS
 <sup>++</sup>/BA (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at RT. The viral supernatant was then removed and binase at a final concentration of 10 or 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml in an infection medium (DMEM containing 100 U ml
 <sup>−1</sup> penicillin, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml streptomycin, 0.2% BSA (PAA, Germany), and 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin) was added. The cells were incubated for 12 h and then the viral loads in the collected supernatants were estimated using focus assay as described in [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The cell monolayers were subjected to cellular total protein or RNA extractions for further investigations. The binase and virus preincubation for 45 min and infection and incubation steps were performed as previously described by Shah Mahmud and Ilinskaya [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
