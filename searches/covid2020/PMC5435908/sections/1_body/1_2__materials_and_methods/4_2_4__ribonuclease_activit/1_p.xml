<p>To identify the enzymatic activity of binase, the growth medium from subconfluence (90–95%) A549 cells in a 96-well plate (in triplicate) was replaced with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml binase (final concentration) containing complete DMEM and incubated for 48 h at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The supernatant (cell culture fluid) containing binase was collected to measure the binase activity using RNase activity assay as described before (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.3">Section 2.3</xref>).
