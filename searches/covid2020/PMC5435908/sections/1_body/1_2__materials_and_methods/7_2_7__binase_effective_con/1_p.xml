<p>The effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>, the concentration of compound which reduces the virus titer by 50%) of binase against HRV1A was determined in HeLa cells. The cells were grown in a 48-well plate (in triplicate) overnight at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cell monolayers were then washed and infected with 75 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of virus suspension in PBS
 <sup>++</sup>/BA (MOI = 1) for 1 h at 33°C. After removing the virus inoculum, cells were incubated with 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>l growth medium in each well containing different concentrations of binase (at final concentrations of 0.01–500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) for 24 h, at 33°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The supernatants containing HRV1A virus were assayed for their viral titers using plaque assay.
