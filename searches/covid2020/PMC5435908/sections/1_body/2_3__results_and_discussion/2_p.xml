<p>The catalytic activity of binase (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) in A549 cell culture media decreased to 50% after 48 h incubation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>) that corresponded to the data obtained earlier for 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml binase [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Binase is a thermo- and pH-stable agent, which can be used in vivo retaining its activity. The 49% reduction of binase activity in the cell culture fluid can be explained by internalization of the enzyme to the A549 cells. Binase internalization to A549 cell cytoplasm and nucleus was previously illustrated by immunofluorescence methods [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Possible inhibition of catalytic activity and partial degradation of binase by extracellular proteases are not excluded though. Thus, binase acts as the antiviral agent under wide range of concentrations after short and long period of incubation. Moreover, the additional binase administration is not needed during 48 h.
