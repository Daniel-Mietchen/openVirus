<p>It is known that binase at concentrations up to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml is not toxic towards A549 cells [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] while inhibiting H1N1pdm virus propagation [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We have shown here that a concentration of binase of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml without preincubation of the virus (at an MOI of 1) with binase reduced the infectious titer in A549 cell culture by 40% after a single replication round (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>). Therefore, binase seems to be able to act intracellularly on viruses before they exit the cells. This raises a question regarding antiviral targets of binase in the virus-infected cells. We performed a 2D-DIGE of binase-treated and nontreated cells. It was determined that binase at 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml does not alter the spectrum of A549 cellular proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). Moreover, the expression of cellular housekeeping genes, measured by mRNA levels of genes encoding structural protein ACTB and metabolic protein GAPDH, was not changed upon treatment of A549 cells with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of binase followed by 12 h incubation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). At the same time, binase reduced H1N1pdm viral NP mRNA accumulation in the A549 cells infected with virus at an MOI of 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>), probably, reflecting the specific reduction of viral RNA. Expression of the gene was 20% lower in binase-treated virus-infected cells than in the virus-infected binase nontreated cells. These results support the idea of an inhibitory effect of binase on virus replication (
