<p>To gain a more detailed evidence of binase effect on H1N1pdm viral gene expression in A549 cells we used a plasmid based reverse genetic system containing a set of plasmids encoding PB1, PB2, PA, and NP genes of H1N1pdm viral RNP complex and an influenza virus-like RNA encoding a GFP reporter protein (see Sections 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.12">2.12</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.15">2.15</xref>). GFP fluorescence is detectable only if plasmid-encoded genes for the RNP complex and the virus-like RNA are expressed. It was determined that binase reduced the viral RNA expression by 4.4 times indicating the binase inhibition of the expression of viral genes (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(b)</xref>). Therefore, a target of binase antiviral action could be viral mRNA. Its degradation prevents synthesis of viral proteins.
