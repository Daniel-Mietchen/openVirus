 <caption> Viability of HeLa cells treated by binase (24 h) (a) and the influence of binase on HRV1A virus titer after 24 h incubation of HeLa cells with different concentrations of the RNase. CC 50 and EC 50 are the binase concentration, which induces 50% cell death and 50% reduction of virus titer, respectively. 1  μg/ μL of binase corresponds to 82  μM. The R-squared value and cytotoxic and effective concentrations were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 Software. </caption>
