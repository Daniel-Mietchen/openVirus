 <caption> Effect of binase on functional H1N1pdm viral RNP polymerase complex formation in A549 cells transfected by plasmids (pHW) encoding vRNP subunits (PB1, PB2, and PA) and NP of H1N1pdm virus together with vRNA-like transcript pPOLI-GFP-RT encoding GFP. Decrease of GFP expression in the cells treated by binase (a) and visualization of this effect using Axiovert 35 inverted fluorescent microscope (b). (i) A549 cells carrying PAM 503 plasmid as GFP expression control; (ii) A549 cells without binase treatment; (iii) A549 cells treated by 10  μg/ml binase after transfections. Statistical significance was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 Software and assessed by Student's t-test: ∗ P &lt; 0.001. </caption>
