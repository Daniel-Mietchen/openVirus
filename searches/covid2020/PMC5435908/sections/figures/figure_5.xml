  <p>Viability of HeLa cells treated by binase (24 h) (a) and the influence of binase on HRV1A virus titer after 24 h incubation of HeLa cells with different concentrations of the RNase. CC
   <sub>50</sub> and EC
   <sub>50</sub> are the binase concentration, which induces 50% cell death and 50% reduction of virus titer, respectively. 1 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/
   <italic>μ</italic>L of binase corresponds to 82 
   <italic>μ</italic>M. The
   <italic> R</italic>-squared value and cytotoxic and effective concentrations were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 Software.
