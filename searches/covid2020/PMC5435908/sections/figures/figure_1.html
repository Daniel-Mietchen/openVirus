 <caption> (a) Decrease of H1N1pdm virus titer in A549 cells infected by virus at an MOI of 0.01 and 0.1 which was preincubated with 10  μg/ml binase for 45 min prior to cell infection; (b) binase catalytic activity in cell-free medium and A549 cell culture medium after 48 h incubation; (c) virus titer after 12 h incubation of A549 cells treated by 100  μg/ml binase and infected by H1N1pdm virus at an MOI of 1. FFU/ml were calculated using supernatant after single-cycle replication of virus. Statistical significance was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 Software and assessed by Student's t-test: ∗ P &lt; 0.001. </caption>
