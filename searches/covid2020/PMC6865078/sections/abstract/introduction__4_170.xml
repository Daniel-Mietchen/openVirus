  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>The Mediterranean diet (MD) is considered one of the healthiest diets worldwide, since it has been shown to reduce the risk of many chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease, cancer and obesity. Despite this evidence, a global shifting from the MD was documented - especially in the Mediterranean region - as a consequence of the economic crisis and the phenomenon of westernization. Here, we evaluated the adherence to MD and its major social and behavioural determinants in a large sample of Italian women from Catania, Italy.</p>

  <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
  <p>This cross-sectional analysis included 841 women, aged 25-64 years, with no history of severe diseases. Adherence to MD was assessed by Food Frequency Questionnaire and the Mediterranean Diet score (MDS) based on 9 components. Associations of social (i.e. educational level, employment and marital status, and parity) and behavioral (i.e. smoking habit, physical activity, and BMI) determinants with adherence to MD and its components were tested by multivariable logistic regression analysis and expressed as Odds ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI).</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>According to MDS (mean = 4.2; range = 0-8), we identified 33.8% of women with low adherence to MD (MDS ≤ 3), 56.8% with medium adherence (3 &lt; MDS &lt; 7), and 9.4% with high adherence (MDS ≥ 7). Among social characteristics, medium and high educational levels were associated with ideal intake of alcohol (OR = 4.059; 95%CI = 1.311-12.570; p = 0.015; OR = 4.258 95%CI = 1.068-16.976; p = 0.040; respectively), living in couple with ideal intake of cereals (OR = 2.801 95%CI = 1.188-6.602; p = 0.018), and having children with ideal intake of fruits (OR = 3.149; 95%CI = 1.245-7.762; p = 0.015). With respect to behaviors, no smoking was associated with ideal intake of meat (OR = 2.227 95%CI = 1.091-4.548; p = 0.028) and dairy products (OR = 2.205 95%CI = 1.110-4.379; p = 0.020), while high physical activity was associated with ideal intake of vegetables (OR = 6.148; 95%CI = 1.506-25.104; p = 0.011) and legumes (OR = 5.832; 95%CI = 1.414-24.063; p = 0.015). Particularly, moderately or highly physically active women were more likely to show medium or high adherence to MD than those who performed less physical activity (OR = 6.024 95%CI = 1.192-30.440; p = 0.040; OR = 9.965 95%CI = 1.683-58.993; p = 0.011; respectively).</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>Our study demonstrated that several social factors and behaviors were closely associated with adherence to MD. These findings are important to understand the global shifting from the MD and to develop public health strategies for reducing health inequalities in the Mediterranean region and for health promotion.</p>
