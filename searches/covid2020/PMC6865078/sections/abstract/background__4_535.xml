  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
  <p>Vaccines have greatly reduced the burden of infectious diseases worldwide. The European Union has recognized immunization programs as key prevention interventions to reduce the burden and related costs of infectious diseases in Europe and has stressed the importance of adopting a life-course approach to immunization. Nonetheless, vaccine coverage rates in many European countries remain low for all age groups target populations and are still far from coverage targets set by national and international health authorities. Information and communication technology (ICT) has a great potential to improve vaccine uptake supporting actions aimed at increasing the demand of vaccines and the supply of effective and efficient life-course immunization services.</p>

  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p>The EUVIS project is coordinated by the School of Public Health of the University Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, Italy. It consists of two parts: the conduction of a systematic review (part I) and the conduction of large-scale surveys among EU Member States (part II). The systematic review is aimed at retrieving and pooling all available evidence on the effectiveness of different ICT-based interventions to promote immunization; the survey is aimed at assessing the use of ICT by EU health authorities in the context of life-course immunization programs, as well as the application of ICT to community-based and providers-based interventions to increase vaccine acceptance in different age groups and populations.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>In the systematic review of part I we extracted data from 68 RCTs assessing the use of ICT to improve immunization uptake and associated outcomes. Results were analyzed by vaccine type, type of ICT and target population. The findings showed that to be more effective the interventions must be tailored to target populations’ specific characteristics and needs. The review’s outputs will be used to build and inform part II of the EUVIS project.</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>These data are of crucial importance to identify which ICT-based interventions are more effective in each target group, to plan and implement immunization programs. Results showed that even though technological innovations have made significant contributions to healthcare, their role to increase vaccination uptake cannot be taken for granted. Data collected through the systematic review and the survey will inform the planning and implementation of specific ICT-based models to increase vaccination uptake in Europe.</p>
