  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and benzisothiazolinone (BIT) are widely used as biocides in several personal care products such as cleaning agents, paints, and resin emulsions and can be considered as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Due to their wide industrial production and domestic use, MIT and BIT can be detected in wastewater at varying concentrations. Despite their inherent properties as biocides, few studies evaluated the fate and effects of BIT and MIT in biological sludges and the risk when discharged into the environment. The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of BIT and MIT onto the activated sludge. A framework tool was proposed to assess their toxicity (i.e. counts of bacteria and protozoa) and recognized biological models such as 
   <italic>Raphidocelis subcapitata</italic> (growth inhibition) and 
   <italic>Aliivibrio fischeri</italic> (bioluminescence inhibition).

  <title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title>
  <p>Two series of batch experiments were conducted with fresh mixed liquor (ML) from aeration basins sampled from a local wastewater plant. In the batch test, 2 L glass beakers with 1 L of mixed liquor were run for 24 h following both biodegradation and adsorption of BIT and MIT. During the first experimental run, both biodegradation and adsorption were allowed to occur, while during the second run biodegradation was inhibited by NaN
   <sub>3</sub>. BIT and MIT toxicity was assessed considering i) bioassays with 
   <italic>Raphidocelis subcapitata</italic> (ISO 8692:2012) and 
   <italic>Aliivibrio fischeri</italic> (ISO 11348:2007); ii) respirometric tests associated to bacteria and protozoa count.

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>Preliminary results suggested that adsorption could be the main removal mechanism for BIT and MIT. After their addition to the ML, bacteria and protozoa populations decreased, but the sludge rapidly acclimatized as reported by respirometric test curves. According to 
   <italic>R. subcapitata</italic> and 
   <italic>A. fischeri</italic>, BIT was more toxic than MIT.

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>MIT and BIT proved to affect the viability of activated sludge. 
   <italic>R. subcapitata</italic> was more sensitive to MIT, while 
   <italic>A. fischeri</italic> to BIT. Further studies are necessary to monitor environmental concentrations of MIT and BIT and existing activated sludge wastewater treatment plant reduction/removal performance.
