  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) are one of the most common causes of serious complications in hospitals. The rate of operating room (OR) associated HAI is strongly influenced by the OR environmental quality. During surgical procedures, dust particles, textile fibres, skin scales and respiratory aerosols are released from the surgical team, surrounding equipment and from outdoor and indoor air into the OR. These particles are suitable supports to be loaded with viable microorganisms triggering HAI. Despite that, in literature, correlation between air quality as a potential HAI risk factor has been poorly explored. The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between HAI, air particulate (PM 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 µm) and airborne microorganisms (total CFU) in ORs.</p>

  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p>ORs environmental data have been collected since July 2018 at IRCCS San Martino Hospital in Genoa, Italy (5 800 personnel, 1 327 beds, 350 000 m
   <sup>2</sup> surface, 55 buildings, 48 ORs). We adopted case definitions for HAI as reported in ECDC’s Point Prevalence Survey protocol (version 5.3), considering an HAI, when not specified, related with the surgery when arose in the first 48h after the surgery. Patients will be retrospectively followed both in the post-operative stay and in eventual outpatient accesses for 30 (90 in case of implant) days after the surgery. Hospital and demographic data will be obtained through the hospital’s informatics systems. Air particulate and air microorganisms sampling are carried out respectively with AeroTrak Portable Particle Counter (model 9500) and SAS Super 180 Microbial Air Sampler. The presence of other possible risk factors for OR associated HAI insurgence (such as the nature of the surgery or the operating team’s behaviour) will be also indicated.

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>Data are insofar available for the first sampling of each selected OR. To avoid the largest possible number of biases, each OR should be primarily compared to itself in different periods if differences in air quality are recorded. Raw data of the first samplings show differences between different ORs both in terms of HAI frequency and air quality as related to PM and airborne microorganisms.</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>Results provide evidence that an integrated approach between environmental monitoring, microbiological monitoring and epidemiological survey in hospital is required to effectively attenuate HAI onset in hospital. This aspecific preventive approach is nowadays gaining importance due to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The present model will provide a valuable support tool in health management decisions on HAI matters.</p>
