  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
  <p>Neuromedin U is a hypothalamic neuropeptide with several functions, considered to be a potential therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to analyse the association between epigenetic and genetic variants in genes encoding Neuromedin U pathway proteins and cardiovascular risk, in Italian adults from the general population recruited for the Moli-sani study.</p>

  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p>A case-cohort design nested in the Moli-sani cohort study was used. A subcohort of 1,146 subjects (mean ± SD age 55.3 ± 11.7 years; men 47.7%) was randomly selected from the whole study population (n = 24,325; recruitment years 2005-2010, Molise Region). All CVD events occurred during a median follow-up of 4.3 years (n = 534 validated myocardial infarctions or strokes; 5.1:1,000 person-years), were selected as case group. Biobank samples were used to genotype 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes 
   <italic>NMU</italic> (encoding for Neuromedin U), 
   <italic>NMUR1</italic> and 
   <italic>NMUR2</italic> (receptors) and 
   <italic>NMS</italic> (Neuromedin S). Methylation levels at 17 CpG sites of two NMU regions (promoter and intergenic) were measured using pyrosequencing. The laboratory analyses are on-going. The associations between SNPs (codominant model) or methylation sites (
   <italic>z</italic>-scores) and fatal or non-fatal CVD events were calculated (hazard ratios - HR, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, glucose, lipid levels and CVD history) using SAS software. Multivariate analyses (backward elimination) were performed and a score was computed using beta estimates of risk variants associated with the events at p
   <italic/> &lt; 0.1.

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>Laboratory tests for a subsample of 394 subjects (subcohort, with 12 CVD events occurred in 5.6 years; 5.4:1,000 person-years) and 41 CVD events (case group) were available for this preliminary analysis. Three SNPs (
   <italic>NMU</italic> rs62310886, 
   <italic>NMUR1</italic> rs3769987 and rs6754952) and three 
   <italic>NMU</italic> CpG sites (CpG 3 and CpG 4 of 32 region, CpG 8 of 76 region) showed a statistically significant association with CVD (
   <italic>p</italic> from &lt; 0.0001 to 0.037), independently from CVD risk factors. A total of eight genetic and epigenetic biomarkers were associated with the events at p &lt; 0.10 and were included in the score. The HR for 1 score SD was 5.84 (95% CI: 3.17-10.76). A HR of 4.01 (95% CI: 2.37-6.78) was found comparing the 3
   <sup>rd</sup> vs the 1
   <sup>st</sup> tertile of the score.

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>Italian adults carrying epigenetic and genetic variants in genes from the 
   <italic>NMU</italic> pathway are at increased CVD risk. The association independent from classical risk factors suggests a potential clinical application for NMU biomarkers when added to current algorithms for CVD risk assessment.
