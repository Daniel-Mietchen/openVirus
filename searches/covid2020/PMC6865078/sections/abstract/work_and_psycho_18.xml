 <p>The analysis of the national and international reference context provided by Eurostat, Eurofound and INAIL reports on work-related diseases in recent years shows a prospective increase correlated to seniority and a more significant incidence in healthcare facilities, in particular due to the risk factors of biomechanical overload and work-related stress. These reports launch an alert for the significant increase in the working population aged over 55 by 2030, which is more significant in Italy due to the recent changes to the social security system. In this context, complex healthcare authorities have to face relevant organizational and managerial problems, also in the light of the turn-over policies implemented in recent years, as a result of the overall resources reduction in the healthcare system. This causes a considerable difficulty for healthcare authorities in maintaining the right balance between the need to protect the workers’ health and that of guaranteeing business functionality and containment of public spending, with possible repercussions also on the quality of care and patient safety. In order to reduce the impact of diseconomies, inefficiencies and negative consequences on the work atmosphere, it is increasingly necessary to operate through the prevention strategies on the most important risk factors, the main causes of work restrictions, through the integrated Workplace Health Promotion (WHP) approach and Total Worker Health (TWH), aimed at combining and integrating interventions for work well-being, health promotion, disability management and safety at the workplace. The work well-being must be considered as the authorities’ ability to promote and maintain the highest degree of the workers’ physical, psychological and social well-being, connected to several variables linked to the risks that working activities involve, including the organizational ones. Since the human factor is a fundamental asset of the Hospital, it is necessary to always pay much attention to the workers, as persons called to cooperate with the authorities’ objectives, through actions aimed at meeting the individuals’ specificities and needs on the same wavelength of the authorities’ needs and which can affect the improvement of the internal social system, interpersonal relationships and, in general, “the organization health”. Therefore, it seems appropriate to promote the coordination of the integrated WHP activities, within a complex reality such as that of a hospital, where different areas with specific purposes can develop. To this purpose, in addition to the activities already implemented in the field of assessment and management of occupational risks and health surveillance, it cannot no longer be delayed the implementation of other activities aimed at prevention and health promotion, considered in its broadest sense, and their evaluation in order to measure their effectiveness through a set of shared indicators.</p>
 <p>In this sense, three specific lines of action have been adopted in recent years at Bambino Gesù Pediatric Hospital (OPBG), IRCCS: the first aimed at eliminating organizational constraints, a cause of personnel discomfort, a conflictual climate and, in the long term, the system inefficiency; the second concerns the health promotion actions aimed at reaching the workers’ well-being, such as attention to correct lifestyles, oncologic prevention and chronic-degenerative pathologies, cause of most of the personnel invalidity and unsuitability; finally, the third activity, dedicated to the development of the Disability Management, aimed not only at assessing and relocating that staff with limitations and/or disabilities, but also at proposing specific improvement interventions.</p>

  <title>WORK AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING</title>
  <p>In this context, a work-related stress assessment system and related improvement actions have been implemented, with the aim of reducing and/or eliminating organizational constraints, which cause discomfort to the personnel and that, in the long term, can reduce performance and corporate productivity. Some of the actions implemented in this area stem from the need to create a communication culture, responding to one of the critical issues more frequently highlighted in the results of the authorities’ welfare surveys, as well as the managerial training process. This need is most noticeable in the lack of awareness of the importance of communication and listening to personnel up to an ineffective communication, which inevitably affects both the quality of relationships within the Hospital, thus undermining the Community, key value of a healthy and efficient organization, and the quality of care. The first line of intervention is primarily aimed at satisfying this need, implementing a specific training for the development of both individual and corporate awareness. Alongside these initiatives, the psychological support paths are of particular relevance, both at the individual level, through the company Help Point, and at that of homogeneous groups of workers, through professional empowerment, Yoga and Mindfulness courses aimed at reducing discomfort, thus making workers less fragile in the presence of “stress”.</p>

  <title>HEALTH PROMOTION</title>
  <p>The second line of activity coincides with the area of “Health Promotion”. It is based on the analysis of the current working context, characterized by the working population aging and the progressive increase of the main causes of mortality, disability and work restrictions represented by chronic non-transmittable diseases to incorrect lifestyles. The evolution of the working context in this regard associated with the prospective increase in Italy (+ 121.5% in the last 5 years) of work-related diseases, with a more significant incidence in health facilities, highlights the need to manage the increasingly difficult balance between workers’ general health conditions and work demands. The main actions in this area concern interventions of primary and secondary prevention of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and oncological pathologies, acting through the development of specific screening pathways, health protocols and promotion of correct lifestyles. In this regard, food education programs, courses for smoking cessation, back school courses for postural re-education, promotion of physical activity in the workplace, osteopathic pathways for workers suffering from osteoarticular diseases, free vaccination campaigns and screening have been implemented for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and tumors.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>DISABILITY MANAGEMENT</title>
  <p>the third objective aims at structuring the area of “Disability Management” and concerns tertiary prevention and, therefore, assessment, recovery and appropriate relocation of personnel with disabilities and/or unfitness, in order to allow an effective use of these resources and minimize the production loss due to absenteeism, disease, replacement of personnel and any possible disputes. To this purpose, the appropriately structured multidisciplinary team develops and promotes targeted plans and strategies aimed at different levels (health, organizational, structural etc.) with the purpose of assessing and relocating personnel with limitations and/or disabilities, as well as developing specific improvement proposals that, through a personalized risk assessment, can also make the disabled or with limitations worker efficient and work-compatible.</p>
  <p>The hospital’s WHP activities were organized and developed starting from 2017 through an integrated strategic business plan and implemented according to the most recent evidence. The plan is addressed to all OPBG employees with the aim of disseminating and promoting individual and community well-being, acting on the “health” levers, intended as a common good to be protected and developed within the OPBG Community. The Plan is being developed also in relation to areas broader than the hospital through, for example, a joint program with the European network of Workplace Health Promotion (ENWHP Network), with the aim of spreading health promotion best practices in the work places and collaborating in structuring a validated and shared model at national and international level, also in relation to the adoption of a system of indicators for the performance evaluation of WHP programs. In fact, as widely reported in literature, and also confirmed in our Hospital, individual and working well-being has direct and indirect repercussions on various economic and non-economic factors and indicators, such as absenteeism, high turnover, increased transfer requests, low levels of motivation, lack of trust and commitment, increase in complaints, suitability with limitations, occupational diseases and labor law disputes. The evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions and prevention programs is more and more represented in terms of Return on Investment (ROI) for those companies that invest in the health and safety of their workers. In this regard, a number of key indicators relating to the workers’ health and safety performance detected within the hospital, have been evaluated. Absences due to illness amount to 11.5 days per year per worker. It has been confirmed that this datum is much lower than the national average of the private healthcare field (where an index of sick leave of 18.1 days per worker per year has been reported). With regard to the occupational diseases, the percentage of complaints is 1.11 per 1,000 workers, compared to a national average of 2.9. The figure is also lower than the corporate average of the last 5 years (1.64 occupational diseases per 1000 workers). The risk factor related to the complaints received is the biomechanical overload of the spine and upper limbs. Finally, the percentage of suitability of people with limitations for work is equal to 5.8% of the personnel, with a value significantly lower than the national trend (11.8-22.6%) for healthcare facilities.</p>
  <p>The proposal to implement an integrated Workplace Health Promotion program within the Hospital stems from the analysis of the impact of work discomfort and workforce aging on company health with the consequent negative repercussions both in terms of workers’ psychological and physical well-being of workers, and economic value. Human being should be at the center of an efficient organization; therefore not only the patients should receive the proper attention, but also the health operators who daily take care of them, since their state of health and well-being, as well as that of the organization in general, inevitably affects that of the patients. An aspect to be taken into consideration, which accounts for the efforts required in this area, is that related to the high complexity of the health profession, both from a physical point of view, given the multiplicity of occupational risks that the operator has to face daily, and a psychic one, in consideration of the high professional level required and the emotional burden that daily work involves.</p>
  <p>The implementation and evaluation of the various health promotion interventions envisaged by the Authority’s Strategic Plan are based on monitoring and analysis of indicators, both subjective, such as those deriving from surveys on company’s climate and work-related stress, and objective, such as absenteeism, occupational diseases, suitability with pre-and post-limitations, as well as verifications of health promotion interventions. The effectiveness of these interventions confirms the importance of investing in prevention and health promotion within complex working contexts in order to contribute to the development of a healthy and efficient reality.</p>
