 <p>Migrant populations have specific health needs often due to social vulnerability. Furthermore, the massive migration flows and cross-border populations’ transit of last decades impose the planning, implementation, and evaluation of new integrated services and programs to promote equity in health-care systems. The incredible advances in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Digital Health could be an important resource to promote efficiency and quality. Nevertheless, no conclusive evidence exists on the great potential offered by ICT to promote health-care in migrant populations. To fill this gap, we focused on researching evidence of digital health applications in the field of communicable diseases control.</p>
 <p>We carried out a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to retrieve, pool and critically appraise all the available evidence on the effectiveness of ICT-based interventions to promote the communicable diseases control in migrant and in-transit populations. We searched the electronic databases Medline and Embase, relevant grey literature and consulted with experts in the field. We restricted the area of interest to EU/EEA countries and included only studies with original data published before the 31
  <sup>st</sup> of January 2019.

 <p>Out of 127 retrieved records, 52 articles focused on ICT-based interventions to improve migrant health, and 29 (56%) met the inclusion criteria for Communicable Diseases control. The majority of the studies contained interventions of prevention (76%), while just a minority had interventions of diagnosis (7%) and follow-up (17%), and no-one proposed therapies. The countries of implementation were mainly Germany and the United Kingdom, (5 studies each), while only 1 study was implemented in Italy. The most interesting results referred to data sharing, health promotion and the use of social networks or websites to reach specific subgroups at risk. The most targeted single topics were Sexually Transmitted Infections (including HIV), Tuberculosis and Vaccine Preventable Diseases.</p>
 <p>Selected ICT-based interventions have been implemented in Europe to promote health-care in migrant populations, and the control of Communicable Diseases occupies an important quota in here. However, in most cases, no monitoring and evaluation exist on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such interventions. With the common aim of protecting in-transit populations’ health, more specific action is needed to identify effective interventions and share best practices. To note, the research on digital health applications for migrant health has been growing exponentially since the last years, so new and innovative results are expected to come.</p>
