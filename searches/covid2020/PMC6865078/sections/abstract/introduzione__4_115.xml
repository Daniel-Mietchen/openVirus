  <title>INTRODUZIONE</title>
  <p>Vaccine hesitancy has been traditionally gauged using vaccine uptake and its timeliness and it has been traditionally predicted using socio-demographic variables. While uptake is of paramount importance, vaccine hesitancy is more nuanced, encompassing various levels of doubts about vaccines that parents may have even if they fully vaccinate. 
   <italic>Study 1</italic> aims at assessing the relationship between hesitant behaviour and attitudes.
  </p>
  <p>Additionally, previous studies have rarely considered psychological characteristics of parents that can affect decision-making. 
   <italic>Study 2</italic> aims at filling this gap, exploring the relationship between parents’ emotional competence and attitude towards vaccines.

  <title>MATERIALI E METODI</title>
  <p>In 
   <italic>Study 1</italic>, predictors of hesitant behaviour (having voluntarily postponed/forgone some/all vaccines) were examined in 2,778 parents from the ULSS 6 of the Veneto Region. Predictors included: socio-demographic characteristics and attitudes towards vaccines (measured with a 26-items survey).
  </p>
  <p>In 
   <italic>Study 2</italic>, psychological predictors of the attitude towards vaccine were examined in 593 parents recruited in nurseries and kindergartens in Padova, using the Profile of Emotional Competence, as well as mental images spontaneously associated with the term “vaccine”. All data were collected between December 2016 and May 2017.

  <title>RISULTATI</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Study 1:</italic> Hesitant behaviour was predicted by: younger age of the child; higher education level of parents; the mother being Italian and employed, especially in the health domain; and the father having completed the questionnaire. Attitudes were characterized on three independent factors (extracted through factor analysis) focusing on: 1) concerns for possible side effects of vaccines; 2) concerns for negative effects of illnesses prevented by vaccines; and 3) beliefs in natural protection against illnesses. All three factors independently predicted hesitant behaviour.
  </p>
  <p>
   <italic>Study 2:</italic> A significant mediational analysis showed that parents with higher emotional competences concerning their own emotions, through more positive mental images associated with the word “vaccine”, were more likely to have positive attitudes towards vaccines (lower concerns about side effects, higher concerns about the illnesses prevented by vaccines, and lower beliefs in natural protection against illnesses).

  <title>CONCLUSIONI</title>
  <p>Our results confirm that hesitant behavior is only the tip of the iceberg. Attitudes towards vaccines can be characterized on three correlated but independent dimensions that are highly predictive of hesitant behaviour.</p>
  <p>Our findings also indicate that parents’ intrapersonal emotional competences affect all dimensions of attitudes towards vaccines. Since emotional competences can be taught and learned, future studies could leverage our findings to test the impact of increasing parents’ emotional competences.</p>
