  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
  <p>Fasting can be defined as abstinence or reduction from food, drink, or both, for a defined period. There are many different types of fasting regimens, such as Ramadan fasting, Intermittent fasting, Christian Orthodox fasting. A considerable number of observational and experimental studies tried to demonstrate whether fasting is a secure and valid dieting strategy in order to obtain some benefits against the development of numerous diseases. The aim of this systematic reviews is to provide an overview of the three most practiced forms of fasting regimens (Ramadan fasting, Intermittent fasting, Christian Orthodox fasting), summarize the impact of these interventions on health benefits, and discuss mechanisms by which these regimens might lead to improve health outcomes.</p>

  <title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title>
  <sec>
   <title>Data Sources</title>
   <p>A systematic search was performed on MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, and CINHAL from January 1, 1980 through March 2019. Data were analyzed from April to May 31, 2019.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
   <title>Study selection</title>
   <p>We included systematic reviews of observational and experimental human studies that report on impact of different types of fasting regimens on health.</p>

   <title>Data extraction and synthesis</title>
   <p>Selection of systematic reviews, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken in duplicate. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR tool.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>After screening 3688 article, 21 systematic reviews were selected for full text review and were included for further overview. Only 7 reviews were high quality (AMSTAR class 4), 2 were moderate quality (AMSTAR class 3), 11 were low quality (AMSTAR class 2) and 1 was very low quality (AMSTAR class1).</p>
  <sec>
   <title>Ramadan fasting (13 reviews)</title>
   <p>Reviews on Ramadan fasting reported improvements on lipid profile and weight, uncertain results on incidence of gastrointestinal disorders, increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and protection against urinary infections. Ramadan fasting does not greatly alter the immunological and inflammatory profile and does not generate fetal and maternal risks during pregnancy.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
   <title>Intermittent fasting (6 reviews)</title>
   <p>Reviews on Intermittent fasting reported improvements on weight, BMI, lipid profile. This regimen of fasting might reduce the prevalence of diabetes and coronary heart disease and might improve levels of insulin and of inflammatory markers.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
   <title>Christian Orthodox fasting (2 reviews)</title>
   <p>Reviews on Christian Orthodox fasting reported improvements on BMI, lipid profile and arterial pressure, but at the same time this type of fasting reduces vitamin levels and cause hyperparathyroidism.</p>
  </sec>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>Despite some adverse events, these fasting regimens might represent a valid nonpharmacological approach to improve health outcome, with public health benefits.</p>
