 <p>In recent decades, significant changes have influenced the world of work, as effect of the equally relevant changes that have affected the industrialized countries from an economic and social point of view. The most important aspect is the progressive increase in the average age of the working population (in particular in Italy) related to a higher aging rate of the general population (demographic transition), despite an increase in retirement age, reduction of employment rate and hiring of young people. Presently in Europe, workers aged over 50 years are twice than those under the age of 25; in Italy, in the last twenty years, the workers’ average age has increased by 5 years (from 39 to 44 years). In 2015 the Eurofound report identifies the increase of 16.2% of the working population over 55 by 2030 as an alert, while ISTAT underlines that such aging will be more significant in Italy due to the recent changes to the pension system. Currently in Europe 100 million people suffer from musculoskeletal disorders and pathologies, responsible for more than 50% of absences from work, unsuitability, limitations and permanent unfitness for work. The analysis of the national context on the trend of work-related diseases highlights a progressive increase of these over the last 5 years. In 2017, there were around 58 thousand complaints of occupational diseases (about 2,200 less than in 2016), with an increase of about 25% compared to 2012. The professional cause was identified in 33% of the reported diseases while, as for the type, the musculoskeletal diseases (65.75% of the complaints) rank the highest. The contrast to the spread of chronic diseases, recently promoted by WHO with the 2020 Health Program, is also of particular relevance in terms of occupational health protection, since many of the chronic-degenerative age-related diseases, once they arise, can condition people’s quality of life, progressively and permanently compromising their level of autonomy and work capacity, strongly affecting the system productivity. The repercussions observed in terms of employment can be different: reduced productivity, absence due to illness, demotion, interruption of the employment relationship which, depending on the case, can be an early retirement, a recognition of disability indemnified by the government, or even a dismissal. Healthcare is one of the labor fields most involved in the phenomenon of the increased incidence of work-related diseases, mainly connected with exposure to risk factors due to biomechanical overload (disorders and pathologies of the musculoskeletal system) and psycho-social discomfort (work distress, burn-out, etc.) and work-related stress. An interesting element of reflection at national level is represented by the study on the phenomenon of personnel limitations in healthcare companies (HC) (CERGAS of Bocconi University, 2015). The national data showed percentage values that range between 10.70% of the territorial companies and 22.60% of the IRCCS (total value of the invalidity equal to 11.8%) of the total amount of the workforce, which corresponds to a total of 16,266 people with impairments. As the research has clearly confirmed a strong relationship between work restrictions and workers age, it is essential that all health authorities take this aspect into consideration in order to systematically address their policies by the application of the management models of “disabilities”. On the basis of consolidated international experiences, it is possible to apply the Disability Management (DM) model to the company system, without disregarding the active participation of all the key figures of occupational prevention and in particular the managerial function of the Occupational Medicine. The term DM refers to a model theorized in the 1980s, initially developed in North America and Europe, which today is still poorly applied in Italy, aimed at reducing the impact of invalidity (deriving from disability, illness or accident) on the individuals’ capability to effectively carry out their work activities. The DM model has been developed with the aim of matching the productive interests of the company with the needs of disabled or sick workers to find a job that satisfies them, not only in economic terms, but also on a human and social level. In fact, DM intends to offer support to employees suffering from chronic illnesses or disabilities in order to optimize their professional performance, limiting the negative effects of the disease on their activity, through a global, coherent and progressive approach implemented by the company. On an international level, DM is widely used in the public field, such as, for example, in the Canadian government, where this method is implemented to prevent and manage absences from work due to illness or injury, with tools such as sick leave, but also planning of benefits and adjustments of professional duties when returning to work. The possibility for the workers to be assigned a different duty, in order to work to the best of their abilities, besides being a shared value, in this country is a legal obligation. The professional profile responsible for the overall process of the socio-working integration of people with disabilities, in charge of planning, research and selection, insertion and retention in the company, up to the professional and organizational development, is known as 
  <italic>Disability Manager</italic>. Its origin has to be considered within the Public Administration in which, especially within the Italian Municipalities, it finds its specific location. In comparison with countries in which this professional profile has existed for the past 30 years, the Lombardia Region has recently recognized the professional profile of the 
  <italic>Disability Manager</italic> (Regional Decree No. 2922 of March 1, 2018). Beyond the regulatory evolution and the recognition of professionalism, the Disability Manager profile has already been introduced in several large companies that have by now many years of experience in the field. In the health field there are also different experiences carried out in some hospitals, i.e. health agencies such as the Local Health Unit 4 of eastern Veneto and private companies. In this regard, the experience and the company role of the competent physician make her/him as one of the most authoritative candidates to hold such position within the companies.

 <p>A DM program started in 2011 within IRCCS Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital, which serves as a national and international reference for its clinical excellence and translational research. In this context, the distribution of work restrictions by risk factor highlights how the main causes are the ergonomic factors and the organizational risks, on which the main preventive actions have been focused. In fact, the improvement actions have concentrated on limiting the risk from biomechanical overload/manual patient movement (MPM) and on the activities necessary for the organizational well-being. In this regard, health and safety promotion initiatives have been implemented together with the Health Department (HD) (ad example, food education courses, on-the-job training on correct maneuvers in the MPM, anti-flu vaccination campaign). Occupational Medicine (OM) has collaborated in developing proposals for the ergonomic requalification of spaces (ceiling lifts, robotization systems for drugs preparation, corporate back school, etc.). Furthermore, in 2011 an ad hoc Working Group (WG) was set-up starting managing the so-called “difficult suitability”, with the aim of replacing the cases with limitation and, at the same time, identifying the “full” suitability for the assigned task. The WG, coordinated by the Head of OM, is constituted by competent physicians, members of Human Resources (HR) Department and the HD; it meets periodically on a monthly basis. During the last two years, through DM programs, 700 assessments have been carried for about 150 workers (5% of health personnel), mostly women (about 90%) with an average age of 50 years; 77.8% of workers are nurses. In accordance with the national case law on reporting of occupational diseases, the cases dealt with regarded three categories: 1) cases of biomechanical overload with musculoskeletal pathology (38.2%); 2) other problems linked to the presence of serious pathologies, especially neoplasms (35%); 3) cases of working and non-working discomfort, especially of a psychological nature, linked with work-related stress conditions (26.8% of the cases). An evaluation of the program effectiveness was carried out by verifying the number of job limitations registered among the hospital workers: from the systematic review of health surveillance data collected between 2015 and 2018 after the program introduction, the job limitations are lower (present a lower trend) (5.5% of personnel) compared to the national benchmark relative to the HC (10.70-22.60%).</p>
 <p>Still in the DM ambit, in consideration of the general reduction of the vaccination coverage in the population in Italy with a progressive increase in antibiotic resistance and nosocomial infections, as well as a strong increase in the illness related absences of health workers due to diseases transmissible, including mainly the flu, the University Hospital “A. Gemelli” IRCCS, a national and international reference point for personalized medicine and innovative biotechnology, since 2014 implemented a strategy to fight hospital infections and flu transmission, through a facilitated company path for personnel vaccination, as well as a nutritional program for the prevention of related diseases. The competent physician and hygienist have a key role in a multi-infections disciplinary stewardship strategy (MIDs Model) which involved structuring specific vaccination campaigns and integrated surveillance/control strategies. Such strategy allowed to improve the vaccination coverage (for example for flue) of the health staff from only 2% (between 55% for physicians and only 25% for nurses) to over 25.4% in only 4 years (with an increase for physicians of 31% and 68.9% for nurses) with an implementation of the disability management model with on-site training and vaccination (with an improvement of 72.1%, compared to the national benchmark of national health services, and a reduction of absence due to illness of 1.6 days, as well as a € 95.0 reduction in costs for the company, for each health worker).</p>
 <p>In conclusion, the experience carried out over the years within the two IRCCS has led to the development of a protocol, structured according to the DM model, with the management’s consent as a “company good practice”. Redefinition and recoding of the key steps of the DM process and evaluation of the results achieved, also through the analysis of key indicators, such as pre-post-illness absence, is contributing to the implementation of the model. This will allow a review of the DM model to be proposed within the Italian healthcare organizations. Further development of the protocol should include the introduction of the professional profile of the Disability Manager as responsible for the entire program.</p>
