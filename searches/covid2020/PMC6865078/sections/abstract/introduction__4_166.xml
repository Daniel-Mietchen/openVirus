  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Immunization is among the most successful and cost-effective public health measures. However, nowadays there is still quite unawareness and a heated public debate surrounding vaccination. Over the last years, vaccination opponents have gained increasingly popularity on the web disseminating misinformation that negatively affected health policies. The “VaccinarSì” project was launched in May 2013 by the Società Italiana di Igiena (SItI). It is a web portal created in order to spread scientific information about vaccination through several supports (scientific articles, paper-based tools, videos and newsletters). The main objective of our study was to characterize the portal connections to get an overview of the “VaccinarSì” website popularity. We also aimed at identifying potential indicators to better assess its effectiveness as a public health tool.</p>

  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p>Using the Google Analytics dataset, we investigated the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the connections to the “VaccinarSì” website from May 2013 to May 2019. Descriptive analysis of the connections to the national VaccinarSì portal and of the regional portals were made. The demographic indications were obtained through heuristic investigations based on data extrapolated from Google Analytics since November 2015.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>The web portal provides over one hundred webpages about different topics concerning vaccination. The visibility of the website is clear: it is on top position among organic Google search results when using the keyword “VaccinarSì”. In 2019, about 70.000 visits per month have been registered and over 1000 locations accessed to the portal showing a satisfying geographical diffusion. The mean duration of each session on the website is 1 min 18 sec (quite shorter compared to the mean duration in 2013: 2 min 41 sec), mean pages visited for each session fell from 2.93 to 1.67 with a bounce rate over 80%. Amongst the users, 72% are women aged between 25 to 44 years and the website is mostly visited during work hours. Most of the accesses to the portal are performed directly to a specific webpage achieved by Google (52%) and only 3% of visitors access it through social media.</p>

  <title>DISCUSSION</title>
  <p>Connections data related to “VaccinarSì” website are encouraging. However, some quantitative parameters suggest that briefer articles and more interactive tools might improve the website availability, thus making it more appealing and user-friendly also for general population. Finally, it seems important to enhance the presence on social platforms to further disseminate on the web science-based information and disprove fake news about vaccination.</p>
