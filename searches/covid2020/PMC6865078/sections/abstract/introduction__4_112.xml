  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>The Veneto Region has been invested with an environmental pollution resulting in a large and heavy episode of human exposure. The paper proposes a method for measuring the health benefits expected from reducing the contamination of drinking water and food matrices.</p>

  <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
  <p>An explanatory serum PFOA concentration of 30 ng/mL was chosen as reference, corresponding to a 7% increase in total cholesterol and a consequent increase in cardiovascular risk in adults over 40 years (EFSA December 2018 Scientific Opinion:BMDL5: 9.4 ng/mL).</p>
  <p>A baseline serum PFOA concentration of 46 ng/mL was considered (taking the median value measured among the participants to the Regional Health Surveillance Plan) to describe the substance clearance in response to different realistic scenarios of contamination of drinking water and raw food. A simplified one-compartment pharmacokinetic model, was used (half-life 2.3 years, distribution volume 0.17 ml/kg body weight, lactating women), according to USEPA 2016.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>An individual with a serum PFOA concentration of 46 ng/mL reaches the reference level of 30 ng/mL after 1.8 years if he drinks water with PFOA 10 ng/mL and after 2.8 years if he drinks water with PFOA 40 ng/L. The PFOA concentrations measured in some private wells used for drinking water are in the order of magnitude of hundreds/thousands ng/L.</p>
  <p>As for raw food consumption, the reference PFOA serum level of 30 ng/mL is reached after about 1.8 and 3.3 years, when the corresponding food daily intake is 0.35 and 2.30 ng/kg-day ng/Kg body weight-day (lower and upper bound estimates of mean intake among adults, Italy 2005-2006), In a high-exposure scenario the latter intake may be reached and exceeded.</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>The outlined scenarios can be of help to esteem the health benefits resulting from the installation of activate carbon drinking water filtering systems (2013) and to identify situations of possible interest for further actions of environmental,agri-food, dietary and drinking water supply mitigation. A more accurate esteem requires accurate, detailed and updated local exposure data; for example; the robustness and reliability of the measurement of the daily PFOA food intake largely depends on the study design (market basket, duplicate diet), the sampling representativity and the analytic threshold.</p>
  <p>Finally, the decay curves are critically influenced by the baseline level, the target serum PFOA concentration of interest for human health and the pharmacokinetic model considered: for example, in a recent case study from Sweden, the PFOA half-life is longer.</p>
