  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
  <p>Bioactive food compounds can affect global DNA methylation, which in turn is negatively associated with chromosomal instability and genome function. Since diet is characterized by a mixture of foods, we aimed to identify dietary patterns in women, and to evaluate their effect on Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINE-1) methylation, a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation.</p>

  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p>We conducted a cross-sectional study of 349 women from Southern Italy, with no history of severe diseases. Dietary patterns were derived by Food Frequency Questionnaire and Principal Component Analysis. LINE-1 methylation of leukocyte DNA was assessed by pyrosequencing.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>We observed that intake of wholemeal bread, cereals, olive oil, eggs, fish, fruit, vegetables, legumes, soup, potatoes, fries, rice, pasta and pizza positively correlated with LINE-1 methylation. By contrast, butter and margarine, vegetable oil, dipping sauces, and coffee negatively correlated with LINE-1 methylation. Next, we demonstrated that adherence to the prudent dietary pattern – characterized by high intake of potatoes, cooked and raw vegetables, legumes, soup and fish – was positively associated with LINE-1 methylation. Particularly, women in the 3rd tertile exhibited higher LINE-1 methylation level than those in the 1st tertile (median = 66.7% 5mC; IQR = 4.67% 5mC vs median = 63.1% 5mC; IQR = 12.3% 5mC; p &lt; 0.001). Linear regression confirmed that women in the 3
   <sup>rd</sup> tertile had higher LINE-1 methylation that those in the 1st tertile (β = 1.765; SE = 0.728; p = 0.016), after adjusting for age, educational level, use of folic acid supplement and total energy intake. By contrast, no differences in LINE-1 methylation across tertiles of adherence to the western dietary pattern were evident.

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>Our study demonstrated a remarkable link between diet and DNA methylation, suggesting LINE-1 methylation as a molecular mechanisms underpinning the protective effect of prudent dietary pattern in healthy women.</p>
