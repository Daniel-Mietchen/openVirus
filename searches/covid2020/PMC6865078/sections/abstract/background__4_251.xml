  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
  <p>Eating disorders (EDs) are a severely impairing group of mental disorders resulting in burdens for families, caregivers and society, accounting for more than 2.2% of the global disease burden. EDs are mostly diagnosed in late adolescence, but their onset might start earlier with behaviors like emotional overeating (EO) and restrained eating (RE), characterized by restrictive behaviors, body dissatisfaction, compensation methods, eating in response to disturbed affect regulation.</p>
  <p>Moreover, a wide range of adverse life events are recognized risk factors for EDs, but their association with childhood eating behaviors has been less explored. Our aim was to examine whether a wide range of life events can predict emotional eating and restrained eating in childhood, which are potential precursors of EDs.</p>

  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p>The study is embedded in Generation R, a prospective population-based cohort. Final sample included 4653 children aged 10 years. EO was assessed with the Children’s Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and RE with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Mothers reported the occurrence of 24 adverse events in their offspring’s childhood. Regression analyses were conducted, both unadjusted and adjusted for gender, ethnicity, and parental education and psychopathology.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>Unadjusted models showed that a higher number of life events is associated with more EO (B = 0.07, 95%CI 0.04-0.09) and RE (B = 0.04, 95%CI 0.02-0.06), while in the adjusted model results were B = 0.05, 95%CI 0.02-0.08 for EO and B = 0.04, 95%CI 0.02-0.07 for RE. Subjects who experienced 2 life events displayed higher EO and RE (B = 0.14, 95%CI 0.03-0.24 and B = 0.10, 95%CI – 0.004-0.20 respectively) in unadjusted models. Those who experienced at least 3 life events showed higher EO and RE in both unadjusted (B = 0.26, 95%CI 0.15-0.37 and B = 0.18, 95%CI 0.07-0.29 respectively) and adjusted model (B = 0.2, 95%CI 0.06-0.33 and B = 0.21, 95%CI 0.08-0.33 respectively).</p>
  <p>Maltreatment related life events showed a non-significant but substantial association for EO (B = 0.14, 95%CI – 0.02-0.30).</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>This is the first population-based study showing an association of the experience of adverse events during childhood and the presence of disordered eating behaviors (EO and RE) at age 10. The associations are stronger when more events were experienced, suggesting an increasing influence.</p>
  <p>Stressful events may be potential risk factors for the development of deviations in eating behaviors in children. Therefore, if the studied eating behaviors are indeed precursors of EDs, these findings could offer potential for prevention and early intervention to avoid the development of full-blown EDs.</p>
