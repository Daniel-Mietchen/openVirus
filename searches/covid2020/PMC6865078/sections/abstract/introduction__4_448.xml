  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Invasive bacterial disease (IBD) occur when there is the assessed presence of bacteria in a usually sterile fluid. The most common bacteria causing IBD are 
   <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, 
   <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and 
   <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, the diffusion occurs through contact with diseased individuals or healthy carriers.
  </p>
  <p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological trends of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in patients admitted to the IRCSS San Matteo Hospital Foundation from January 2012 until December 2018 and to compare them to National and Regional trends; the aim was also to implement the hospitalâ€™s role in identifying and vaccinating subjects belonging to categories at risk. Vaccination status of the patients and antibiotic susceptibilities of the pneumococcal strains were analyzed.</p>

  <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
  <p>We retrospectively enrolled patients admitted to our hospital between January 2012 and December 2018, with a microbiologically proven diagnosis of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease, and whose biological specimen had been processed in the Laboratory of Microbiology and Virology of Foundation.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>A total of 143 patients were included in our study. The 80% of the strains were isolated from blood (115 cases), 7% from CSF (10 cases) and a 13% from both (18 cases). The most common clinical pictures were of bacteremia and sepsis. There is a constant trend of infection over the years: 19 cases of IPD in 2012, 18 in 2013, a low number of cases in 2014(8), while a constant increase over the last few years. Results showed an increase in the trend of invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) over the last years and a seasonality trend as the disease is most common in colder months. Elderly people are the most affected by the disease, with an increased mortality risk. The most common circulating serotypes in our hospitals were serotypes 3, 8 and 14. 76% of the patients were not vaccinated, and at least 43% of the diseases could have been prevented with vaccinations.</p>
  <p>Erythromycin, Azithromycin, Clarithromycin and Tetracycline showed the highest trends in resistances, while pneumococcal strains were always susceptible to Vancomycin, Imipenem, Meropenem and Teicoplanin.</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>IPD cases have increased over the last few years. It is important to continue monitoring the trends of the disease and to promote immunization campaigns, especially in the elderlies and in individuals with comorbidities. 67% IPD cases could be prevented with vaccination, so new vaccination strategies are essential to include more serotypes in the vaccines and to improve the important role of the hospital.</p>
