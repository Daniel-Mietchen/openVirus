  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Measles is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease. Preliminary global data shows that reported cases rose by 300 percent globally in the first three months of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. According to WHO, in Europe the prevalence of measles infections is at its highest rate in a decade: 82,596 people were infected and 72 died from the preventable disease during 2018. Interestingly, over 92 per cent of the reported cases were present in just 10 countries with Ukraine having the highest number and Albania with almost 1,500 cases.</p>
  <p>This study investigated measles’ awareness and vaccination status among first year in Albanian, Italian and others origin University students. Healthcare students were involved because of they’re at risk of contracting and transmitting measles and should get appropriate vaccines to reduce this chance.</p>

  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p>An anonymous questionnaire was filled by 315 healthcare students (71.4% women, mean age 20.1 ± 3.3) from the Catholic University “Our Lady of Good Counsel” in Tirana (Albania)
   <italic>.</italic> The questionnaire included demographic information; vaccination status; opinion about vaccine’s safety; questions concerning knowledge about measles disease and vaccination. An overall score was generated for each respondent (one point for correct response, maximum score 9). Data were extracted and analyzed using SPSS v.21.

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>The students attended Medicine (31.4%), Physiotherapy (22.9%), Dentistry (22.9%), Pharmacy (8.6%) and Nursing (14.3%). 69.1% of the sample reported to be vaccinated against measles. The mean score about measles’ knowledge was 2.9 ± 1.8; medical and pharmacy students had highest mean knowledge scores (3.00 ± 1.8 and 3.80 ± 2.2 respectively, p &lt; 0.05). Only 49.9% of the sample was aware of measles’s dangerousness. Concerning the question “Measles vaccine could be a risk for your health?” 11.1% gave an affirmative answer and 41.6% gave an uncertain one. 50.2% of the students doubted about measles vaccine’s efficacy and 48.5% believed that measles vaccine could cause autism. Nursing, Physiotherapy and Dentistry students had a higher risk to believe about vaccine-autism correlation vs Pharmacy and Medicine students (OR 3.2, CI 2.02-5.20, p &lt; 0.001).</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>Results highlighted that students didn’t consider measles a serious disease. The survey showed that misconceptions remain about both the measles’s vaccine safety and perceptions of risk/benefit of the vaccine. Healthcare students need to acquire knowledge and awareness on measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. It is important to have positive attitudes toward vaccination and to reduce hesitancy because of these students will play an important role in the future of public health.</p>
