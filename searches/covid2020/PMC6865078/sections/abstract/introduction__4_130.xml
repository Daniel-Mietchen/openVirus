  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>The new EU joint action “Preparedness and action at points of entry” acronym HEALTHY GATEWAYS (started May 2018: duration 36 months) consists of 37 authorities (including Italian Ministry of Health and Istituto Superiore di Sanità) from 29 European countries and Taiwan. The Advisory Board includes representatives from DG SANTE, CHAFEA, ECDC, WHO, CAPSCA. This action builds on the previous EU SHIPSAN ACT joint action (2013-2016) and AIRSAN project.</p>

  <title>AIM</title>
  <p>The aim is to support cooperation and coordinated action of EUMS to improve their capacities at points of entry (airports, ports, ground-crossings) in preventing and combating cross-border health threats from the transport sector. The action activities include the following: a) facilitating EU MS evaluating and monitoring of core capacities at PoE; b) strengthening inter sectoral and cross sectoral collaboration through a communication network; c) producing catalogues of tested best practices, guidelines and validated action plans; d) providing capacity building/training on tested best practices, guidelines, validated action plans; e) facilitating EU MSs coordinating and executing hygiene inspections on conveyances; f) combatting all types of health threats focusing on infectious disease and vectors; g) supporting response to possible future public health emergencies of international concern.</p>
  <p>In future public health emergencies, the action will move from interepidemic mode to emergency mode, supporting coherent response as per Decision n°1082/2013/EU, International Health Regulations and WHO temporary recommendations.</p>
