  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Vaccine hesitancy (VH) is a complex and country-specific issue, responsible for the decreasing vaccination rate and subsequent spread of vaccine-preventable diseases. In literature, several questionnaires were developed to assess VH. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the published questionnaires assessing parental VH.</p>

  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p>The search was conducted in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library, in December 2017, following the PRISMA guidelines. The search strategy included 4 types of keywords: parents, vaccine hesitancy/acceptance, immunization and survey. Only English and Italian original papers were included. 17 reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts. Only the included articles were downloaded in full and, after a second screening, data were extracted and recorded in an ad hoc spreadsheet.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>A total of 5,139 articles were retrieved, after duplicates elimination 3,944 papers were screened. After a screening selection, 337 studies were included in the analysis. Most studies were cross-sectional (92.9%), followed by case-control (4.8%) and cohort studies (2.4%). The population interviewed was mainly parents, without any further details (73.3%); mothers were the only parent surveyed in approximately 20% of the studies, while only 1 study involved selectively the fathers. The sample size ranged from 7 to 59,897. Only 38% of the included studies reported both the number and type of items used. Regarding the type, more than half consisted of closed questions, followed by Likert scales, while open-ended questions were used in 14.8% of the surveys. Frequently, the survey was conducted using a self-reported questionnaire or interview. The questionnaires were mostly administered on paper, while online forms were used in 13.7% of the cases. However, 79.8% of the questionnaires were not attached to the paper. HPV vaccine was the most frequently investigated (39.2%), followed by influenza (13.4%) and measles (10.7%). While 22.6% of the articles referred to paediatrics vaccinations in general. Data about the immunization behaviours were reported in 297 studies: the subjects involved showed a behaviour defined as “acceptance” in 130 studies (38.6%), as “hesitancy/scepticism/doubt” in 145 studies (43%) and as “refusal” in 22 studies (6.5%). This information was not reported in 11.9% of the studies.</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>VH is still a public health challenge, as confirmed by the high number of studies and questionnaires retrieved. This study offers a deeper perspective on the available questionnaires, helping to identify the best one in terms of aim and study setting.</p>
