  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>We retrospectively analysed vital statistics data to evaluate any potential effect on pregnancies at different gestational ages of pollutants emitted by a multi-site arson of the largest Sicilian solid waste management plant occurred in July 2012.</p>

  <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
  <p>The study group comprised 551 births of both born alive and non-alive children from pregnancies of mothers residing in the extra-urbanexposed area, conceived during a 40-week period during which the highest peak of the fire might has influenced a pregnancy. We compared birth outcomes (gestational age &lt; 37 and &lt; 32 weeks, low birth weight, very low birth weight and small for gestational age) of the study group with those of a reference group of women residing in areas of Sicily with similarly low population density and industrial development.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>Among singleton live births we observed a three-fold increase in risk of very preterm birth between the extra-urban area and the remaining low inhabitants density and unindustrialized areas for births whose pregnancies were in the third trimester (OR adjusted for maternal age and infant gender = 3.41; 95%CI = 1.04-11.16). There was an excess of very low birth weight singleton infants in the study group as compared to the reference group, which was limited to births of mothers exposed during peri-conception period (OR adjusted for maternal age and infant gender = 4.64; 95%CI = 1.04-20.6) and first trimester (OR adjusted for maternal age and infant gender = 3.66; 95%CI = 1.11-12.1). The association estimates were imprecise due to the small number of outcomes recorded.</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>The study documented an excess of very preterm and very low birth weight among infants born to mothers exposed to the landfill fire emissions during conception or early pregnancy. The retrospective design and the limited vital statistics data available for analysis did not allow a detailed assessment of the longitudinal nature of the exposure-response relation, nor a precise adjustment for potential confounding.</p>
  <p>The study added to the growing body of evidence that exposure to pollutants emitted from solid waste landfills may have serious health effects and underscores the need for monitoring potential hazards and health outcomes in the population living near landfills.</p>
