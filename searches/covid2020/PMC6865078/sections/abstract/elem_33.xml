 <p>Epidemiological evidence shows that individuals who maintain a lifestyle with high mobility and physical activity have a remarkably lower risk of noncommunicable diseases, with a reduction of all-cause mortality. Regarding the association between physical inactivity and cancer incidence, in a recent meta-analysis including 12 prospective cohort studies with 1.44 million participants, leisure-time physical activity in relation to risk of 26 different cancer types has been examined

   <xref rid="art034_ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
  </sup>; the study showed that increasing levels of leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risks of 13 of the 26 cancers investigated, regardless of body size and smoking history.
 </p>
 <p>Moreover, several studies suggest that exposure to exercise following the diagnosis of certain solid tumors might lower the progression of the disease and reduce cancer-related mortality

  </sup>. These findings open to new approaches in the methodologies for cancer progression control, introducing the exercise-oncology field.

 <p>Recently, Hojman and colleagues 
  <sup>
   <xref rid="art034_ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
  </sup> reviewed the current molecular evidence about the effect of exercise on cancer. The authors describe the role of exercise in controlling cancer progression through a direct effect on tumor intrinsic factors and the interplay with whole-body exercise effects. The tumor growth-inhibitory effects could be mediated by several different mechanisms, such as the release of several systemic factors (
  <italic>i.e.</italic>, catecholamines, myokines, etc.) and sympathetic activation, modulated during the exercise performance. The acute effect of a single exercise bouts leads to intratumoral adaptations, contributing to slower tumor progression. Moreover, growth factors such as insulin and IGFs stimulate cancer cell proliferation through the activation of their respective receptor tyrosine kinases, which trigger the major signal transduction pathways (e.g. PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways)

  </sup>. Chronic exercise reduces growth factor availability in the systemic milieu, and presumably in the tumor microenvironment, induced by prolonged physical inactivity

  </sup>.
 </p>
 <p>Our research group is currently evaluating if the systemic response to a high-intensity endurance cycling (HIEC) test session could modulate the proliferation and the tumorigenic potential of breast or prostate cancer cells, 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>. The study design includes the use of serum samples collected before, immediately after, and after 2 and 24 hours the exercise bouts. Serum samples were then been used in cell culture assays to evaluate cell proliferation and colony formation in a three-dimensional cell growth assay: three-dimensional anchorage-independent growth assay in soft agar is a model used to evaluate malignant cell growth and it is considered a good hallmark of tumorigenesis.
 </p>
 <p>In a first pilot study, blood samples of 12 healthy and sedentary females have been collected before the HIEC sessions exercise (t0, at rest), immediately after (t1), 2-hours and 24-hours post (t2 and t3, respectively) and used to supplement the culture media of cells. Our results showed that immediately-after HIEC and the 2-hours post (t1 and t2) sera markedly reduced cell proliferation capacity of triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC), in comparison to that revealed in cells cultured with t0 sera. Moreover, the capacity of post-exercise-conditioned sera to induce tumorigenesis in soft agar was significantly lower in comparison to that revealed in cells cultured with t0 sera.</p>
 <p>These encouraging results lead us to apply this model in women with a history of breast cancer. In collaboration with the OU of Oncology, “Santa Maria della Misericordia” hospital of Urbino, we are starting a project entitled “Movimento e Salute oltre la Cura” (Movement and Health beyond Care), MoviS (CESU approved n. 21, 10
  <sup>th</sup> July 2019). The general objective of the project MoviS is to improve the quality of life (QoL) of breast cancer survivors (BCS). This proposal stems from the need to respond to the requests of numerous women with a history of breast cancer, which perceive their lifestyle as unhealthy but lack the necessary tools to move towards a correct diet and regular physical activity. The strongest evidence regarding lifestyle changes and cancer risk comes from the link with obesity; however, there is significant evidence that physical inactivity 
  <italic>per se</italic> increases the risk of cancer and relapse regardless of body weight.
 </p>
 <p>Throughout the planned trial period, the food plan will be prescribed by the nutritionists of the IRCCS National 
  <italic>Cancer Institute</italic> (INT) 
  <italic>Milan</italic> following the guidelines indicated in the 
  <italic>DianaWeb</italic> project 
  <sup>
   <xref rid="art034_ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
  </sup>, based on the recommendations of the WCRF 2018 and on the Mediterranean diet. The exercise protocols will be designed according to the most recent internationally recognized guidelines for the prescription of physical activity with health and preventive purposes in cancer patients 
  <sup>
   <xref rid="art034_ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
  </sup>, which are perfectly in line with the Italian guidelines on physical activity for these patients, recently published by the Ministry of Health. During the intermediate follow-up, various parameters will be evaluated, such as the QoL, the reduction of the ‘fatigue’, the reduction of body weight and the modifications induced on the relevant metabolic and clinical parameters in order to verify the beneficial effects of the prescribed exercise
 </p>
 <p>Within this project, we planned to collect serum samples before and after exercise sessions and use them in cell growth assays, in order to verify and quantify the efficacy of exercise in the inhibition of cell proliferation and tumorigenicity.</p>
 <p>Overall, the positive effects of the exercise-oncology on cancer progression control recently gained attention. Despite the anticancer component released in response to an acute exercise have not been fully understood, there is growing evidence that acute systemic changes can control cancer cell viability and proliferation.</p>
 <p>To move forward in the translational development of the use of precise exercise for cancer treatment, there is a need of additional studies on preclinical testing, preliminary safety, and efficacy trials, and definitive clinical exercise trials with survival endpoints 
  <sup>

  </sup>, with the aim of a controlled and personalized administration of acute exercise bouts by exercise experts.
