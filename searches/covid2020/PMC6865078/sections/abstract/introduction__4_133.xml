  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) point prevalence surveys (PPS), repeated periodically, provide an effective epidemiological tool for evaluations of preventive and control strategies. Objectives of the present work are: (I) to estimate HAI prevalence and antimicrobial use prevalence; (II) to describe the characteristics of patients and HAIs, (III) to evaluate for HAI risk of factors</p>

  <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
  <p>During February-April of 6 consecutive years (2014-2019), and in November 2016, we conducted 7 PPS adopting the “
   <italic>Point prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals</italic>” protocol by European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Versions 4.3-5.3, at the 1300 acute-care beds San Martino Policlinic Hospital, a teaching hospital located in Genoa, North-West Italy. Chi square for linear trend was used to describe the prevalence trends and multivariate linear regression was used to assess risk of factor for HAI insurgence.

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>Overall, 6499 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 72 years (IQR: 57-81), a male:female ratio = 0.99:1 and a median HAI onset time of 15 days (IQR: 7-29). 50.0% of the patient had a Non-fatal McCabe score; 31.2% had an ultimately-fatal, 17.1% had a rapidly-fatal and 2.7% had an Unknown score.</p>
  <p>HAI prevalence resulted 15.5% in 2014, 16.27% in 2015, 13.24% in 2016 (I),13.73% in 2016 (II), 14.12% in 2018 and 11.22% in 2019 with a decreasing trend (p &lt; 0.01).</p>
  <p>Despise antibiotic therapy prevalence varied very little over the years, resulting 46.2% overall the study period, the prevalence of use of carbapenems (J01DH) and fluoroquinolones (J01MA) decerased while penicillins plus beta-lactamase inhibitors (J01CR) increased (p &lt; 0.01).</p>
  <p>Overall, bloodstream and low-respiratory tract infections were the most frequent HAI with a prevalence of 22.4% and 19.3% respectively. 
   <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (12.4%) 
   <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (12.0%) and 
   <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (10.0%) were the most frequent microorganisms isolated in bloodstream infections.
  </p>
  <p>In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, ultimately or rapid McCabe score, surgery, hospitalization in intensive care unit, central line catheter use and urinary catheter use were associated with a higher risk of developing an HAI (p &lt; 0.01).</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>The repeated use over time of the PPS protocol has allowed us to promote greater attention in the matters to the staff of all departments subject of the study, to assess both the effects of the different strategies adopted to control HAI onset and the improved appropriateness of antibiotic prescription.</p>
