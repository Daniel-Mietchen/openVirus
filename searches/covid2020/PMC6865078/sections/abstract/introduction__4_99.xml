  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Recommendations in many countries, such as the United Kingdom, United States, Australia and Italy state that infants with a history of prematurity should receive routine immunization according to the same schedule used for full-term infants, based on their chronological age rather than corrected gestational age and regardless of their birth weight. While several studies are available in term-born infants, data regarding vaccine safety and tolerability in preterm infants are limited, particularly after the schedule 2 + 1 for the hexavalent vaccines. After more than two yearsâ€™ use, we conducted a post-marketing surveillance of the DTaP2-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine safety in infants born with a history of prematurity in Apulia in 2017.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>To identify preterm infants, we extracted the hospital discharge records of infants born between January-June 2017, using the ICD-9-CM codes. We included in the study all preterm infants with a positive cross-matching with records included in the Apulian Immunization Information System. To investigate adverse events (AEs) after the first dose, we interviewed via phone the parents of preterm infants vaccinated with at least one dose of the DTaP2-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine. AEs frequencies with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated and compared to those reported for term-born infants in the Summary of Product Characteristics.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>In Apulia, a total of 866 preterm infants out of 936 (92.5%) received the first dose of hexavalent vaccine and 57.6% were vaccinated by the 3rd month of age as recommended. Out of 866, 80.8% received the DTaP2-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine. We interviewed the parents of 339 preterm infants vaccinated with the DTaP2-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine, 97.8% of whom received co-administration with PCV13 and 72.5% also with anti-rotavirus. The most common local reactions were: pain (35.7%, 95%CI: 30.7-41%), redness (27.1%, 95%CI: 22.6-32.1%) and swelling (26.5%, 95%CI: 22.1-31.5). As for systemic AEs: irritability (27.4%, 95%CI: 22.9-32.4%), fever (22.4%, 95%CI:18.3-27.2%) and somnolence (16.2%, 95%CI: 12.6-20.6%). No serious AEs were reported. Compared to the expected frequency of AEs in term-born infants, in our preterm population the injection site induration, nodule and the rash were more frequent, while loss of appetite, vomiting and persistent crying were less frequent.</p>

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>Our surveillance study showed that over 40% of infants with a history of prematurity received delayed hexavalent vaccination. The AEs to the DTaP2-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine were mainly local or mild. Preliminary results confirm the safety of this hexavalent vaccine also in preterm population. Further studies are needed in this respect, especially regarding the 2 + 1 schedule.</p>
