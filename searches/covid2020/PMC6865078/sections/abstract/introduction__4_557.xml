  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with an increasing incidence over the past decades. This is accompanied by decreasing mortality rate, which results in a growing number of survivors, especially in developed countries. Women with breast cancer diagnosis represent an important target population for public health strategies, aiming to improve their quality of life (QoL). In this scenario, the promotion of healthy diet and physical activity could determine beneficial effects and reduce the risk of recurrence and death. Here, we first performed a cross-sectional analysis to explore the association between diet and QoL among breast cancer survivors. To solve existing controversies, we also carried out a systematic review of observational and experimental studies.</p>

  <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
  <p>We used data from 69 Italian women with a history of stage I-III breast cancer diagnosis who underwent surgery. The recruitment was supported by A.N.D.O.S. Onlus. Adherence to Mediterranean diet (MD) was evaluated by the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Assessment Tool. QoL was assessed using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Quality of Life Questionnaire Breast Cancer Module 23 (QLQ-BR23). Next, a literature search was conducted in the PubMed-Medline and Web of Science databases using the following terms: “Breast Cancer” AND “Quality of Life” AND “Diet”.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>We first pointed out controversial results in the associations of typical MD food categories and QoL: some MD recommendations (e.g. less than 1 serving of red meat per day or drinking 1 glass of wine per day) exhibited a positive effect, while others (e.g. using olive oil as main culinary fat or consuming 3 or more fish servings per week) reduced the QoL. In line with these findings, no differences in QoL across categories of adherence to MD were evident. Evidence from observational studies sustained the debate on the effect of diet on QoL in breast cancer survivors. However, some experimental studies suggested the improvement of QoL – especially in terms of physical and mental functioning – in women who completed healthy diet interventions.</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>Although the promotion of healthy diet might ameliorate the QoL among breast cancer survivors, there is current debate on the effects of typical MD foods and MD in general. Thus, further research is warranted to develop effective interventions towards improved QoL.</p>
