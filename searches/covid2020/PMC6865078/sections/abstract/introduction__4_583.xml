  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>In contemporary society a growing number of activities take place 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This interferes with the possibility of respecting the sleep-wake cycle regulated by the circadian biological clock. The consequent phase shift induces a reduced quantity and quality of sleep which in turn interferes with well-being and health. Sleep disorders and symptoms of reduced duration or quality of sleep can have significant socio-health consequences. The aim of the study is to identify the links between sleep and well-being, in order to propose targeted methods of promoting sleep health.</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>Based on what has been documented in the literature, a program to promote sleep health has been developed for a group of workers at high risk of developing sleep symptoms and their consequences. The workplace sleep health promotion program, including training courses and self-managed improvements of sleep hygiene, such as naps and other sleepiness countermeasures, is currently being implemented in a high-stress risk population, a flying column of police officers.</p>
