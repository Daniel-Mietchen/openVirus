  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Previous studies have shown a reciprocal association between physical activity (PA) and sedentary time (ST) and depression. However, little is known about the hourly distribution of ST and PA in relation to depression. This study assesses the association of the hourly pattern of PA and ST on weekdays and weekend days with prevalent and incident depression over four years of follow-up.</p>

  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p>We used data from 2,124 participants of the Maastricht Study, a population-based cohort study. Depressive symptoms were assessed with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at baseline and annually in a follow-up questionnaire over 4 years of follow-up. Clinically relevant depressive symptoms were defined as PHQ-9 score ≥ 10. PA and ST were objectively measured with the activPAL3 activity monitor. The association between hourly PA and ST data and depression was assessed with multivariate regression models adjusted for age, sex, level of education, diabetes status, BMI, alcohol, smoking, energy intake, and mobility limitation.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>At baseline, 73 participants had depression and among those without depression at baseline, 195 participants developed depression over four years of follow up (mean age 60.1 ± 8.0 years; and 49.0% women). Lower levels of PA and higher levels of ST were statistically significantly associated with prevalent depression, in particular during the weekend and in the morning hours (for PA). Only higher levels of ST in the evening and on weekend days were statistically significantly associated with incident depression.</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>The results show that participants with depression at baseline had lower levels of PA in the morning compared to participants without depression. ST and not PA, and particularly ST in the evening hours was associated with incident depression. These results may help inform the development of tailored physical activity interventions aimed to control and prevent depression.</p>
