  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>In recent years, desalination plants gained attention in areas historically suffering from water scarcity like small islands being an important source of potable water. Besides drinking water, desalination plants produce as by-product hypersaline effluents, that are generally directly disposed to the sea with no specific regulations at Italian level. The high density of the discharge can create a briny layer on the seafloor affecting marine organisms and water quality. The aim of this research is assess the effects produced by a hypersaline discharge from a small island Italian desalination plant using early warning indicators of ecosystems health and stressing on the importance of using an integrated approach through multivariate analysis.</p>

  <title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title>
  <p>The study area was monitored sampling water, sediment and benthic organisms along some transects nearby the discharge and from an uncontaminated area having similar characteristics. Samples were assessed under a chemical and ecotoxicological viewpoints. Toxicity tests were performed considering whole sediment and elutriates (solid to liquid ratio of 1:4) including 
   <italic>Alivibrio fischeri</italic> (ISO 11348-3:2007) and 
   <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> (ISO 10253: 2016).

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>Main results showed that hypersaline brine caused a general biodiversity loss, with a benthic fauna mainly dominated by the phyla Mollusca, Arthropoda and Anellida. Scarce differences in the toxicity of water samples were detected with 
   <italic>A. fischeri</italic> and 
   <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> assays. Nonetheless, negative effects tended to significantly increase near the hypersaline discharge, especially in sediment samples.

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>Significant impacts were detected onto the benthic fauna with biodiversity loss. The potential effects on general water quality and public health are still ongoing.</p>
