  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Despite the increase in the vaccination coverage (VC) for one and two doses of MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) combined vaccines, measles continues to circulate in Italy and outbreaks occur (over 8,000 cases reported between January 2017 and March 2019).</p>
  <p>In Apulia region, where two-dose measles VC has progressively increased, from 65.1% in the birth cohort 1996 to 91.5% in the birth cohort 2011, the number of cases has been consistently low and mostly attributable to small clusters. However, cases in fully immunized individuals are still observed.</p>
  <p>By analysing the recent measles outbreaks, we aimed at estimating two-dose measles vaccine effectiveness (VE) in Apulia.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>METHODS</title>
  <p>VE was estimated using the Maximum Likelihood framework and the Bayesian approach. VC in Apulia was estimated from the 16 birth-cohorts targeted by the two-dose vaccination programme (age group 7-22 years in 2018). Confirmed cases derived from measles outbreaks occurred from October 2018 to March 2019.</p>

  <title>RESULTS</title>
  <p>In Apulia region, VC estimated from 16 birth cohorts included 657,978 individuals aged 7-22 years in 2018: 537,737 have received two doses of measles vaccine and 120,241 were still unvaccinated. From October 2018 to March 2019, at least two outbreaks have occurred in Apulia, counting 10 confirmed cases of measles in the age group studied.</p>
  <p>By assuming unvaccinated individuals (n = 7), as a control of measuring background infectivity, and 2-dose vaccinated individuals (n = 3), the VE was estimated to be about 90%. For the median of the Bayesian posterior distribution we obtained VE = 0.9013 close to the maximum likelihood estimator of 90.4% and as upper 95%-CI boundary VE = 0.977. The lower boundary was 0.659.</p>

  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
  <p>The numbers alone, three measles cases in individuals with 2-dose vaccine versus the “only” 7 cases reported in unvaccinated individuals in the studied age group population, could eventually mislead to conclude that vaccine effectiveness is decreasing. However, the results show that VE is very high, over 90%. In a population where the majority of the individuals are vaccinated but vaccine coverage is still below the recommended threshold, some cases in the vaccinated group are to be expected as no vaccine can be assumed to be 100% efficacious. Therefore, only by increasing the vaccination level even further, the force of infection can be decreased due to the herd immunity and hence reducing the risk and size of sporadic measles outbreaks.</p>
