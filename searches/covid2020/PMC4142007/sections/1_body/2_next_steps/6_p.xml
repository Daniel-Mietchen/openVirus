<p>Of necessity, the list of EID agents is not, and can never be, complete due to the nature of emergence. We recognized that a system of assessing the risk and threat of EIDs for their potential impact on blood safety and availability must include a process for monitoring, identifying, evaluating, estimating disease severity, assessing risk and development of interventions. Thus, the AABB EID group is now developing a ‘toolkit’ containing the necessary ‘tools’ starting with links to EID monitoring sites (horizon scanning), risk assessment tools, a flow diagram to follow as one proceeds to determine whether intervention development and implementation are required, and methods to validate and assess the efficacy of any introduced intervention [
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The goal is ‘to develop a systematic approach to risk assessment and intervention development for the impact of emerging infections upon blood safety intended to educate and advise blood systems in a timely and accurate fashion’. When developed, this toolkit may be adapted to the needs of ISBT members.
