<p>The lessons learned from the AABB exercise are that each country or region of the world needs to decide their own priority list of infectious agents that may represent a threat to transfused recipients, as well as processes for surveillance and action should any of those agents pose an immediate safety threat. Countries, especially those in the developing world where EID agents have originated in the past such as China, sub-Saharan Africa, tropical Central and South America, may also choose to establish an epidemiologic/molecular surveillance laboratory or collaborations with any such existing laboratories to enable rapid agent identification and disease characterization.</p>
