<p>Antibody prevalence in blood donors varies greatly (&lt;1% to &gt;50%) depending on geographic location and the test used but is reproducibly seen to increase with age unrelated to a cohort effect but more likely the result of increasing prevalence over time [
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. RNA from genotype 3 can be recovered from Dutch blood donors at rates of as high as 1:3000 with sequences closely related to patients and pigs in the area [
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the same study, IgG antibody prevalence was 27%, and 3·5% for IgM, with increasing prevalence with age. Intensive pig farming in the Netherlands, as an example, may be amplifying the virus, which is then spread via contaminated meat and contaminated water used for irrigation. Even higher IgG seroprevalence rates of 52·5% have been documented in Southwest France [
 <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], linked to the consumption of locally produced pork products containing undercooked pork. In another study, 1939 blood donors in the US had a prevalence of IgG of 18·8% (95% CI: 17·0–20·5%) and 0·4% for IgM, but no donor had circulating RNA [
 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Of the 1939 donors, 916 were collected in 2006 (vs. the remainder in 2012 in which prevalence was 16·0%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0·01 vs. 2006); prevalence ranged from 3·4% in those between 18 and 35 years old to 42·2% in those &gt; 65 years old. As part of this study, a donor-recipient-linked repository was tested, in which two suspect cases of HEV transfusion transmission were investigated but neither could be confirmed. In one case, passive antibody (and RNA) was transfused, but the patient died prior to determining the infectivity of the transfused HEV RNA from the only RNA-positive donor in the study. The other case was one where the level of IgG pre-transfusion was just below the assay cut-off, and post-transfusion was just above the assay cutoff. Since further antibody evolution did not indicate recent seroconversion, the recipient was likely infected prior to transfusion. Since 1979, at least 10 transfusion transmissions have been documented worldwide including cases in Japan, the UK, France, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and India. Because HEV is non-enveloped, it is very resistant to inactivation; thus, some solvent–detergent plasma manufacturers screen plasma donors and/or pools to reduce the HEV RNA concentration (i.e. OctaPlas in the US); commercial tests are being developed to screen plasma for HEV RNA.
