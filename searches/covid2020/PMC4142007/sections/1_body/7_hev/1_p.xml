<p>Hepatitis E virus is a single-stranded, RNA-containing, small, non-enveloped virus in the genus 
 <italic>Hepesvirus</italic>. There is one serotype but four genotypes with differing geographic distribution, epidemiology and clinical features. Hepatitis E virus is globally the most common cause of acute hepatitis with an estimated 20 million incident infections per year, over 3 million acute cases and 700 000 deaths per year [
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Genotypes 1 and 2 are most commonly associated with large, explosive waterborne outbreaks along with some foodborne outbreaks similar to HAV. Genotypes 1 and 2 also are associated with an overall higher rate of acute disease and for an unknown reason with increased severity in pregnant women (20% mortality especially in the third trimester). In contrast, genotypes 3 and 4 occur in humans but commonly in swine and several other animals. Thus, infections with genotypes 3 and 4 have occurred from transmissions through food, most notably via raw or undercooked pork products containing liver and/or blood [

 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Generally, less virulent than either genotype 1 or 2, genotype 3 or 4 infection results in severe disease in immunosuppressed individuals, most notably solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients leading to chronic infection (&gt;60%), and to cirrhosis and severe liver disease in 14% of those who become chronically infected [
 <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Of 1200 SOT recipients investigated for HEV RNA in the Netherlands, 1% were positive; of those, 11 of 12 HEV-RNA-positive patients developed cirrhosis [
