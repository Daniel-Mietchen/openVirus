<p>Each blood system must consider preparing for the unknown including triggers for action (or not and why) and the development of interventions with respect to the safety of blood from EID agents. The examples reviewed represent a wide variety of agents with diverse characteristics, epidemiology, transmission routes and very different risks leading to differing considerations for the introduction of an intervention. The tool-kit development process and final product including methods to monitor EID agent emergence, identify and recognize a transfusion-transmission threat, quantify risk, and appropriately reduce the associated risk to transfusion recipients should be considered for implementation by all blood systems.</p>
