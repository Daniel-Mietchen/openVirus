<p>Another flavivirus, chikungunya virus, is endemic in many of the same tropical areas as dengue and frequently presents with similar symptoms and during the same epidemic periods but with more severe body aches, especially joint pains and crippling arthritis than that of dengue. The name ‘chikungunya’ refers to the inability to straighten up due to intense pain (‘that which bends up’ in the Makone language) [

 <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. During this outbreak, over 300 000 clinical cases on Reunion island were documented effecting over 40% of the population with 75% of those infected exhibiting symptoms with another 1·3 million cases during the same outbreak in India. The increased severity and extent of the 2005–2007 outbreak was believed to be due to a mutation affecting the viral envelope protein allowing replication in an alternate mosquito vector,

 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This resulted in increased viral loads and greater virulence as compared to replication in its primary mosquito vector, 
 <italic>A. egypti</italic>. Transfusion-transmitted risk modelling estimated a risk of up to 1500 per 100 000 donations [
 <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; however, transfusion transmission was never documented. What is notable in the islands of this French colony is the number of interventions put into place to prevent theoretic transfusion transmission. These included the suspension of blood collections in areas where risk was estimated to be higher than the risk from hepatitis B virus transfusion transmission, the implementation for platelets of pathogen inactivation and chikungunya virus RNA nucleic acid testing, and for continental France, the deferral of those who lived or travelled to an endemic area [
 <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Subsequently, an outbreak in Northern Italy occurred in 2007 involving approximately 250 cases; the viral introduction was believed to have been a clinical case in an individual returning from India, and consequently, spread locally via 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The data from this outbreak were used to validate a risk assessment tool developed to provide quantitative transmission estimates of EID risks through blood transfusion. The output of the model based on the outbreak peak estimated a prevalence of 1·07 per 10 000 donors, leading to 0·04 infectious donations, 0·13 infectious blood components and a severe outcome in 0·0001 recipients, based on an assumed 0·1% of infected individuals who develop severe disease [
 <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Subsequently, a case-control study during a chikungunya outbreak in Thailand in 2009 investigated the development of symptoms and viremia. Of 134 laboratory-confirmed positives, 9% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12) were asymptomatic controls who were RNA positive or seroconverted having a median viral load of 3·4 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> pfu/ml (range: 8·4 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> – 2·9 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu/ml) versus 91% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 122) classified as symptomatic cases with viremia for 8 or fewer days and RNA positivity for 17 or fewer days. Symptomatic individuals had a median viral load of 5·6 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu/ml (range: 1·3 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> – 2·9 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu/ml;
