<p>In August 2009, a group from the AABB in the United States [
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] published a supplement to transfusion that reviewed the definition and background of EID agents that pose a real or theoretical threat to transfusion safety, but for which, an existing effective intervention is lacking. The definition includes recognition of a new agent, a previously undetected agent or that a disease has an infectious origin and lastly, the re-emergence of a known infection after a decline in incidence. One estimate of the rate of emergence from 1940 to 2004 includes 5·3 new viruses discovered every year, of which 60–70% have an animal origin but can infect humans in cases where exposure by one of several routes occurs; the predicted rate of such emergence will continue well beyond the year 2020 [

 <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Human exposure can occur by a number of overlapping conditions, many of which humans have clearly precipitated in ‘forcing’ a new agent by mutation, species jump, failure of prior control measures, population growth and movement, transportation, behavioural changes (sanitary, dietary and war) and intensive farming practices to name a few. In addition to most EID agents having a zoonotic origin, they represent a diverse group of agents, infect by multiple transmission routes, may result in acute or chronic infections, derive from human activity, but most importantly, their emergence is unpredictable. The necessary attributes for transfusion transmission include the following: presence of the agent in blood during an asymptomatic phase in the donor, the agent's survival/persistence in blood during processing/storage and lastly that the agent must be recognized as responsible for a clinically apparent outcome in at least a proportion of recipients who become infected [

 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The response with respect to blood safety approaches to EID agents has varied related to the severity of the agent, its incidence and prevalence and rate of emergence.
