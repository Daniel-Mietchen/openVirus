<p>Originally, the AABB group identified 68 EID agents of concern to blood safety; each agent had enough evidence/likelihood of transfusion transmission (e.g. blood phase) and potential for clinical disease to warrant further consideration. In the Supplement [
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], fact sheets were published providing information on the following: agent classification; background on the disease agent's importance; the clinical syndromes/diseases caused; transmission modes (including vectors/reservoirs); likelihood of transfusion transmission, and if proven to be transfusion transmitted, information on known cases; the feasibility and predicted success of interventions that could be used for donor screening (questioning) and tests available for diagnostics or that could be adapted for donation screening; and finally, the efficacy, if known, of inactivation methods for plasma-derived products. The Supplement also included a separate section on pathogen reduction technologies for all blood components using published data. Agents were prioritized relative to their scientific/epidemiologic threat as well as their perceived threat to the community including concerns expressed by the regulators of blood. Agents given the highest priority due to a known transfusion-transmission threat, and severe/fatal disease in recipients were the vCJD prion, dengue viruses and the obligate red-cell parasite that causes babesiosis (
 <italic>B. microti</italic> and related 
 <italic>Babesia</italic>). Although the focus of the supplement was the United States and Canada, many of the agents (and the process) are applicable worldwide. Other experts have prioritized agents differently depending on their local needs with priority given to West Nile virus, dengue viruses, 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>, chikungunya virus, the agents of malaria and Lyme disease, and tick-borne encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; of note, several of these agents, including the agent of Lyme disease, have never been documented to be transfusion-transmitted.
