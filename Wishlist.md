# Wishlist

Some of the things that would immediate make this more useful or available to a wider group of people. If you want to help
she if there is a discrete task yuou can commit to. None are mission critical.

## Wishes

* **packaging** such as a Docker container. AMI has been Dockerised but needs customisation I think.
* **workflows** such as KN1ME or R. AMI has the components but some of these may be better.
* **dictionaries** There are some AMI-created ones that need validating (I think they have bugs).
* **server** would be very useful to put this under a server so people could run without downloading
* **scrapers** I have hacked about 25 publisher scrapers. Scraping is legal in UK for non-commercial purposes. Ideally people should have UK access (e.g. Univ library being supportive).
* **documentation** and narratives to show the value.
* **science** people with scienbce projects to do with the CORD-19 dataset.
