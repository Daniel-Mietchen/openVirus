    "OBJECTIVES:Virus infection is underevaluated in older adults with severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs). We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of combining point-of-care molecular viral test and serum procalcitonin (PCT) level for antibiotic stewardship in the emergency department (ED). DESIGN:A prospective twin-center cohort study was conducted between January 2017 and March 2018. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:Older adult patients who presented to the ED with SARIs received a rapid molecular test for 17 respiratory viruses and a PCT test. MEASURES:To evaluate the clinical impact, we compared the outcomes of SARI patients between the experimental cohort and a propensity score-matched historical cohort. The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED. The secondary outcomes included duration of intravenous antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS:A total of 676 patients were included, of which 169 patients were in the experimental group and 507 patients were in the control group. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the patients in the experimental group tested positive for virus. Compared with controls, the experimental group had a significantly higher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED (26.0% vs 16.1%, P = .007), neuraminidase inhibitor uses (8.9% vs 0.6%, P < .001), and shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics (10.0 vs 14.5 days, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS:Combining rapid viral surveillance and PCT test is a useful strategy for early detection of potential viral epidemics and antibiotic stewardship. Clustered viral respiratory infections in a nursing home is common. Patients transferred from nursing homes to ED may benefit from this approach."
